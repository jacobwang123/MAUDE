THE MERGE HEMODYNAMIC RECORDING SYSTEM IS USED TO MONITOR O2 SATURATION WHILE PERFORMING CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION PROCEDURES. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE SPO2 VALUE COULD FREEZE ON THE HEMO MONITOR. IF PULSE RATE IS BEING MEASURED USING THE SPO2 VALUES, THEN THE PULSE RATE ALSO FREEZES, WHICH CAUSES THE HEMO MONITOR TO DISPLAY STALE DATA. THE SITE REPORTED THE OXYGEN SATURATION LEVEL DISPLAY (SPO2) FAILED ON VERSION 9.40 OF MERGE HEMO. THE SPO2 VALUE WAS STUCK AT 85%. THE STAFF HAD A THIRD PARTY SPO2 MONITOR HOOKED UP THAT WAS READING CORRECTLY AT 100%. CHANGING THE SPO2 CLIP AND HARNESS (NELCOR) STILL READS 86% ON A DIFFERENT PATIENT. RESETTING THE PDM DOES CLEAR OUT THE READING.|3196

THE CUSTOMER REPORTED A LEAK IN THE T-CONNECTOR TUBING WHERE THE TUBING CONNECTS TO THE PLASTIC OF THE T-CONNECTOR THAT ATTACHES TO THE PIV. THIS OCCURRED WHILE INFUSING ON A PATIENT IN THE NICU;  NO HARM WAS REPORTED.|1250
IT WAS REPORTED THAT TWO STENTS WERE PLACED IN OVERLAPPING TECHNIQUE IN THE SFA AND THAT THE DISTAL STENT WAS FOUND DENTED THREE DAYS AFTER PLACEMENT. FURTHERMORE, THE VESSEL WAS FOUND OCCLUDED. THROMBECTOMY, BALLOON DILATION, FURTHER STENT PLACEMENT AND LYSIS WERE PERFORMED TO TREAT THE PATIENT. AFTER LYSIS THE PATIENT WAS FOUND FREE OF THROMBUS AND FREE OF STENOSIS. THIS REPORT ADDRESSES THE STENT IN PROXIMAL POSITION. THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORDS ARE BEING REVIEWED. THE EVENT IS CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION. ALTHOUGH THIS PRODUCT IS NOT SOLD IN THE U.S., THIS EVENT IS BEING REPORTED UNDER REGULATION 21 CFR PART 803 AS IT INVOLVES A SIMILAR DEVICE TO A PMA APPROVED DEVICE SOLD IN THE U.S. UNDER # (B)(4). THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY BARD REPRESENTS ALL OF THE KNOWN INFORMATION AT THIS TIME. DESPITE GOOD FAITH EFFORTS TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, THE COMPLAINANT/REPORTER WAS UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PROVIDE ANY FURTHER PATIENT, PRODUCT, OR PROCEDURAL DETAILS TO BARD. THE LOT HISTORY RECORDS HAVE BEEN REVIEWED WITH SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE MANUFACTURING AND INSPECTION OF THIS PRODUCT AND THE PRODUCT WAS FOUND TO HAVE MET ALL SPECIFICATIONS PRIOR TO SHIPMENT. THERE IS NO INDICATION FOR A MANUFACTURING-RELATED FAILURE. BASED ON THE IMAGES AND VIDEO CLIPS PROVIDED IT IS CONFIRMED THAT TWO STENTS WERE PLACED IN OVERLAPPING MANNER AND THAT THREE DAYS AFTER PLACEMENT THE STENTED SECTION WAS OCCLUDED. A DEFICIENCY OF THE STENT IN PROXIMAL POSITION WHICH IS SUBJECT OF THIS COMPLAINT COULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED. NO INDICATION FOR A DEVICE RELATION OF THE VESSEL OCCLUSION COULD BE DETERMINED. THEREFORE, THE INVESTIGATION OF THIS ISSUE IS CLOSED WITH INCONCLUSIVE RESULT. POTENTIAL FACTORS THAT COULD HAVE LED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT REPORTED HAVE BEEN EVALUATED. PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS OF SIMILAR COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN REVIEWED. IN THIS CASE TWO STENTS WERE PLACED OVERLAPPING AND THE STENT IN DISTAL POSITION WAS FOUND WITH A TWISTING WHICH MAY HAVE CAUSED THE OCCLUSION OF THE WHOLE STENTED SEGMENT. IN GENERAL, RESTENOSIS OF A STENT MAY BE CAUSED BY VARIOUS FACTORS AND MAY OCCUR INSIDE NON-DEFECTIVE STENTS THAT HAVE BEEN CORRECTLY PLACED. RESTENOSIS MAY BE RELATED TO THE GENERAL CONDITION OF THE PATIENT OR TO THE VASCULAR CONDITIONS OF THE PATIENT. RESTENOSIS MAY ALSO OCCUR INSIDE STENTS THAT WERE PLACED WITH AN IRREGULAR STRUT PATTERN. INSUFFICIENTLY OR NOT PERFORMED BALLOON DILATION MAY BE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS. BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AND THE EVALUATION OF THE IMAGES PROVIDED, A DEFINITE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE EVENT REPORTED COULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED. IN REVIEWING THE LABELING SUPPLIED WITH THE PRODUCT IT WAS FOUND THAT THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU) SUFFICIENTLY ADDRESSES THIS POTENTIAL RISK BY INDICATING THAT ARTERIAL OCCLUSION/ RESTENOSIS OF THE TREATED VESSEL IS A POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENT THAT MAY OCCUR. FURTHERMORE THE IFU CLOSELY DESCRIBES THE STENT PLACEMENT BY STATING: 'TO ENSURE THE MOST ACCURATE PLACEMENT, FIRMLY HOLD THE BLACK SYSTEM STABILITY SHEATH THROUGHOUT DEPLOYMENT (...) DO NOT HOLD THE SILVER STENT DELIVERY SHEATH AT ANY TIME DURING DEPLOYMENT. DO NOT CONSTRICT THE STENT DELIVERY SHEATH DURING STENT DEPLOYMENT (...) INITIATE STENT DEPLOYMENT BY ROTATING THE THUMBWHEEL IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ARROWS WHILE HOLDING THE HANDLE IN A FIXED POSITION (...) WHILE MAINTAINING A FIXED HANDLE POSITION, ROTATE THUMBWHEEL TO OBTAIN INITIAL STENT WALL APPOSITION OF 1CM MINIMUM (...) WITH DISTAL END OF THE STENT APPOSING THE VESSEL WALL, DEPLOYMENT CONTINUES WITH THE FOLLOWING METHOD (...) WHILE MAINTAINING A FIXED HANDLE POSITION, PLACE YOUR FINGER IN FRONT OF THE DEPLOYMENT SLIDE AND SLIDE IT FROM THE DISTAL TO PROXIMAL END.'. THE IFU ALSO MENTIONS BALLOON PRE AND POST DILATION: 'POST STENT EXPANSION WITH A PTA CATHETER IS RECOMMENDED.' AND 'PREDILATION OF THE LESION SHOULD BE PERFORMED USING STANDARD TECHNIQUES'. (B)(4).|1423
IT WAS REPORTED THAT TWO STENTS WERE PLACED IN OVERLAPPING TECHNIQUE IN THE SFA AND THAT THE DISTAL STENT WAS FOUND DENTED THREE DAYS AFTER PLACEMENT. FURTHERMORE, THE VESSEL WAS FOUND OCCLUDED. THROMBECTOMY, BALLOON DILATION, FURTHER STENT PLACEMENT AND LYSIS WERE PERFORMED TO TREAT THE PATIENT. AFTER LYSIS THE PATIENT WAS FOUND FREE OF THROMBUS AND FREE OF STENOSIS. THIS COMPLAINT ADDRESSES THE STENT IN DISTAL POSITION. THE LOT HISTORY RECORDS HAVE BEEN REVIEWED WITH SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE MANUFACTURING AND INSPECTION OF THIS PRODUCT AND THE PRODUCT WAS FOUND TO HAVE MET ALL SPECIFICATIONS PRIOR TO SHIPMENT. THERE IS NO INDICATION FOR A MANUFACTURING-RELATED FAILURE. BASED ON THE IMAGES AND VIDEO CLIPS PROVIDED IT IS CONFIRMED THAT TWO STENTS WERE PLACED IN OVERLAPPING MANNER AND THAT THE STENT IN DISTAL POSITION WAS FOUND TWISTED THREE DAYS AFTER PLACEMENT. THE STENTED SECTION WAS FOUND OCCLUDED. POTENTIAL FACTORS THAT COULD HAVE LED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT REPORTED HAVE BEEN EVALUATED. THEREFORE PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS OF SIMILAR COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN REVIEWED. A ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS FOR THE FAILURE MODE OF TWISTED STENTS HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY PERFORMED TO DETERMINE THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THIS KIND OF EVENT. BASED ON THE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS PERFORMED, TWISTING OF THIS KIND OF STENT IS CAUSED BY INTERACTIONS OF VARIOUS USE RELATED AND ANATOMICAL FACTORS WITH THE GIVEN STENT DESIGN. DUE TO THE HELICAL STRUCTURE THE STENT HAS AN INHERENT TENDENCY TO ROTATE CLOCKWISE UPON DEPLOYMENT OF THE DELIVERY SYSTEM. THE FAILURE MODE MAY OCCUR WHEN THIS ROTATIONAL MOVEMENT IS CONSTRICTED DURING STENT DEPLOYMENT OR WHEN ROTATIONAL FORCES ARE APPLIED EXTERNALLY ON THE STENT. THERE MAY BE ALSO VARIOUS PHYSICAL FORCES, INCLUDING INDIVIDUAL PATIENT FACTORS, CONTRIBUTING TO THE TWISTING OF A STENT IN THIS REGION. IN THIS CASE NO ISSUES WERE REPORTED DURING THE INITIAL STENT PLACEMENT. AS REPORTED THE LESION WAS PRE DILATED AND POST DILATED. BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AND THE EVALUATION OF THE IMAGES PROVIDED, A DEFINITE ROOT CAUSE COULD NOT BE DETERMINED. IN REVIEWING THE LABELING SUPPLIED WITH THIS PRODUCT IT WAS FOUND THAT THE IFU SUFFICIENTLY DESCRIBE THE CORRECT DEPLOYMENT OF THE STENT. THE IFU STATES: 'TO ENSURE THE MOST ACCURATE PLACEMENT, FIRMLY HOLD THE BLACK SYSTEM STABILITY SHEATH THROUGHOUT DEPLOYMENT (...) DO NOT HOLD THE SILVER STENT DELIVERY SHEATH AT ANY TIME DURING DEPLOYMENT. DO NOT CONSTRICT THE STENT DELIVERY SHEATH DURING STENT DEPLOYMENT (...)

MEDTRONIC RECEIVED INFORMATION VIA LITERATURE REVIEW THAT A STUDY WAS PERFORMED TO EVALUATE THE SEVEN YEAR RESULTS OF 165 CONTEGRA VALVED BOVINE JUGULAR VEIN GRAFT IMPLANTATIONS. THE STUDY POPULATION INCLUDED 165 PATIENTS IMPLANTED WITH A CONTEGRA VALVED CONDUIT (SERIAL NUMBERS NOT PROVIDED), PREDOMINANTLY MALE WITH A MEAN AGE OF 3.9 YEARS. AMONG ALL PATIENTS, 23 DEATHS OCCURRED, WHICH INCLUDED: 12 PATIENTS DIED FROM (UNSPECIFIED) HEART FAILURE OR LOW CARDIAC OUTPUT, 3 FROM RIGHT HEART FAILURE (ONE OF THEM AFTER INJURY OF THE RIGHT CORONARY ARTERY). THE CAUSES OF DEATH OF THE OTHER PATIENTS WERE AORTIC VALVE INCOMPETENCE, A PULMONARY HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS, PNEUMONIA, ANEURYSM AT THE PROXIMAL CONDUIT ANASTOMOSIS, SEPSIS, PULMONARY BLEEDING, CEREBRAL OEDEMA AND SUDDEN DEATH. 18 OF THE 23 PATIENTS DIED IN THE FIRST POSTOPERATIVE MONTH, THE OTHER 5 WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR. EXPECTED VERSUS OBSERVED MORTALITY: ACCORDING TO THE RACHS-1 RISK CLASSIFICATION, THE HOSPITAL DEATH OF 19 PATIENTS WAS TO BE EXPECTED FOR THE STUDY POPULATION. OF THESE DEATHS, TWO WERE ASSOCIATED WITH MEDTRONIC PRODUCTS. ONE WAS A PATIENT WITH HEART FAILURE, WHOSE MODERATE CONDUIT INSUFFICIENCY CONTRIBUTED TO EXHAUSTING THE ALREADY DAMAGED VENTRICLE; THE OTHER PATIENT HAD AN ANEURYSM AT THE PROXIMAL CONDUIT ANASTOMOSIS. AMONG ALL PATIENTS, 137 ADVERSE EVENTS OCCURRED, WHICH INCLUDED: 5 ENDOCARDITIS, 21 STENOSIS, 58 CASES OF CATHETER-BASED INTERVENTIONS, 7 CALCIFICATION, 1 DILATATION, 45 INSUFFICIENCY. AMONG THE ADVERSE EVENTS THERE WERE 27 EXPLANTATION NOTED AT THE END OF THE OBSERVATION PHASE, CORRESPONDING TO A 74.0 +- 0.5% FREEDOM FROM EXPLANTATION AT 7 YEARS. STENOSES OF THE PERIPHERAL PULMONARY ARTERIES WERE THE REASON FOR THE EXPLANTATION OF 10 CONTEGRAS (37.0% OF ALL EXPLANTED ONES) AFTER 2.6 +- 0.6 YEARS. TECHNICAL REASONS (ACCIDENTAL VALVE CUSP STENTING, CONDUIT DISTORTION, MUSCULAR RVOT STENOSIS, ANEURYSM OF THE RIGHT VENTRICULAR OUTFLOW TRACT, ACCESS FACILITATION TO A STENOTIC PULMONARY ARTERY BRANCH) ACCOUNTED FOR OTHER 5 EXPLANTS (18.5%) AFTER 5.11 +- 0.9 YEARS. 5 CONTEGRAS (18.5%) WERE EXPLANTED FOR ENDOCARDITIS AFTER 4.1+- 0.7 YEARS, 3 (11.1%) WERE EXPLANTED FOR VALVULAR DEGENERATION AFTER 4.2 +- 0.8 YEARS, 2 (7.4%) FOR THROMBUS FORMATION AFTER 0.6 &#6192;.8 YEARS, AND 1 FOR DILATATION AT 2.6 YEARS; 1 CONTEGRA WHICH WAS STILL WORKING WELL WAS EXPLANTED FOR OUTGROWTH AT 5 YEARS AFTER IMPLANTATION.

POST DEPLOYMENT OF A 26MM SAPIEN 3 VALVE VIA TRANSFEMORAL APPROACH, THE VALVE LANDED 80:20 AORTIC/VENTRICULAR WITH TRACE PARAVALVULAR LEAK (PVL). THERE WERE NO COMPLICATIONS AND NO EKG CHANGES THROUGHOUT THE CASE. ON POST OPERATIVE DAY (POD) 2 THE PATIENT WENT INTO 1ST DEGREE AV BLOCK AND THEN COMPLETE HEART BLOCK (CHB) AND A DUAL CHAMBER PERMANENT PACEMAKER (PPM) WAS IMPLANTED. (B)(4). PER THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE, CONDUCTION SYSTEM INJURIES (HEART BLOCK) WHICH MAY REQUIRE A PERMANENT PACEMAKER ARE POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH BALLOON AORTIC VALVULOPLASTY, DEPLOYMENT OF THE PROSTHETIC VALVE, AND THE OVERALL TAVR PROCEDURE. ACCORDING TO THE VALVE ACADEMIC RESEARCH CONSORTIUM (VARC) GUIDELINES, THE CLOSE ANATOMICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE AORTIC VALVE COMPLEX AND THE BRANCHING ATRIOVENTRICULAR BUNDLE MAY PROVIDE AN EXPLANATION FOR THESE COMPLICATIONS OF THE TAVR PROCEDURE. ACCORDING TO LITERATURE REVIEW, AND AS DOCUMENTED IN A TECHNICAL SUMMARY WRITTEN BY EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES, ATRIOVENTRICULAR CONDUCTION DISTURBANCES AFTER TAVR ARE ASSOCIATED WITH MANY PATIENT RELATED AND PROCEDURAL RELATED FACTORS, INCLUDING PRE-OPERATIVE CO-MORBID STATUS, THE DEGREE AND BULKINESS OF AORTIC VALVE AND ANNULAR CALCIFICATION, INTER-VENTRICULAR SEPTAL THICKNESS, PRE-EXISTING ELECTROCARDIOGRAM ABNORMALITIES, THE DEPTH OF PROSTHESIS IMPLANTATION, AND THE PROFILE OF THE IMPLANTED PROSTHESIS. UNLIKE CONVENTIONAL AVR, WHERE THERE MAY BE LOCALIZED TRAUMA DUE TO DECALCIFICATION OF THE ANNULUS AND/OR SUTURE PLACEMENT IN THE PROXIMITY OF THE AV NODE OR THE BUNDLES, TAVR MAY CAUSE CONDUCTION ABNORMALITIES THROUGH MECHANICAL IMPINGEMENT OF THE CONDUCTION SYSTEM BY THE PROSTHESIS. THE MECHANISMS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF HEART BLOCK AFTER TAVR ARE WELL DOCUMENTED AND DESCRIBED IN THE LITERATURE. IT IS ALSO DOCUMENTED THAT PRE-EXISTING HEART BLOCK IS COMMON IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING TAVR OR SURGICAL AVR AND ANOTHER 4-6 % WILL DEVELOP POSTOPERATIVE HEART BLOCK, POTENTIALLY REQUIRING A PERMANENT PACEMAKER. IN THIS CASE, THE CAUSE OF THE REPORTED CHBIS LIKELY RELATED TO THE MECHANISMS DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE IFU AND TRAINING MANUALS HAVE BEEN REVIEWED AND NO INADEQUACIES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED WITH REGARDS TO WARNINGS, CONTRAINDICATIONS, AND THE DIRECTIONS/CONDITIONS FOR THE SUCCESSFUL USE OF THE DEVICE. COMPLAINT HISTORIES FOR ALL REPORTED EVENTS ARE REVIEWED AGAINST TRENDING CONTROL LIMITS ON A MONTHLY BASIS, AND ANY EXCURSIONS ABOVE THE CONTROL LIMITS ARE ASSESSED AND DOCUMENTED AS PART OF THIS MONTHLY REVIEW. NO CORRECTIVE OR PREVENTATIVE ACTIONS ARE REQUIRED AT THIS TIME.|2993
THERE WAS MILD-MODERATE PARAVALVULAR LEAK (PVL) POST DEPLOYMENT OF THE FIRST VALVE AND THE OPERATOR WAS NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE POSITION OF THE FIRST VALVE. PER THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU), VALVE MALPOSITION REQUIRING INTERVENTION IS A KNOWN POTENTIAL COMPLICATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSCATHETER AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT (TAVR) PROCEDURE. THERE ARE MULTIPLE PATIENT AND PROCEDURAL FACTORS THAT ALONE OR IN COMBINATION CAN CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO VENTRICULAR MALPOSITION, INCLUDING IMPROPER POSITIONING PRIOR TO DEPLOYMENT, POOR IMAGE INTENSIFIER ANGLE, POOR COAXIAL ALIGNMENT OF THE VALVE/DELIVERY SYSTEM, A NARROW, CALCIFIED SINOTUBULAR JUNCTION, MINIMALLY OR BULKY/SEVERELY CALCIFIED AORTIC LEAFLETS, RAPID DEPLOYMENT, RELEASE OF STORED TENSION DURING DEPLOYMENT, AND MOVEMENT OF THE DELIVERY SYSTEM BY THE OPERATOR. THE THV TRAINING MANUALS INSTRUCT THE OPERATOR ON PROPER POSITIONING AND DEPLOYMENT OF THE VALVE, INCLUDING ALL PROCEDURAL AND ANATOMICAL CONSIDERATIONS. PHYSICIANS ARE EXTENSIVELY TRAINED BY EDWARDS BEFORE THEY ARE QUALIFIED TO USE THE SAPIEN 3 THV. TRAINING INCLUDES PATIENT SCREENING, DEVICE PREPARATION, APPROACH, DEPLOYMENT, IMAGING, PROCEDURE-SPECIFIC TRAINING MANUALS AND PROCTORED PROCEDURES. THE CORRECT ALIGNMENT AND POSITIONING OF THE DEVICE AT THE POINT OF DEPLOYMENT IS EMPHASIZED AS A KEY FACTOR TO THE PLACEMENT AND FIXATION OF THE DEVICE. OPERATORS ARE ALSO INSTRUCTED TO USE FLUOROSCOPY AS THE PRIMARY METHOD OF VISUALIZATION FOR POSITIONING AND DEPLOYMENT. IN PATIENTS WITH HIGH-RISK ANATOMICAL FEATURES FOR VENTRICULAR MALPOSITION (I.E. SMALL, CALCIFIED STJ, MINIMAL LEAFLET CALCIFICATION), BAV MAY PROVIDE INDICATION OF POTENTIAL BALLOON MOVEMENT DURING VALVE DEPLOYMENT. IN THIS CASE, PROCEDURAL FACTORS (THE CINE AND FLUORO FAILURE DURING DEPLOYMENT) AFFECTED THE POSITIONING OF THE S3 VALVE DURING DEPLOYMENT, CAUSING THE VALVE TO LAND IN A CANTED POSITION. THE IFU AND TRAINING MANUALS HAVE BEEN REVIEWED AND NO INADEQUACIES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED WITH REGARDS TO WARNINGS, CONTRAINDICATIONS, AND THE DIRECTIONS/CONDITIONS FOR THE SUCCESSFUL USE OF THE DEVICE. COMPLAINT HISTORIES FOR ALL REPORTED EVENTS ARE REVIEWED AGAINST TRENDING CONTROL LIMITS ON A MONTHLY BASIS, AND ANY EXCURSIONS ABOVE THE CONTROL LIMITS ARE ASSESSED AND DOCUMENTED AS PART OF THIS MONTHLY REVIEW. NO CORRECTIVE OR PREVENTATIVE ACTIONS ARE REQUIRED. DURING INITIAL DEPLOYMENT OF 26 MM SAPIEN3 VALVE VIA TRANSFEMORAL APPROACH, THE CINE AND FLUORO FAILED AND THE VALVE WAS DEPLOYED BLINDLY. WHEN FLUOROSCOPY WAS RESTORED, POST-DEPLOYMENT AORTOGRAPHY REVEALED A CANTED VALVE 98% AORTIC/ 2% VENTRICULAR AT THE NON CORONARY CUSP (NCC) AND 80% AORTIC/ 20% VENTRICULAR AT THE LEFT CORONARY CUSP (LCC). IT WAS DECIDED TO IMPLANT A SECOND 26 MM S3 VALVE WITH THE AORTIC END OF THE SECOND S3 VALVE AT THE BASE OF THE LARGE CELLS OF THE FIRST S3 VALVE. THIS DEPLOYMENT WAS PERFORMED SUCCESSFULLY RESULTING IN A FINAL GRADIENT OF 3.6 MM HG. THE PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED AND THE PATIENT WAS TRANSPORTED TO RECOVERY IS STABLE CONDITION.|1183
THE HOSPITAL REPORTED AN ISSUE ENCOUNTERED WITH THE MPS2 CONSOLE. THE PERFUSIONIST REPORTED THE CONSOLE WAS OPENING THE VENT VALVE WHEN IT SHOULDN'T HAVE WHEN GIVING CARDIOPLEGIA. THE REPORT STATED HE CLAMPED THE VENT LINE AND DISABLED THE SENSOR AND WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE THE CASE WITHOUT ISSUE. HE REPORTED THE PROCEDURE WAS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED WITH NO PATIENT COMPLICATIONS REPORTED. A FIELD SERVICE ENGINEER WILL TRAVEL TO THE ACCOUNT TO EVALUATE THE CONSOLE. THE COMPLAINT CONDITION WAS CONFIRMED. THE VENT VALVE WAS OPENING WHEN IT SHOULD NOT HAVE. THE FLUID LEVEL SENSOR WAS DEFECTIVE. ONCE IT WAS REPLACED THE CONSOLE FUNCTIONED PER SPECIFICATION. QUEST MEDICAL, INC. HAS LIMITED INFORMATION RELATED TO THE PATIENT'S MEDICAL HISTORY AND IS UNABLE TO FORM AN OPINION AS TO THE RELEVANCY OF THE PATIENT'S HISTORY TO THE EVENT REPORTED. QUEST MEDICAL, INC. DEFERS TO THE PATIENT'S PHYSICIAN REGARDING MEDICAL HISTORY.|527
"THE EVENT WAS REPORTED BY A COSTUMER FROM USA: ""THE DEVICE WAS APPARENTLY ATTACHED TO AN IV POLE THAT WAS ATTACHED TO THE STRETCHER. THE NURSE WAS TRYING TO MOVE THE STRETCHER AND NEGLECTED THAT THE SAPPHIRE PUMP WAS PLUGGED IN TO THE WALL.

DURING INVESTIGATION, THE BATTERY CAP WAS HARD TO REMOVE AND INSERT DUE TO STRIPPED THREADS ON THE BATTERY CAP. A TEST BATTERY CAP WAS ABLE TO BE INSERTED AND REMOVED WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM. THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF MOISTURE CORROSION INSIDE THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT. UNRELATED TO THE ORIGINAL COMPLAINT, THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT WAS OBSERVED TO BE CRACKED FROM THE TOP TO THE COVER. ANIMAS HAS CONDUCTED A REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD FOR THIS PUMP AND CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS OPERATING WITHIN REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS AT THE TIME OF RELEASE. ON (B)(6) 2015, THE REPORTER CONTACTED ANIMAS, ALLEGING A CASING/CONDITION (CASE DAMAGE W/MOISTURE) ISSUE. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE USER WAS UNABLE TO REMOVE THE BATTERY CAP AND THERE WAS MOISTURE PRESENT IN THE PUMP. THIS COMPLAINT IS BEING REPORTED BECAUSE THE REPORTED ISSUE WAS NOT RESOLVED WITH TROUBLESHOOTING. THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT THE PRODUCT CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO AN ADVERSE EVENT.|839

ON DEC. 3/2015, A PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION INTO A MERGE EYE STATION PROBLEM WITH SAVING FROM THE IMPORT STATION TO A SERVER FOUND THAT THE IMAGE IMPORT PROCEDURE HAD RENAMED THE HEADER FOR ONE PATIENT'S IMAGES WITH THE HEADER FOR A DIFFERENT PATIENT'S IMAGES. FURTHER INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THIS HAD HAPPENED TO OTHER IMAGES AS WELL. IN ADDITION, AT ONE POINT IN THE PAST THE DATABASE HAD BEEN ROLLED BACK AND IT APPEARS THAT OVER 2000 STORED IMAGES WERE LOST. ON (B)(6) 2015, A PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION INTO A MERGE EYE STATION PROBLEM WITH SAVING FROM THE IMPORT STATION TO A SERVER FOUND THAT THE IMAGE IMPORT PROCEDURE HAD RENAMED THE HEADER FOR ONE PATIENT'S IMAGES WITH THE HEADER FOR A DIFFERENT PATIENT'S IMAGES. FURTHER INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THIS HAD HAPPENED TO OTHER IMAGES AS WELL. IN ADDITION, AT ONE POINT IN THE PAST THE DATABASE HAD BEEN ROLLED BACK AND IT APPEARS THAT OVER 2000 STORED IMAGES WERE LOST. AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE COMPLAINT CONFIRMED THAT TWO DIFFERENT PATIENT'S EYE SCAN IMAGES WERE MERGED INTO ONE FILE. THE MERGE EYE STATION IS DESIGNED TO MITIGATE THE MERGING OF DIFFERENT PATIENT SCANS. THEREFORE, THE INVESTIGATION FOCUSED ON WHAT OCCURRED AT THE COMPLAINANT'S SITE THAT RESULTED IN THE MERGING OF TWO DIFFERENT PATIENT SCANS. MERGE TECHNICAL SUPPORT WORKED WITH THE CUSTOMER TO DETERMINE WHAT WORKFLOWS OR SITUATIONS CONTRIBUTED TO THIS MALFUNCTION. THE CUSTOMER REVEALED THAT A PREVIOUSLY DECOMMISSIONED EYECARE WORKSTATION, THAT STILL HAD PATIENT SCANS STORED ON IT, HAD BEEN BROUGHT BACK ONLINE. THIS RESURRECTION OF THE DECOMMISSIONED WORKSTATION CAUSED OLDER PATIENT SCANS TO BE MERGED WITH NEW PATIENT SCANS IN THE DATABASE. THIS OCCURRED BECAUSE SOME OLD AND NEW SCANS HAD THE SAME IDENTIFIER. MERGE TECHNICAL SUPPORT HAS WORKED WITH THE CUSTOMER AND IDENTIFIED AND QUARANTINED ALL FILES, OLD AND NEW, THAT WERE MERGED TOGETHER. THE USER WAS IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED OF THIS ISSUE WHEN ATTEMPTING TO PULL UP A NEWER PATIENT RECORD. MERGE EYE STATION IS DESIGNED TO PARSE A FILE FOR INCONSISTENT PATIENT DATA PRIOR TO OPENING THE FILE. ANY FILE OF IMAGES THAT CONTAINS INCONSISTENT PATIENT DATA, PRODUCES AN ERROR MESSAGE NOTIFYING THE USER THAT THE FILE IS IDENTIFIED FOR PATIENT X, BUT PATIENT Y'S INFORMATION IS PRESENT IN THE FILE. THE USER HAS TO CONFIRM THAT THEY WANT TO PROCEED AND VIEW THE IMAGES REGARDLESS OF THE ERROR. INVESTIGATION ACTIVITIES DID CONFIRM A MALFUNCTION THAT RESULTED IN THE MERGING OF DISSIMILAR PATIENT SCANS. HOWEVER, THIS MALFUNCTION OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF A DECOMMISSIONED EYE STATION BEING BROUGHT BACK ONLINE WITH OLD PATIENT DATA STILL RESIDING ON THE SYSTEM. A SITUATION SUCH AS THIS IS NOT LIKELY TO OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. ANY INCONSISTENT PATIENT INFORMATION IN AN EYE STATION FILE CAUSES AN ERROR MESSAGE TO APPEAR. THIS ERROR IS READILY APPARENT TO THE USER. THE COMPLAINANT CONFIRMED THAT NO PATIENT INJURY OR DEATH OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THIS MALFUNCTION.|3197
THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT NS WAS LEAKING FROM A TAXOL INFUSION AT THE TEXIUM CONNECTION WITH THE PRIMARY FLUID IV BAG DURING THE BEGINNING OF THE INFUSION.

CONCOMITANT PRODUCT: BBRAUN 250ML IV BAG OF 0.9% NACL INJECTION USP, LOT J5J076, EXP 07/17, THERAPY DATE (B)(6) 2015. THE CUSTOMER?S REPORT OF FLUID LEAKAGE AT THE TEXIUM CONNECTION WAS NOT CONFIRMED. THE SUSPECT SET WAS NOT RECEIVED FOR INVESTIGATION. VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE RECEIVED CONCOMITANT PRIMARY SET SHOWED NO DAMAGE OR ANY ANOMALIES. FUNCTIONAL AND PRESSURE TESTING WAS PERFORMED AND NO LEAKS WERE OBSERVED. THE ROOT CAUSE WAS NOT IDENTIFIED.|1250
FOLLOW-UP # 1 DATE OF SUBMISSION 2/04/2016. DEVICE EVALUATION: THE DEVICE HAS BEEN RETURNED AND EVALUATED BY PRODUCT ANALYSIS ON 1/28/2016 WITH THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS: DURING VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE PUMP, IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE PUMP WAS RETURNED WITH A CRACK ALONGSIDE THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT AND THE THREADS ON THE RETURNED BATTERY CAP WERE STRIPPED AND WERE UNABLE TO SECURE. A TEST CAP WAS USED TO COMPLETE THE INVESTIGATION AND IT WAS ABLE TO SECURE TO THE PUMP.|859
BACTERIOLOGICAL TESTING WAS NOT PERFORMED. THE CLINICAL JUDGMENT OF THE INFLAMMATION WAS DETERMINED TO BE NON INFECTIOUS ACCORDING TO CLINICAL FINDINGS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF STEROIDS. ALCON IS CONDUCTING AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION OF REPORTS OF POST-OPERATIVE INFLAMMATION THAT WERE REPORTED IN CATARACT SURGERY PATIENTS IMPLANTED WITH RESTOR AND RESTOR TORIC FAMILY OF IOLS IN (B)(6) SINCE MID-JANUARY 2015. IN THE INTEREST OF PATIENT SAFETY, ALL RESTOR AND RESTOR TORIC IOLS WERE VOLUNTARILY RECALLED FROM THE (B)(6) MARKET ON 15-APR-2015 AND SURGEONS IN (B)(6) WERE ADVISED NOT TO IMPLANT THE RESTOR AND RESTOR TORIC FAMILY OF IOLS. FOLLOWING THIS RECALL, AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CASES OF POST-OPERATIVE INFLAMMATION WERE REPORTED FOR ACRYSOF? IQ TORIC IOL MODELS SN6AT6, SN6AT7, SN6AT8 AND SN6AT9. THEREFORE, ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2015 THE VOLUNTARY RECALL WAS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE THESE ADDITIONAL LENS MODELS. PRODUCT EVALUATION: PRODUCT HISTORY AND BATCH RECORDS WERE REVIEWED AND DOCUMENTATION INDICATED THE PRODUCT MET RELEASE CRITERIA. ROOT CAUSE HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED. THERE HAVE BEEN NO OTHER COMPLAINTS REPORTED IN THE LOT NUMBER. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN REQUESTED THE MANUFACTURER INTERNAL REFERENCE NUMBER IS: (B)(4). A DOCTOR REPORTED POSTOPERATIVE ENDOPHTHALMITIS FOLLOWING A CATARACT INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL) IMPLANT PROCEDURE. PRODUCT SAMPLE IS UNAVAILABLE FOR RETURN AS IT REMAINS IMPLANTED.

PRODUCT EVALUATION: ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED, WHICH INDICATED AN UNSPECIFIED DELIVERY SYSTEM WAS USED WITH THE VISCOELASTIC. THE LENS MODEL WAS 27.5 DIOPTER, AND IS ONLY QUALIFIED FOR USE WITH A SPECIFIC CARTRIDGE/VISCOELASTIC COMBINATION. IT IS UNKNOWN IF THE APPROVED VISCOELASTIC WAS USED. NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED TO CONDUCT A REVIEW ON THE CARTRIDGE LOT. THE PRODUCT INVESTIGATION COULD NOT IDENTIFY A ROOT CAUSE. A CLINICAL MANAGER REPORTED AN INTRAOCULAR LENS (IOL) THAT WAS EXCHANGED DUE TO VISION REMAINING CLOUDY IN THE PATIENT'S EYE. THE IOL WAS DECENTERED AND WAS NOT ABLE TO BE REPOSITIONED.|3191
PATIENT'S MOTHER CONTACTED DEXCOM ON (B)(6) 2015, TO REPORT THAT THE PATIENT EXPERIENCED SKIN IRRITATION UNDER THE SENSOR PATCH ON (B)(6) 2015. SENSOR WAS INSERTED AT THE LEG ON (B)(6) 2015. PATIENT'S MOTHER DESCRIBED THE SKIN REACTION AS A RED, ITCHY AND BUMPY RASH UNDER THE SENSOR PATCH. PATIENT'S MOTHER TREATS THE AFFECTED AREA WITH TRIAMCINOLONE ACETONIDE, PRESCRIBED BY THE PATIENT'S DERMATOLOGIST. DATE OF PRESCRIPTION AND MEDICAL INTERVENTION IS UNKNOWN. NO ADDITIONAL EVENT OR PATIENT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE DEXCOM G4 PLATINUM CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING SYSTEM USERS GUIDE STATES: INSERTING THE SENSOR AND WEARING THE ADHESIVE PATCH MIGHT CAUSE INFECTION, BLEEDING, PAIN OR SKIN IRRITATIONS (REDNESS, SWELLING, BRUISING, ITCHING, SCARRING, OR SKIN DISCOLORATION). ADDITIONALLY, IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE DEXCOM G4 PLATINUM CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING SYSTEM USERS GUIDE STATES: DO NOT INSERT THE SENSOR IN SITES OTHER THAN THE BELLY (ABDOMEN) OR UPPER BUTTOCKS.|2993
"THE CUSTOMER BELIEVES THAT THE STANDARDIZED UPTAKE VALUES (SUV) MEASUREMENTS ARE NOT AS ACCURATE WHEN THE MPR IS DONE USING A 2D IMAGE. AT THE TIME OF THIS REPORT, THE DEGREE OF INACCURACY AND ITS CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE HAS NOT BEEN CONFIRMED. INVESTIGATION INTO THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM IS UNDERWAY AT THE TIME OF THIS REPORT. AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE COMPLAINT FROM A CUSTOMER WHO ALLEGED THAT THE STANDARDIZED UPTAKE VALUE (SUV) MEASUREMENTS ARE NOT AS ACCURATE WHEN THE MPR IS DONE USING A 2D IMAGE, HAS FOUND THAT THE SUV MEASUREMENTS ARE ACCURATE IN 2D AND 3D . EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THIS CONCLUSION INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING: A MERGE HEALTHCARE IMPLEMENTATION ENGINEER CONTACTED THE CUSTOMER TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND TO SEE IF THE END USER WOULD HAVE ANY EXAMPLES OF THE ALLEGATION AVAILABLE. A WEB MEETING WAS HELD WITH AN ENGINEER AT MERGE AND A PHYSICIAN AT THE COMPLAINANT'S FACILITY. THE PHYSICIAN COMPLETED SUV MEASUREMENTS ON THE SAME PET/CT IMAGE USING THREE DIFFERENT VIEWERS: ""NORMAL"" PACS VIEWER, THE MPR SINGLE VIEWER AND THE MPR FOUR PANEL VIEWER. THE PHYSICIAN FOUND ALL OF THE SUV MEASUREMENTS WERE WITHIN APPROXIMATELY 1/10TH OF EACH OTHER. THE PHYSICIAN ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THESE MEASUREMENTS WERE ACCEPTABLE FOR HIM AND HIS PRACTICE. TO ENSURE THAT THE MERGE PACS PRODUCT FUNCTIONS AS EXPECTED, A MERGE SENIOR SOFTWARE DEVELOPER INVESTIGATED THE MERGE PACS SUV CALCULATION RELATED CODE. THE DEVELOPER CONFIRMED THAT THE CODE FUNCTIONS AS INTENDED. ADDITIONALLY, WHEN A REQUIRED SUV VARIABLE SUCH AS PATIENT WEIGHT, IS NOT AVAILABLE IN THE STUDY, A VALUE OF ""N/A"" IS DISPLAYED FOR THE MEASUREMENT. THE INVESTIGATION INTO THIS COMPLAINT ALSO DETERMINED THAT MERGE PACS WAS TESTED ACCORDING TO THE QUANTITATIVE IMAGING BIOMARKERS ALLIANCE (QIBA)/ RADIOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF NORTH AMERICA (RSNA) DIGITAL REFERENCE OBJECT (DRO) GUIDANCE. MERGE HEALTHCARE HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THIS REPORT AND COMPLETED THE SUV CALCULATIONS USING THE DRO. ALL TEST DATA WAS FOUND ACCEPTABLE. IN CONCLUSION, MERGE HEALTHCARE'S INVESTIGATION INTO THE ALLEGED INACCURATE SUV MEASUREMENTS WERE MOST LIKELY DUE TO A USER ERROR. MERGE PACS SATISFIES THE RSNA/QIBA GUIDELINES FOR SUV MEASUREMENTS. THE CUSTOMER WAS ABLE TO CONFIRM AFTER ADDITIONAL RESEARCH AND CALCULATIONS USING 3 DIFFERENT VIEWERS, THAT THE SUV MEASUREMENTS WERE WITHIN AN ACCEPTABLE RANGE. MERGE HEALTHCARE'S INVESTIGATION CONFIRMED THAT THIS IS NOT A DEVICE MALFUNCTION AND THERE WAS NO INJURY, POTENTIAL INJURY OR DEATH."|1535
UPON RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW, THIS ISSUE WAS DETERMINED TO BE A REPORTABLE MDR. IT WAS REPORTED THAT PATIENT DEMOGRAPHIC DATA UPDATES IN MERGE PACS ARE NOT REFLECTING IN ICONNECT ACDESS 4.0. THE IMAGES ARE BEING PULLED WITH STALE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA. THE CORRECT STUDY LAUNCHES, THE STUDY'S TITLE BAR IS CORRECT, BUT THE DEMOGRAPHICS WITHIN THE VIEWPORT MAY CONFLICT. THE USER CAN GO BACK TO MERGE PACS TO CHECK THE INFORMATION. THE MANUFACTURER REVIEWED THE COMPLAINTS DATABASE TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS, AND NONE WERE IDENTIFIED.|3197

PATIENT'S MOTHER CONTACTED DEXCOM ON (B)(6) 2015 TO REPORT CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING (CGM) INACCURACIES COMPARED TO BLOOD GLUCOSE (BG) METER THAT OCCURRED ON (B)(6) 2015. SENSOR WAS INSERTED ON (B)(6) 2015 INTO THE ARM. THE DEXCOM G4 PLATINUM (PEDIATRIC) CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING SYSTEM USER'S GUIDE STATES: DO NOT INSERT THE SENSOR IN SITES OTHER THAN THE BELLY (ABDOMEN) OR UPPER BUTTOCKS. USE IN OTHER SITES MIGHT CAUSE SENSOR GLUCOSE READINGS TO BE INACCURATE AND COULD RESULT IN YOU MISSING SEVERE HYPOGLYCEMIA (LOW BLOOD GLUCOSE) OR HYPERGLYCEMIA (HIGH BLOOD GLUCOSE) EVENTS. ADDITIONALLY IT WAS REPORTED THAT AN ALTERNATE BLOOD GLUCOSE TEST WAS USED. THE DEXCOM G4 PLATINUM CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING SYSTEM USER'S GUIDE STATES: DO NOT USE ALTERNATIVE BLOOD GLUCOSE SITE TESTING (BLOOD FROM YOUR PALM OR FOREARM, ETC.) FOR CALIBRATION. ALTERNATIVE SITE BLOOD GLUCOSE VALUES MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THOSE TAKEN FROM A FINGERSTICK BLOOD GLUCOSE VALUE AND MAY NOT REPRESENT THE TIMELIEST BLOOD GLUCOSE VALUE. USE A BLOOD GLUCOSE VALUE TAKEN ONLY FROM A FINGERSTICK FOR CALIBRATION. ALTERNATIVE SITE BLOOD GLUCOSE VALUES MIGHT AFFECT SENSOR PERFORMANCE, AND YOU MIGHT MISS A LOW OR HIGH BLOOD GLUCOSE VALUE. AT THE TIME OF CONTACT, NO INJURY OR MEDICAL INTERVENTION WAS REPORTED.|1670
PATIENT CONTACTED DEXCOM ON (B)(6) 2015 TO REPORT CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING (CGM) INACCURACIES COMPARED TO BLOOD GLUCOSE (BG) METER THAT OCCURRED ON (B)(6) 2015. SENSOR WAS INSERTED ON (B)(6) 2015. IT WAS REPORTED THAT CALIBRATION WAS NOT PERFORMED CORRECTLY. THE DEXCOM G4 PLATINUM CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING SYSTEM USER'S GUIDE STATES: DO NOT CALIBRATE WHEN YOUR RECEIVER SCREEN IS SHOWING THE RISING SINGLE ARROW OR DOUBLE ARROW. ALSO, DO NOT CALIBRATE WHEN YOUR RECEIVER SCREEN IS SHOWING THE FALLING SINGLE ARROW OR DOUBLE ARROW. CALIBRATING DURING SIGNIFICANT RISE OR FALL OF BLOOD GLUCOSE MAY AFFECT ACCURACY OF SENSOR GLUCOSE READINGS. DO NOT CALIBRATE IF THE GLUCOSE READING ERROR SYMBOL SHOWS IN THE STATUS AREA. DO NOT CALIBRATE IF THE OUT OF RANGE SYMBOL SHOWS IN THE STATUS AREA. AT THE TIME OF CONTACT, NO INJURY OR MEDICAL INTERVENTION WAS REPORTED.|2913
IN A TRANSFEMORAL TAVR PROCEDURE, JUST WHEN THEY WERE DEFLATING THE DELIVERY SYSTEM BALLOON, THE PATIENT WENT INTO COMPLETE HEART BLOCK AND PACING CAPTURE WAS LOST. THE SAPIEN 3 VALVE LANDED 80:20 AORTIC/VENTRICULAR. THE BLOOD PRESSURE WAS VERY LOW AND IT TOOK A WHILE TO RECOVER. THE SAPIEN 3 VALVE WAS FINE WITH NO PARAVALVULAR LEAK (PVL), BUT THEY NOTICED AN ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT (ASD) AND A VENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT (VSD). IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO DO ANYTHING BECAUSE THE TRICUSPID VALVE WAS IN BETWEEN THE ASD AND VSD. THE SCREW-IN-LEAD WAS LEFT IN PLACE. THE PATIENT WAS IN CRITICAL CONDITION. AFTER REVIEWING THE IMAGES IT WAS FELT THAT A RIDGE OF CALCIUM RUNNING UP THE SEPTUM AND THE TRICUSPID VALVE MAY HAVE CAUSE THE EVENT. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RECEIVED: BAV WAS PERFORMED WITH A 23X4 BALLOON. THE S3 VALVE WAS DEPLOYED WITH NOMINAL VOLUME, POST DILATATION WAS NOT PERFORMED. THIS CASE WAS PREPARED BY THE FACILITY, NO 3MENSIO REPORT WAS DONE. THE PATIENT STABILIZED POST PROCEDURE AND WAS DISCHARGED HOME ON POD-4 WITHOUT ADDITIONAL INTERVENTION. PER THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU) CARDIOVASCULAR INJURY, SUCH AS PERFORATION OR DAMAGE (DISSECTION) OF VESSELS, VENTRICLE, MYOCARDIUM OR VALVULAR STRUCTURES, IS A KNOWN POTENTIAL COMPLICATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE TAVR PROCEDURE. VSDS MAY BE OF CONGENITAL ORIGIN, MAY BE ACQUIRED AS A RESULT OF PENETRATING TRAUMA, BLUNT TRAUMA, POST-SURGICAL CONTUSION, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION OR PERFORATION AT CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION. POST MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION VSDS IS A RARE BUT SERIOUS COMPLICATION, WHICH MAY RESULT IN CARDIAC WALL RUPTURE. SEPTAL PERFORATION DEVELOPS ON THE AVERAGE 2?3 DAYS AFTER MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. PHYSICIANS ARE EXTENSIVELY TRAINED BY EDWARDS BEFORE THEY ARE QUALIFIED TO USE THE SAPIEN 3 TRANSCATHETER HEART VALVE (THV). THE THV TRAINING MANUALS PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO FACILITATE SAFE CROSSING OF THE NATIVE VALVE, INCLUDING CAMERA PROJECTIONS, HANDLING DURING ADVANCEMENT, AND TROUBLESHOOTING TECHNIQUES IF DIFFICULTY IS ENCOUNTERED. AS STATED, EXCESSIVE FORCE SHOULD NOT BE USED WHEN THE DEVICE HAS DIFFICULTY CROSSING THE STENOTIC VALVE. ADDING TENSION TO THE WIRE, PULLING BACK THE SYSTEM TO RE-ORIENT THE VALVE, AS NEEDED, AND TORQUING OF THE FLEX CATHETER MAY BE HELPFUL IN SOLVING THE PROBLEM. IN THIS CASE, THE EXACT CAUSE OF THE VENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT CANNOT BE CONFIRMED. HOWEVER, PER REPORT IT APPEARS THAT A PIECE OF CALCIUM LOCATED BETWEEN THE SEPTUM AND THE TRICUSPID VALVE MAY HAVE BEEN PUSHED AGAINST THE TISSUE, CAUSING THE EVENTS. THE IFU AND TRAINING MANUALS HAVE BEEN REVIEWED AND NO INADEQUACIES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED WITH REGARDS TO WARNINGS, CONTRAINDICATIONS, AND THE DIRECTIONS/CONDITIONS FOR THE SUCCESSFUL USE OF THE DEVICE. COMPLAINT HISTORIES FOR ALL REPORTED EVENTS ARE REVIEWED AGAINST TRENDING CONTROL LIMITS ON A MONTHLY BASIS, AND ANY EXCURSIONS ABOVE THE CONTROL LIMITS ARE ASSESSED AND DOCUMENTED AS PART OF THIS MONTHLY REVIEW. NO CORRECTIVE OR PREVENTATIVE ACTIONS ARE REQUIRED.|2993

(B)(4) STENT DEPLOYMENT SUTURE BROKEN. (B)(4) STENT PARTIALLY DEPLOYED. ALTHOUGH THE SUSPECT DEVICE HAS BEEN RECEIVED, THE EVALUATION HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED. THEREFORE, THE CAUSE OF THE REPORTED MALFUNCTION HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED. UPON COMPLETION OF THE FAILURE ANALYSIS OF THE COMPLAINT DEVICE, IF THERE IS ANY FURTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION FROM THAT REVIEW, A SUPPLEMENTAL MEDWATCH WILL BE FILED. AN ULTRAFLEX ESOPHAGEAL STENT AND DELIVERY SYSTEM WERE RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS. VISUAL EXAMINATION OF THE RETURNED DEVICE FOUND THAT THE STENT WAS PARTIALLY DEPLOYED WITH THE DEPLOYMENT SUTURE BROKEN AND THE CATHETER WAS BENT. THE END OF THE DEPLOYMENT SUTURE APPEARED FRAYED AND HAD BEEN PULLED THROUGH OUT OF THE CATHETER, AND THE PULL RING WAS NOT RETURNED; IT WAS POSSIBLE TO MANUALLY DEPLOY THE STENT BY PULLING ON THE BROKEN DEPLOYMENT SUTURE WITH NO ISSUE. NO OTHER ISSUES WERE IDENTIFIED DURING THE PRODUCT ANALYSIS. DEVICE ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT THE CONDITION OF THE RETURNED DEVICE WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPLAINT INCIDENT AS THE STENT WAS RECEIVED PARTIALLY DEPLOYED AND THE DEPLOYMENT SUTURE WAS BROKEN. THE NOTED DAMAGES TO THE RETURNED DEVICE WERE CONSISTENT WITH EXCESSIVE FORCE BEING APPLIED DURING DEPLOYMENT AND ARE LIKELY DUE TO ANATOMICAL OR PROCEDURAL FACTORS SUCH AS TORTUOUS ANATOMY OR MANEUVERING OF THE DEVICE. THEREFORE, A REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION INDICATED THAT THE MOST PROBABLE ROOT CAUSE IS OPERATIONAL CONTEXT. IT WAS REPORTED TO BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORPORATION ON (B)(4) 2015, THAT AN ULTRAFLEX ESOPHAGEAL NG DISTAL RELEASE COVERED STENT WAS TO BE USED IN THE ESOPHAGUS DURING AN UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL ENDOSCOPY PROCEDURE PERFORMED ON (B)(6) 2015.

THE INVESTIGATION COULD NOT BE COMPLETED; NO CONCLUSION COULD BE DRAWN, AS NO PRODUCT WAS RECEIVED. DHR REVIEW - PART NUMBER: 03.632.036. LOT NUMBER: 6719147. RELEASE TO WAREHOUSE DATE: NOVEMBER 2, 2011. MANUFACTURING SITE IS SYNTHES MONUMENT AND SUPPLIED BY (B)(4)MANUFACTURING CENTER. NO NCRS WERE GENERATED DURING PRODUCTION. REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD(S) SHOWED THAT THERE WERE NO ISSUES DURING THE MANUFACTURE OF THIS PRODUCT THAT WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THIS COMPLAINT CONDITION. DEVICE WAS USED FOR TREATMENT, NOT DIAGNOSIS. IF INFORMATION IS OBTAINED THAT WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE INITIAL MEDWATCH, A FOLLOW-UP MEDWATCH WILL BE FILED AS APPROPRIATE. DEVICE WAS USED FOR TREATMENT, NOT DIAGNOSIS. A PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT INVESTIGATION WAS PERFORMED FOR THE SUBJECT DEVICE (MATRIX HOLDING SLEEVE?LONG, PART NUMBER 03.632.036, LOT 6719147). THE RETURNED INSTRUMENT WAS EXAMINED AND THE COMPLAINT CONDITION WAS ABLE TO BE CONFIRMED AS THE AS THE THREADED TIP WAS FOUND TO BE BROKEN AND MISSING APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE FIRST TWO THREADS. PER THE TECHNIQUE GUIDE THE LOCKING-HOLDING SLEEVE (03.632.036) ONE OF SEVEN (7) HOLDINGS SLEEVES FOR THE MATRIX SPINE SYSTEM UTILIZED DURING SCREW INSERTION (03.632.001, 03.632.036, 03.632.024, 03.632.028, 03.632.085, 03.616.042 AND 03.616.043). THE MATRIX SYSTEM IS COVERED BY THREE TECHNIQUE GUIDES: MATRIX ? DEFORMITY, MATRIX-DEGENERATIVE AND MATRIX ? MIS. ONCE THE LOCKING HOLDING SLEEVE IS ENGAGED WITH THE DRIVER SHAFT, IT CAN BE THREADED INTO THE PROXIMAL END OF THE MATRIX SCREW BY ROTATING THE HOLDING SLEEVE?S GREEN KNOB CLOCKWISE UNTIL IT IS FULLY ENGAGED. RELEVANT DRAWINGS FOR THE RETURNED INSTRUMENT WERE REVIEWED: THE TIP GEOMETRY ON THE INNER SLEEVE WAS CHANGED TO A MORE CONSTANT OUTER DIAMETER AND THE MATERIAL OF THE OUTER SLEEVE CHANGED FROM RADEL PLASTIC TO ANODIZED TITANIUM. THE RETURNED INSTRUMENT WAS MANUFACTURED AFTER THESE CHANGES WERE APPLIED (MFG 02NOV2011). THE DESIGN, MATERIALS AND FINISHING PROCESSES WERE FOUND TO BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE INTENDED USE OF THESE DEVICES. A DEVICE HISTORY REVIEW WAS PERFORMED FOR THE RETURNED INSTRUMENT?S LOT NUMBERS AND NO COMPLAINT-RELATED ISSUES WERE IDENTIFIED WITH THE LOT NUMBERS WHICH MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE COMPLAINT CONDITION. ALTHOUGH THE COMPLAINT CONDITION WAS CONFIRMED, A DEFINITIVE ROOT CAUSE COULD NOT BE DETERMINED. THE FAILURE MODE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE APPLICATION OF AN OFF-AXIS LOAD WHILE ENGAGING A SCREW. IF INFORMATION IS OBTAINED THAT WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE INITIAL MEDWATCH, A FOLLOW-UP MEDWATCH WILL BE FILED AS APPROPRIATE. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE THREADS ON A HOLDING SLEEVE CONTAINED A CHIP ON THE END. THIS WAS FOUND DURING A ROUTINE INSPECTION; THERE WAS NO PATIENT INVOLVEMENT. THERE IS CURRENTLY NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. THIS IS REPORT 1 OF 1 FOR (B)(4).|1261
A REPORT WAS RECEIVED THAT THE STENT OF A 7 X 30MM 135CM PRECISE PRO RX CAROTID SYSTEM PREMATURELY DEPLOYED PRIOR TO USE ON A PATIENT. THIS ISSUE WAS NOTED WHEN THE DEVICE WAS REMOVED FROM ITS? PACKAGING. THE PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED WITH ANOTHER 7 X 30MM 135CM PRECISE PRO RX DEVICE WITH NO REPORTED PATIENT INJURY. ONE NON STERILE UNIT PRECISE PRO RX OUS CAROTID SYSTEM, 5F, 7MM X 30MM, 135 CM WAS RECEIVED WITH AN OPEN HEMOSTASIS VALVE AND WITH A RETURNED BUT DEPLOYED STENT. TWO KINK CONDITIONS WERE OBSERVED ON THE WIRE LUMEN AT 2.5 CM AND 5CM FROM THE DISTAL TIP. DRIED BLOOD RESIDUALS WERE OBSERVED. DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE STROKE LENGTH (PIN-PULL SDS) FOUND THAT THE DEVICE WAS WITHIN SPECIFICATION. FUNCTIONAL TESTING COULD NOT BE PERFORMED SINCE THE STENT HAD BEEN DEPLOYED. THE DEVICE AND STENT WERE INSPECTED UNDER THE VISION SYSTEM THAT CONFIRMED THE WIRE LUMEN KINKS. NO DAMAGES WERE OBSERVED ON THE STENT. A REVIEW OF THE MANUFACTURING RECORDS REVEALED THAT IT MET SPECIFICATION PRIOR TO RELEASE. THE REPORTED ?STENT DELIVERY SYSTEM (SDS) - DEPLOYMENT DIFFICULTY-PREMATURE/PRIOR TO USE? WAS CONFIRMED BASED ON THE VISUAL ANALYSIS. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS EVENT AND THE KINKS MAY BE RELATED TO THE HANDLING PROCESS AS THE PRODUCT WAS RECEIVED WITH THE HEMOSTASIS VALVE ALREADY OPEN. ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU), THIS DEVICE IS SHIPPED WITH THE HEMOVALVE IN THE OPEN POSITION. THEY ARE FURTHER INSTRUCTED TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO PREMATURELY DEPLOY THE STENT DURING PREPARATION. THE PREPARATION OF THE DEVICE SHOULD BE DONE IN THE TRAY WITH CLOSURE OF THE HEMOVALVE PRIOR TO THE DEVICE?S REMOVAL FROM THE TRAY. USERS ARE INSTRUCTED NOT TO USE THE DEVICE IF THE STENT IS PARTIALLY DEPLOYED. IF THE USER SUSPECTS THAT THE STERILITY OR PERFORMANCE OF THE DEVICE HAS BEEN COMPROMISED, THEY ARE INSTRUCTED TO NOT USE THE DEVICE. GIVEN THE RESULTS OF THE PRODUCT ANALYSIS, PROCEDURAL FACTORS MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED EVENT. NEITHER THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD REVIEW NOR THE PRODUCT ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT THE REPORTED EVENT WAS RELATED TO THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS.

LOT NUMBER: 7455952.  RELEASE TO WAREHOUSE DATE: APRIL 16, 2014. MANUFACTURING SITE IS SYNTHES (B)(4) AND SUPPLIED BY CRITERION TOOL & DIE.  NO NCRS WERE GENERATED DURING PRODUCTION. REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD(S) SHOWED THAT THERE WERE NO ISSUES DURING THE MANUFACTURE OF THIS PRODUCT THAT WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THIS COMPLAINT CONDITION. DEVICE WAS USED FOR TREATMENT, NOT DIAGNOSIS. IF INFORMATION IS OBTAINED THAT WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE INITIAL MEDWATCH, A FOLLOW-UP MEDWATCH WILL BE FILED AS APPROPRIATE. A PRODUCT INVESTIGATION WAS COMPLETED: THE COMPLAINT CONDITION IS CONFIRMED AS THE DRIVE SHAFT WAS RECEIVED WITH A PORTION OF THE DISTAL TIP, WHICH MATES WITH THE REAMER HEAD, BROKEN OFF. SPECIFIC DETAILS REGARDING THE TECHNIQUE USED/HANDLING IS UNKNOWN; HOWEVER, IT IS MOST PROBABLE THAT EXCESSIVE FORCE AND/OR USE OF AN INCORRECT DRIVE UNIT REPEATEDLY OVER TORQUING THE DRIVE SHAFT OF THE DEVICE RESULTED IN FATIGUE AND THAT APPLIED FORCE THEREAFTER LIKELY PERMITTED FINAL SEPARATION OF THE DISTAL TIP. THE RETURNED PART WAS DETERMINED TO BE SUITABLE FOR THE INTENDED USE WHEN EMPLOYED AND MAINTAINED AS RECOMMENDED. PER THE TECHNIQUE GUIDE, THE DRIVE SHAFT IS ATTACHED TO THE CORRESPONDING LENGTH REAMER/IRRIGATOR/ASPIRATOR (RIA) TUBE ASSEMBLY AND A REAMER HEAD AND THEN CONNECTED TO A DRIVE UNIT. THE RIA SYSTEM IS INTENDED FOR USE TO CLEAR THE MEDULLARY CANAL, TO SIZE THE MEDULLARY CANAL, TO HARVEST BONE AND BONE MARROW, AND TO REMOVE INFECTED AND NECROTIC BONE. THE DRIVE SHAFT WAS RECEIVED WITH A PORTION OF THE DISTAL TIP, WHICH MATES WITH THE REAMER HEAD, BROKEN OFF. THE ROUGHLY SPIRAL BREAK IS LOCATED BETWEEN 7MM AND 19MM OF THE DISTAL EDGE OF THE DRIVE SHAFT HELIX. THE HELIX IS INTACT AND THE BROKEN DISTAL PORTION WAS NOT RECEIVED. THE BALANCE OF THE DEVICE IS IN WORKING CONDITION. THUS, THE COMPLAINT CONDITION IS CONFIRMED AND CONSISTENT WITH THE REPORTED CONDITION BUT CANNOT BE REPLICATED AS THE SHAFT IS ALREADY BROKEN. A REVIEW OF THE CURRENT DESIGN DRAWING / MANUFACTURED REVISION FOR THE TOP LEVEL ASSEMBLY AND THE DRIVE SHAFT COMPONENT WAS PERFORMED. DURING THE INVESTIGATION NO PRODUCT DESIGN ISSUES OR DISCREPANCIES WERE OBSERVED THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE COMPLAINT CONDITION. THE RETURNED PART WAS DETERMINED TO BE SUITABLE FOR THE INTENDED USE WHEN EMPLOYED AND MAINTAINED AS RECOMMENDED. DURING THE INVESTIGATION NO PRODUCT DESIGN ISSUES OR DISCREPANCIES WERE OBSERVED THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE COMPLAINT CONDITION. DEVICE WAS USED FOR TREATMENT, NOT DIAGNOSIS.

DEVICE IS AN INSTRUMENT AND IS NOT IMPLANTED/EXPLANTED. THE DEVICE WAS RECEIVED, THE INVESTIGATION COULD NOT BE COMPLETED, AND NO CONCLUSION COULD BE DRAWN, AS PRODUCT IS ENTERING THE COMPLAINT SYSTEM. DHR REVIEW - MANUFACTURING LOCATION: (B)(4). MANUFACTURING DATE: 05 SEPTEMBER 2014. NO NCR'S WERE GENERATED DURING PRODUCTION THAT WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE COMPLAINT CONDITION. THE REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD SHOWS THAT THERE WERE NO ISSUES DURING THE MANUFACTURE OF THE PRODUCT THAT WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE COMPLAINT CONDITION. DEVICE WAS USED FOR TREATMENT, NOT DIAGNOSIS. IF INFORMATION IS OBTAINED THAT WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE INITIAL MEDWATCH, A FOLLOW-UP MEDWATCH WILL BE FILED AS APPROPRIATE. IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A PRE-SURGERY EQUIPMENT INSPECTION BY THE SURGEON, THERE WAS A BEND IN THE 11.0MM/8.0MM PROTECTION SLEEVE 188MM. IT WAS UNKNOWN WHEN THE SLEEVE BECAME BENT HOWEVER THE DEVICE WAS STILL UTILIZED IN SURGERY. DURING THE SURGERY THE BENT 11.0MM/8.0MM PROTECTION SLEEVE 188MM BECAME LOCKED WITH AN 8.0MM/4.2MM DRILL SLEEVE 200MM. THE SURGERY WAS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY WITHOUT ANY REPORTED DELAYS OR ILL-AFFECTS SUFFERED BY THE PATIENT. THERE IS NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AT THIS TIME. THIS IS REPORT 1 OF 1 FOR (B)(4). DEVICE INVESTIGATION SUMMARY ? THE COMPLAINT CONDITION FOR THE 03.025.040 (LOT: 9096896) 11.0MM/8.0MM PROTECTION SLEEVE WAS LIKELY CAUSED BY ROUGH HANDLING DURING SURGERY OR STERILE PROCESSING; HOWEVER, THIS COMPLAINT IS NOT LIKELY A RESULT OF ANY DESIGN RELATED DEFICIENCY. THE 03.025.040 11.0MM/8.0MM PROTECTION SLEEVE IS ROUTINELY USED IN THE ANGULAR STABLE LOCKING SYSTEM. THE 03.025.040 PROTECTION SLEEVE WAS RETURNED AND REPORTED TO HAVE BECOME LOCKED TOGETHER WITH THE DRILL SLEEVE. THIS CONDITION IS CONFIRMED; THE DISTAL LIP OF THE PROTECTION SLEEVE HAS BECOME FLATTENED AND BEGUN TO OCCLUDE THE OPENING OF THE SLEEVE. THIS PREVENTS THE MATING DRILL SLEEVE FROM PASSING THROUGH THE OPENING, CAUSING THE DEVICES TO LOCK TOGETHER. IT IS LIKELY THAT ROUGH HANDLING DURING SURGERY OR STERILE PROCESSING HAS LED TO THIS COMPLAINT CONDITION. THE DEVICE WAS MANUFACTURED IN 9/2014 AND IS OVER ONE YEAR OLD. THE BALANCE OF THE RETURNED DEVICE IS IN OTHERWISE FAIRLY GOOD CONDITION WITH ONLY SOME MILD WEAR AT THE PROXIMAL END. THE DEVICE DRAWING WAS REVIEWED AND DETERMINED TO BE SUITABLE FOR THE INTENDED DESIGN, APPLICATION AND DIMENSIONAL CONFORMITY WHEN USED AS RECOMMENDED. DEVICE WAS USED FOR TREATMENT, NOT DIAGNOSIS. IF INFORMATION IS OBTAINED THAT WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE INITIAL MEDWATCH, A FOLLOW-UP MEDWATCH WILL BE FILED AS APPROPRIATE.|1059

THIS FREEDOM HOSPITAL AC POWER SUPPLY WAS NOT IN PATIENT USE. THE FREEDOM HOSPITAL AC POWER SUPPLY IS A COMPONENT THAT ENABLES THE FREEDOM DRIVER TO BE PLUGGED INTO AN EXTERNAL POWER SOURCE. THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT THE GREEN CONNECTOR DID NOT FIT IN THE FREEDOM POWER ADAPTORS. THE HOSPITAL AC POWER SUPPLY WAS RETURNED TO SYNCARDIA FOR EVALUATION. VISUAL INSPECTION REVEALED THAT THE CABLE CONNECTOR COVER WAS NOT IN THE CORRECT ORIENTATION. THIS PREVENTED THE HOSPITAL AC POWER SUPPLY FROM MAKING A PROPER CONNECTION TO PROVIDE POWER TO A FREEDOM POWER ADAPTOR OR BATTERY CHARGER. THE HOSPITAL AC POWER SUPPLY CABLE WAS DISASSEMBLED, THE CONNECTOR KEY SLOT WAS ALIGNED WITH THE CONNECTOR COVER KEY TAB AND THE CORRECT MATING CONFIGURATION WAS OBTAINED. AFTER THE HOSPITAL AC POWER SUPPLY CABLE WAS REASSEMBLED, THE HOSPITAL AC POWER SUPPLY PASSED ALL REQUIRED FUNCTIONAL TESTING. THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE OBSERVED ISSUE WAS THE INCORRECT ORIENTATION OF THE CONNECTOR COVER ON THE FREEDOM HOSPITAL AC POWER SUPPLY, WHICH MAY RESULT FROM PROCESSES AT THE COMPONENT SUPPLIER OR SYNCARDIA. SYNCARDIA HAS IMPLEMENTED PROCESS CONTROLS TO IDENTIFY THIS ISSUE PRIOR TO RELEASE OF FREEDOM HOSPITAL AC POWER SUPPLIES TO FINISHED GOODS AND TO ELIMINATE THE POTENTIAL FOR RECURRENCE. THE OCCURRENCE RATE FOR THIS ISSUE IS REMOTE AND THERE IS NO IMPACT TO THE PATIENT. THE INCORRECT ORIENTATION OF THE CONNECTOR COVER IS IMMEDIATELY IDENTIFIABLE BY HOSPITAL PERSONNEL WHEN PREPARING THE FREEDOM DRIVER FOR PATIENT USE PER SECTION 7.5 OF F-900012, FREEDOM DRIVER SYSTEM OPERATOR MANUAL. THE FREEDOM DRIVER SYSTEM INCLUDES MULTIPLE POWER SOURCES AND POWER SUPPLY ACCESSORIES SUCH THAT OPERATION OF THE DRIVER IS NOT IMPACTED BY THIS ISSUE. THIS ISSUE WILL CONTINUE TO BE MONITORED AND TRENDED AS PART OF THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE PROCESS. SYNCARDIA HAS COMPLETED ITS EVALUATION OF THIS COMPLAINT AND IS CLOSING THIS FILE. THIS FREEDOM AC POWER SUPPLY WAS NOT IN PATIENT USE. THE FREEDOM AC POWER SUPPLY IS A COMPONENT THAT ENABLES THE FREEDOM DRIVER TO BE PLUGGED INTO AN EXTERNAL POWER SOURCE. THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT THE GREEN CONNECTOR WILL NOT FIT THE FREEDOM POWER ADAPTORS. THIS ALLEGED FAILURE MODE POSES A LOW RISK TO A PATIENT BECAUSE THIS ISSUE WAS OBSERVED WHEN THE FREEDOM AC POWER SUPPLY WAS NOT IN USE BY A PATIENT. IN ADDITION, THE REPORTED ISSUE WOULD NOT PREVENT THE FREEDOM DRIVER FROM PERFORMING ITS LIFE-SUSTAINING FUNCTIONS. THE FREEDOM DRIVER HAS A REDUNDANT POWER SOURCE OF ONBOARD BATTERIES. THE FREEDOM AC POWER SUPPLY WILL BE RETURNED TO SYNCARDIA FOR EVALUATION. THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION WILL BE PROVIDED IN A FOLLOW-UP MDR.|3049
THE FREEDOM DRIVER WAS RETURNED TO SYNCARDIA FOR EVALUATION. REVIEW OF THE ALARM HISTORY (EEPROM) REVEALED THREE PERMANENT FAULT ALARMS. ONE OF THE ALARMS, FAULT CODE 36, CAN BE PRODUCED DURING BATTERY EXCHANGE WHILE OPERATING THE FREEDOM DRIVER ONLY ON BATTERY POWER. THE DRIVER PASSED ALL TEST REQUIREMENTS, WHICH INCLUDED NOMINAL NORMOTENSIVE AND HYPERTENSIVE SETTINGS WITH NO ANOMALIES OR ALARMS. AN ONBOARD BATTERY EXCHANGE TEST WAS CONDUCTED USING TEST BATTERIES, AS THE BATTERIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ISSUE WERE NOT RETURNED WITH THE DRIVER. DURING THE TEST, THE DRIVER PERFORMED AS INTENDED WITH NO EVIDENCE OF A DEVICE MALFUNCTION. THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE COULD NOT BE REPRODUCED, BUT IT WAS CONFIRMED BY THE ALARMS RECORDED IN THE EEPROM. THE ROOT CAUSE FOR THE CUSTOMER-REPORTED ISSUE COULD NOT BE DETERMINED. THIS ISSUE WILL CONTINUE TO BE MONITORED AND TRENDED AS PART OF THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE PROCESS. SYNCARDIA HAS COMPLETED ITS EVALUATION OF THIS COMPLAINT AND IS CLOSING THIS FILE. (B)(4). THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT THE FREEDOM DRIVER EXHIBITED AN IRREVERSIBLE FAULT ALARM WHILE THE PATIENT WAS CHANGING OUT TO TWO FULLY CHARGED ONBOARD BATTERIES IN A VEHICLE. THE CUSTOMER ALSO REPORTED THAT THE FAULT ALARM OCCURRED AFTER THE SECOND ONBOARD BATTERY WAS INSERTED INTO THE FREEDOM DRIVER. THE CUSTOMER ALSO REPORTED THAT THE FREEDOM DRIVER CONTINUED TO EXHIBIT AN IRREVERSIBLE FAULT ALARM AFTER THE PATIENT ATTEMPTED TO CHANGE TO ANOTHER SET OF ONBOARD BATTERIES AND CONNECT THE DRIVER TO THE CAR POWER OUTLET. THE CUSTOMER ALSO REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY SWITCHED TO THE BACKUP FREEDOM DRIVER. THE HOSPITAL STAFF MEMBER NOTICED THAT THERE WERE STILL 3 BARS OF POWER ON THE RETURNED ONBOARD BATTERIES. THERE WAS NO REPORTED ADVERSE PATIENT IMPACT. THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT THE FREEDOM DRIVER EXHIBITED AN IRREVERSIBLE FAULT ALARM WHILE THE PATIENT WAS CHANGING OUT TO TWO FULLY CHARGED ONBOARD BATTERIES IN A VEHICLE.

THE CIRCULATORY SUPPORT SYSTEM (CSS) CONSOLE WAS NOT IN USE BY A PATIENT. THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT THE BACKUP BATTERY TEST DID NOT PASS DURING THE CONSOLE CHECKOUT AND THE ALARM PANEL BATTERY DISCHARGE LIGHT TURNED RED. THE CSS CONSOLE WAS RETURNED TO SYNCARDIA FOR EVALUATION. THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE RELATING TO THE INABILITY OF THE CSS CONSOLE TO PASS THE BACKUP BATTERY TEST OF THE CONSOLE CHECKOUT PROCEDURE WAS REPRODUCED AT SYNCARDIA. THE CSS CONSOLE FAILED THE BACKUP BATTERY TEST. WHILE DEPRESSING THE BATTERY TEST BUTTON ON THE ALARM PANEL FOR 10 SECONDS, THE INDICATOR LIGHT FLASHED FROM GREEN TO RED AFTER TWO SECONDS. THE ROOT CAUSE WAS THAT THE CSS CONSOLE BACKUP BATTERIES COULD NO LONGER HOLD A CHARGE. THIS HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY OBSERVED AND DOCUMENTED UNDER A SEPARATE INVESTIGATION, WHICH CONCLUDED THAT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE REDUCED CAPACITY FOR THESE BATTERIES WAS THE RESULT OF SULFATION OF THE BATTERY CELLS THAT CAN OCCUR IF THE CONSOLE IS LEFT UNPLUGGED FOR AN EXTENDED AMOUNT OF TIME, IF THE CONSOLE IS STORED WITH A LOW BATTERY CHARGE, OR IF THE BATTERIES WERE DISCHARGED TO ZERO VOLTS. CSS CONSOLE BATTERIES ARE CONSUMABLE ITEMS AND WERE REPLACED. AFTER REPLACING THE BATTERIES, THE CSS CONSOLE SUCCESSFULLY PASSED ALL TESTING. THE FAILURE MODE POSES A LOW RISK TO A PATIENT BECAUSE THE CSS CONSOLE WAS NOT IN PATIENT USE AT THE TIME OF THE CUSTOMER-REPORTED ISSUE, AND IT WOULD NOT PREVENT THE CSS CONSOLE FROM PERFORMING ITS LIFE-SUSTAINING FUNCTIONS. THE CONSOLE IS DESIGNED TO BE CONNECTED TO AC POWER AND TURNED ON AT ALL TIMES. IN THE EVENT THAT THE CONSOLE IS DISCONNECTED FROM AC POWER, THE CONSOLE'S BACKUP BATTERIES WILL MAINTAIN POWER FOR THE CSS CONSOLE. THE CSS CONSOLE WAS SERVICED PRIOR TO BEING PLACED INTO FINISHED GOODS. THIS ISSUE WILL CONTINUE TO BE MONITORED AND TRENDED AS PART OF THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE PROCESS. SYNCARDIA HAS COMPLETED ITS EVALUATION OF THIS COMPLAINT AND IS CLOSING THIS FILE. THE CIRCULATORY SUPPORT SYSTEM (CSS) CONSOLE WAS NOT IN USE BY A PATIENT. THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT THE ALARM PANEL BATTERY DISCHARGE LIGHT TURNED RED. THIS ALLEGED FAILURE MODE POSES A LOW RISK TO A PATIENT BECAUSE THE ISSUE WAS OBSERVED WHEN THE CSS CONSOLE WAS NOT SUPPORTING A PATIENT. IN ADDITION, IT WOULD NOT PREVENT THE CSS CONSOLE FROM PERFORMING ITS LIFE-SUSTAINING FUNCTIONS. THE CSS CONSOLE WILL BE RETURNED TO SYNCARDIA FOR EVALUATION. THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION WILL BE PROVIDED IN A FOLLOW-UP MDR.|2913
SYSTEM UPDATES PENDING. RESULT: KNOWN INHERENT RISK OF PROCEDURE. PER THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU) CARDIOVASCULAR INJURY, SUCH AS PERFORATION DISSECTION OF VESSELS, VENTRICLE, MYOCARDIUM OR VALVULAR STRUCTURES, IS A KNOWN POTENTIAL COMPLICATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE TAVR PROCEDURE. ACCORDING TO THE THV TRAINING MANUALS, RISK FACTORS FOR AORTIC DISSECTION, HEMATOMA OR ANNULAR RUPTURE DURING THE TAVR PROCEDURE INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT THV OVER SIZING, SEVERELY OBLITERATED SINUSES OF VALSALVA, PORCELAIN AORTA AND/OR PRESENCE OF BULKY CALCIFICATION AND NARROW CALCIFIED STJ. IN ADDITION, ADVANCED AGE, FEMALE GENDER, SMALL BODY WEIGHT, AND STEROID DEPENDENCY CAN ALSO BE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS. THE SAPIEN VALVE RELIES ON NATIVE VALVE CALCIUM TO SECURELY ANCHOR TO THE ANNULUS. DESPITE THIS BENEFICIAL ASPECT OF CALCIUM, BULKY CALCIUM CAN INCREASE THE RISK OF CALCIFIC NODULE DISPLACEMENT INTO THE VASCULATURE, WHICH CAN LEAD TO VASCULAR INJURY. AT TIMES THE EXTENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF CALCIUM CAN IMPAIR EASE OF DELIVERY OF THE VALVE, CORRECT POSITIONING OF THE VALVE, DEPLOYMENT OF THE VALVE AND PROCEDURAL SUCCESS. IN THIS CASE, IN ADDITION TO THE PROCEDURE ITSELF, PATIENT FACTORS (SEVERE ANNULAR CALCIFICATION, SEVERE NATIVE LEAFLET CALCIFICATION) LIKELY CONTRIBUTED TO THIS EVENT. THE IFU AND TRAINING MANUALS HAVE BEEN REVIEWED AND NO INADEQUACIES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED WITH REGARDS TO WARNINGS, CONTRAINDICATIONS, AND THE DIRECTIONS/C ONDITIONS FOR THE SUCCESSFUL USE OF THE DEVICE. COMPLAINT HISTORIES FOR ALL REPORTED EVENTS ARE REVIEWED AGAINST TRENDING CONTROL LIMITS ON A MONTHLY BASIS, AND ANY EXCURSIONS ABOVE THE CONTROL LIMITS ARE ASSESSED AND DOCUMENTED AS PART OF THIS MONTHLY REVIEW. NO CORRECTIVE OR PREVENTATIVE ACTIONS ARE REQUIRED. AS REPORTED BY OUR EDWARDS EUROPEAN AFFILIATE, DURING A TRANSAORTIC TAVR PROCEDURE, FOLLOWING DEPLOYMENT OF A 29MM SAPIEN 3 VALVE IN A FINAL 70:30 AORTIC/VENTRICULAR (A/V) POSITION, AN ANNULAR RUPTURE WAS OBSERVED. THE PATIENT WAS CONVERTED TO OPEN SURGERY TO REPAIR THE RUPTURE. THE SAPIEN 3 VALVE REMAINS IMPLANTED IN THE PATIENT. THE ANNULAR DIAMETER MEASURED 25MM BY TEE WITH A VALVE AREA OF 695MM2 BY CT. SEVERE ANNULAR CALCIFICATION, SEVERE NATIVE LEAFLET CALCIFICATION AND MILD AORTIC ROOT CALCIFICATION WAS REPORTED.|527
(B)(4). PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS A CORRECTED REPORT. THE INITIAL REPORTER WAS CHANGED FROM (B)(6) AT SYNCARDIA, TO (B)(6). THIS FREEDOM AC POWER SUPPLY WAS NOT IN PATIENT USE. THE FREEDOM AC POWER SUPPLY IS A COMPONENT THAT ENABLES THE FREEDOM DRIVER TO BE PLUGGED INTO AN EXTERNAL POWER SOURCE. THE SYNCARDIA CLINICAL SUPPORT SPECIALIST REPORTED THAT THE GREEN CONNECTOR OF THE FREEDOM AC POWER SUPPLY WAS DIFFICULT TO INSERT AND DOES NOT SECURELY CONNECT INTO THE FREEDOM POWER ADAPTOR. THE HOSPITAL FREEDOM AC POWER SUPPLY WAS RETURNED TO SYNCARDIA FOR EVALUATION. VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE FREEDOM HOSPITAL AC POWER SUPPLY REVEALED THAT THE CABLE CONNECTOR COVER WAS IN THE INCORRECT ORIENTATION. THIS IS THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE CUSTOMER-REPORTED HOSPITAL AC POWER SUPPLY'S INABILITY TO CONNECT TO A FREEDOM POWER ADAPTOR AND/OR BATTERY CHARGER. THE CUSTOMER REPORTED ISSUE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE RESULT OF THE CABLE CONNECTOR COVER BEING INSTALLED INCORRECTLY AT SYNCARDIA DURING INCOMING INSPECTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH SYNCARDIA'S INCOMING INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS. DURING INCOMING INSPECTION AT SYNCARDIA, INSPECTORS PERFORM A VERIFICATION TO ENSURE THAT THE CONNECTOR'S INTERIOR THREADS ARE PROPERLY MATED WITH ADHESIVE. THE VERIFICATION REQUIRES INSPECTORS TO REMOVE THE CONNECTOR COVER. THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN ADDRESSED AND INCOMING INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS WERE IMPROVED TO CLEARLY IDENTIFY THE CORRECT REMOVAL AND REPLACEMENT OF THE CONNECTOR COVER. THIS FAILURE MODE POSES A LOW RISK TO A PATIENT BECAUSE THE FREEDOM HOSPITAL AC POWER SUPPLY WAS NOT IN USE BY A PATIENT AT THE TIME OF THE CUSTOMER-REPORTED ISSUE. IN ADDITION, IT WOULD NOT PREVENT A FREEDOM DRIVER FROM PERFORMING ITS LIFE-SUSTAINING FUNCTIONS. THE FREEDOM DRIVER IS EQUIPPED WITH REDUNDANT POWER SOURCES, INCLUDING MULTIPLE RECHARGEABLE FREEDOM ONBOARD BATTERIES AND A BACKUP AC POWER SUPPLY. THE HOSPITAL AC POWER SUPPLY CABLE WAS DISASSEMBLED, THE CONNECTOR KEY SLOT WAS ALIGNED WITH THE CONNECTOR COVER KEY TAB AND THE CORRECT MATING CONFIGURATION WAS OBTAINED. AFTER THE HOSPITAL AC POWER SUPPLY CABLE WAS REASSEMBLED, THE AC POWER SUPPLY PASSED ALL REQUIRED FUNCTIONAL TESTING. BECAUSE THE FREEDOM HOSPITAL AC POWER SUPPLY MET ALL REQUIRED ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA, THE UNIT WAS RETURNED TO INVENTORY. THIS ISSUE WILL CONTINUE TO BE MONITORED AND TRENDED AS PART OF THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE PROCESS. SYNCARDIA HAS COMPLETED ITS EVALUATION OF THIS COMPLAINT AND IS CLOSING THIS FILE.|498
THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT THE COMPANION 2 DRIVER EXHIBITED A SYSTEM MALFUNCTION ALARM WHILE THE PATIENT WAS GETTING INTO THE HOSPITAL ELEVATOR. THE CUSTOMER ALSO REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY SWITCHED TO THE BACKUP COMPANION 2 DRIVER. THERE WAS NO REPORTED ADVERSE PATIENT IMPACT. THE COMPANION 2 DRIVER WAS RETURNED TO SYNCARDIA FOR EVALUATION. VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE DRIVER'S EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL COMPONENTS REVEALED NO ANOMALIES. THE SYSTEM MALFUNCTION ALARM OBSERVED BY THE CUSTOMER WAS CONFIRMED THROUGH A REVIEW OF THE PATIENT FILE. ATTEMPTS TO DUPLICATE THE SYSTEM MALFUNCTION ALARM WERE UNSUCCESSFUL THROUGH NORMAL AND SIMULATED OPERATION OF THE DRIVER. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE CUSTOMER-REPORTED SYSTEM MALFUNCTION ALARM COULD NOT BE DETERMINED, AND THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF A DEVICE MALFUNCTION. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE KEY SWITCH MAY HAVE BEEN BUMPED AND MOVED OUT OF POSITION LONG ENOUGH TO RESULT IN THE SYSTEM MALFUNCTION ALARM. DURING TESTING, THE SYSTEM MALFUNCTION ALARM COULD ONLY BE GENERATED THROUGH MANIPULATION OF THE KEY SWITCH. ALTHOUGH THE DRIVER WAS SUPPORTING A PATIENT AT THE TIME OF THE SYSTEM MALFUNCTION ALARM, THE RISK TO THE PATIENT WAS LOW BECAUSE THE SYSTEM MALFUNCTION ALARM DID NOT PREVENT THE DRIVER FROM PERFORMING ITS LIFE-SUSTAINING FUNCTIONS. THERE WAS NO CHANGE TO THE PUMPING OF THE DRIVER OR TO THE PATIENT'S CONDITION. THE COMPANION 2 DRIVER WAS SERVICED AND PASSED ALL FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE TESTING BEFORE BEING PLACED INTO FINISHED GOODS. THIS ISSUE WILL CONTINUE TO BE MONITORED AND TRENDED AS PART OF THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE PROCESS. SYNCARDIA HAS COMPLETED ITS EVALUATION OF THIS COMPLAINT AND IS CLOSING THIS FILE. THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT THE COMPANION 2 DRIVER EXHIBITED A SYSTEM MALFUNCTION ALARM WHILE THE PATIENT WAS GETTING INTO THE HOSPITAL ELEVATOR. THE CUSTOMER ALSO REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY SWITCHED TO THE BACKUP COMPANION 2 DRIVER. THERE WAS NO REPORTED ADVERSE PATIENT IMPACT. THIS ALLEGED FAILURE MODE POSES A LOW RISK TO THE PATIENT BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THE COMPANION 2 DRIVER EXHIBITED A SYSTEM MALFUNCTION ALARM, THE COMPANION 2 DRIVER CONTINUED TO PERFORM ITS LIFE-SUSTAINING FUNCTIONS. THE COMPANION 2 DRIVER WILL BE RETURNED TO SYNCARDIA FOR EVALUATION. THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION WILL BE PROVIDED IN A FOLLOW-UP MDR.|1012

THE CUSTOMER ALSO REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY SWITCHED TO THE BACKUP FREEDOM DRIVER S/N (B)(4). THE DRIVER S/N (B)(4) READINGS WERE AS FOLLOWS: BR 130, FV 51.2, AND CO 7.1. THE CUSTOMER ALSO REPORTED THAT THE BACKUP FREEDOM DRIVER S/N (B)(4) EXHIBITED AN IRREVERSIBLE FAULT ALARM AFTER THE PATIENT HAD ANOTHER COUGHING EPISODE. THE CUSTOMER ALSO REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT WAS INSTRUCTED BY THE HOSPITAL TO RETURN TO THE PRIMARY FREEDOM DRIVER S/N (B)(4) AFTER THE HOSPITAL STAFF CONFIRMED THE DRIVER WAS FUNCTIONING NORMALLY. THE CUSTOMER ALSO REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT ARRIVED AT THE HOSPITAL WHERE THE HOSPITAL STAFF CONFIRMED THE PATIENT WAS STABLE AND THE DRIVER AND CANNULAE WERE INTACT AND HAD NO ISSUES. THE CUSTOMER ALSO REPORTED THAT THE PRIMARY FREEDOM DRIVER S/N (B)(4) EXHIBITED ANOTHER FAULT ALARM WHEN THE PATIENT WAS INSTRUCTED TO COUGH. THE CUSTOMER ALSO REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY SWITCHED TO ANOTHER BACKUP FREEDOM DRIVER. THERE WAS NO REPORTED ADVERSE PATIENT IMPACT. THIS ALLEGED FAILURE MODE POSES A LOW RISK TO THE PATIENT BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THE FREEDOM DRIVER EXHIBITED FAULT ALARMS, THE FREEDOM DRIVER CONTINUED TO PERFORM ITS LIFE-SUSTAINING FUNCTIONS. THE FREEDOM DRIVER S/N (B)(4) AND S/N (B)(4) WILL BE RETURNED TO SYNCARDIA FOR EVALUATION. THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION WILL BE PROVIDED IN A FOLLOW-UP MDR. THE FREEDOM DRIVER WAS RETURNED TO SYNCARDIA FOR EVALUATION. VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE INTERNAL COMPONENTS OF THE DRIVER REVEALED THE CAM FOLLOWER ON THE SECONDARY MOTOR OUT OF BOTTOM DEAD CENTER (BDC) POSITION. REVIEW OF THE ELECTRONIC DATA REVEALED TWO PERMANENT ALARMS, FAULT CODE 2D, WHICH CORRESPONDS TO A ""SECONDARY MOTOR VOLTAGE TOO HIGH"" FAULT CONDITION. THIS FAULT CONDITION WAS CONFIRMED THROUGH INVESTIGATION TESTING AND THE OBSERVATION OF THE CAM FOLLOWER ON THE SECONDARY MOTOR OUT OF BDC POSITION, WHICH IS INDICATIVE OF AN OPERATION SWITCH TO THE SECONDARY MOTOR. THE DRIVER IN ""AS RECEIVED"" CONDITION PASSED ALL TEST REQUIREMENTS, WHILE OPERATING ON THE PRIMARY MOTOR, WITH NO ANOMALIES OR UNINTENDED ALARMS. THE CUSTOMER-REPORTED ISSUE WAS NOT REPRODUCED DURING INCOMING INSPECTION TESTING. BECAUSE THE INTERNAL VISUAL INSPECTION REVEALED THE CAM FOLLOWER ON THE SECONDARY MOTOR WAS OUT OF BDC POSITION, THE DRIVER WAS ALSO TESTED ON THE SECONDARY MOTOR AND EXHIBITED AN ALARM, AS EXPECTED. DESPITE THE FAULT ALARM, THE DRIVER PASSED ALL TEST REQUIREMENTS WITH NO ANOMALIES. THE CUSTOMER-REPORTED FAULT ALARM WAS REPRODUCED ONLY AS A RESULT OF A DELIBERATE OPERATION SWITCH TO THE SECONDARY MOTOR. DESPITE THE CUSTOMER-REPORTED FAULT ALARM, THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF A DEVICE MALFUNCTION. THE DRIVER EXPERIENCED A FAULT ALARM AS A RESULT OF AN OPERATION SWITCH TO THE SECONDARY MOTOR AS INDICATED BY THE CAM FOLLOWER ON THE SECONDARY MOTOR BEING OUT OF BOTTOM DEAD CENTER POSITION. ALTHOUGH IT COULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE PATIENT CONDITIONS (FORCEFUL COUGHING) AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT, THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE TO CONCLUSIVELY DETERMINE WHY THE DRIVER SWITCHED OPERATION TO THE SECONDARY MOTOR. THIS ISSUE WILL CONTINUE TO BE MONITORED AND TRENDED AS PART OF THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE PROCESS. SYNCARDIA HAS COMPLETED ITS EVALUATION OF THIS COMPLAINT AND IS CLOSING THIS FILE. (B)(4)."|405
DEVICE WAS USED FOR TREATMENT, NOT DIAGNOSIS. A PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT INVESTIGATION WAS PERFORMED FOR THE SUBJECT DEVICE (8.5MM MEDULLARY REAMER HEAD, PART NUMBER 352.085, LOT 20141).

THE CUSTOMER ALSO REPORTED THAT THE PRIMARY FREEDOM DRIVER S/N (B)(4) EXHIBITED ANOTHER FAULT ALARM WHEN THE PATIENT WAS INSTRUCTED TO COUGH. THE CUSTOMER ALSO REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY SWITCHED TO ANOTHER BACKUP FREEDOM DRIVER. THERE WAS NO REPORTED ADVERSE PATIENT IMPACT. THIS ALLEGED FAILURE MODE POSES A LOW RISK TO THE PATIENT BECAUSE ALTHOUGH THE FREEDOM DRIVER EXHIBITED FAULT ALARMS, THE FREEDOM DRIVER CONTINUED TO PERFORM ITS LIFE-SUSTAINING FUNCTIONS. THE FREEDOM DRIVER S/N (B)(4) AND S/N (B)(4) WILL BE RETURNED TO SYNCARDIA FOR EVALUATION. THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION WILL BE PROVIDED IN A FOLLOW-UP MDR. THE FREEDOM DRIVER WAS RETURNED TO SYNCARDIA FOR EVALUATION. VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE INTERNAL COMPONENTS OF THE DRIVER REVEALED THE CAM FOLLOWER ON THE SECONDARY MOTOR OUT OF BOTTOM DEAD CENTER (BDC) POSITION. REVIEW OF THE ELECTRONIC DATA REVEALED FOUR PERMANENT ALARMS, FAULT CODE 2D, WHICH CORRESPONDS TO A ""SECONDARY MOTOR VOLTAGE TOO HIGH"" FAULT CONDITION. THIS FAULT CONDITION WAS CONFIRMED THROUGH INVESTIGATION TESTING AND THE OBSERVATION OF THE CAM FOLLOWER ON THE SECONDARY MOTOR OUT OF BDC POSITION, WHICH IS INDICATIVE OF AN OPERATION SWITCH TO THE SECONDARY MOTOR. THE DRIVER IN ""AS RECEIVED"" CONDITION PASSED ALL TEST REQUIREMENTS, WHILE OPERATING ON THE PRIMARY MOTOR, WITH NO ANOMALIES OR UNINTENDED ALARMS. THE CUSTOMER-REPORTED ISSUE WAS NOT REPRODUCED DURING INCOMING INSPECTION TESTING. BECAUSE THE INTERNAL VISUAL INSPECTION REVEALED THE CAM FOLLOWER ON THE SECONDARY MOTOR WAS OUT OF BDC POSITION, THE DRIVER WAS ALSO TESTED ON THE SECONDARY MOTOR AND EXHIBITED AN ALARM, AS EXPECTED. DESPITE THE FAULT ALARM, THE DRIVER PASSED ALL TEST REQUIREMENTS WITH NO ANOMALIES. THE CUSTOMER-REPORTED FAULT ALARM WAS REPRODUCED ONLY AS A RESULT OF A DELIBERATE OPERATION SWITCH TO THE SECONDARY MOTOR. DESPITE THE CUSTOMER-REPORTED FAULT ALARM, THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF A DEVICE MALFUNCTION. THE DRIVER EXPERIENCED A FAULT ALARM AS A RESULT OF AN OPERATION SWITCH TO THE SECONDARY MOTOR AS INDICATED BY THE CAM FOLLOWER ON THE SECONDARY MOTOR BEING OUT OF BOTTOM DEAD CENTER POSITION. ALTHOUGH IT COULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE PATIENT CONDITIONS (FORCEFUL COUGHING) AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT, THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE TO CONCLUSIVELY DETERMINE WHY THE DRIVER SWITCHED OPERATION TO THE SECONDARY MOTOR. THIS ISSUE WILL CONTINUE TO BE MONITORED AND TRENDED AS PART OF THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE PROCESS. SYNCARDIA HAS COMPLETED ITS EVALUATION OF THIS COMPLAINT AND IS CLOSING THIS FILE. (B)(4) FOLLOW-UP REPORT 1."|2591

FOLLOW-UP #1: DATE OF SUBMISSION 01/27/2016 DEVICE EVALUATION: THE PUMP HAS BEEN RETURNED AND EVALUATED BY PRODUCT ANALYSIS ON 01/15/2016 WITH THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS: DURING TESTING, THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT WAS OBSERVED TO BE CRACKED IN TWO PLACES.|1135
AS REPORTED BY OUR EDWARDS AFFILIATE IN (B)(4), DURING A TRANSFEMORAL TAVR PROCEDURE, AN ACCESS VESSEL DISSECTION WAS OBSERVED. A VASCULAR GRAFT WAS USED TO REPAIR THE DISSECTION. DURING THE PROCEDURE, PERCUTANEOUS ACCESS WAS OBTAINED IN THE RIGHT FEMORAL ARTERY. A 16FR DILATOR AND A 16FR ESHEATH WERE INSERTED WITHOUT RESISTANCE. UPON INSERTION OF A NOVAFLEX+ DELIVERY SYSTEM, SIGNIFICANT RESISTANCE WAS ENCOUNTERED. A 23MM SAPIEN XT VALVE WAS SUCCESSFULLY POSITIONED AND DEPLOYED IN A FINAL 70:30 AORTIC/VENTRICULAR (A/V) POSITION. UPON WITHDRAWAL OF THE ESHEATH, ?MASSIVE? BLEEDING FROM THE ACCESS SITE WAS OBSERVED. DIGITAL SUBTRACTION ANGIOGRAPHY (DSA) INDICATED NO ABNORMALITIES. AN INTIMAL DETACHMENT WAS DISCOVERED ADHERED TO THE ESHEATH. AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO CLOSE THE ACCESS SITE WITH A PERCLOSE CLOSURE DEVICE, BUT IT WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL AND AN ADDITIONAL PERCLOSE WAS REQUIRED. ADDITIONALLY, AN ANGIO-SEAL WAS USED AND HEMOSTASIS WAS ACHIEVED. DSA WAS REPEATED AND IT SHOWED BLOOD FLOW DELAY WITH DISSECTION IN THE ACCESS SITE WHERE THE PERCLOSE WAS USED. A GUIDEWIRE WAS INSERTED FROM THE CONTRALATERAL SIDE INTO THE EXTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY (EIA) AND A BALLOON OCCLUSION WAS PERFORMED IN THE COMMON ILIAC ARTERY (CIA). THE ACCESS SITE WAS OPENED AND THE DISSECTION WAS REPAIRED USING ANGIOPLASTY. REPEAT DSA INDICATED ANOTHER DISSECTION IN THE MORE CENTRAL SIDE THAN THE REPAIRED SITE AND NO BLOOD FLOW WAS OBSERVED. AN EPIC STENT WAS PLACED FROM THE MORE CENTRAL SIDE TO THE DISSECTED SITE. FOLLOWING STENT PLACEMENT, DSA SHOWED BLOOD FLOW. A DIFFERENT DISSECTION WAS THEN OBSERVED BY DSA FURTHER PERIPHERAL OF THE STENT DISTALLY. AN ABDOMINAL PARARECTAL INCISION WAS PERFORMED AND THE AREA IMMEDIATELY BELOW THE BIFURCATION OF THE EIA AND INTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY (IIA) WAS OPENED. THE EPIC STENT WAS REMOVED AND A VASCULAR GRAFT REPLACEMENT WAS PERFORMED. DSA INDICATED BLOOD FLOW OF THE PERIPHERAL SIDE AND THE PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED. THE PATIENT RECEIVED MORE THAN TWO UNITS OF TRANSFUSED BLOOD DURING THE ACCESS VESSEL REPAIR. THE ACCESS VESSEL MINIMUM LUMINAL DIAMETER (MLD) MEASURED 5.5MM WITH NO CALCIFICATION AND NO TORTUOSITY REPORTED. RESULT: KNOWN INHERENT RISK OF PROCEDURE. ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU), CARDIOVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS, INCLUDING PERFORATION OR DISSECTION OF VESSELS WHICH MAY REQUIRE INTERVENTION, ARE POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSFEMORAL TRANSCATHETER AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT PROCEDURE. ACCORDING TO LITERATURE REVIEW, AND AS DOCUMENTED IN A CLINICAL TECHNICAL SUMMARY WRITTEN BY EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES, VASCULAR COMPLICATIONS ARE A WELL RECOGNIZED COMPLICATION OF THE TRANSFEMORAL TAVR PROCEDURE IN THIS ELDERLY POPULATION WITH MULTIPLE CO-MORBIDITIES. EDWARDS HAS REVIEWED MANY REPORTS, INCLUDING SCREENING DATA RECORDS AND SOURCE DOCUMENTATION OF VASCULAR COMPLICATIONS AND HAS FOUND THAT THE ROOT CAUSE IS TYPICALLY RELATED TO A COMBINATION OF VESSEL SIZE, TORTUOSITY AND CALCIFICATIONS. ALTHOUGH THE INCIDENCE IS DECREASING WITH SMALLER SHEATH/DELIVERY SYSTEM SIZES AND PHYSICIAN EXPERIENCE, THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE CASES IN WHICH VASCULAR COMPLICATIONS WILL OCCUR. THE THV PHYSICIAN TRAINING MANUALS INSTRUCT ON PROCEDURAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR SHEATH INSERTION WITH REGARDS TO PROPER SCREENING CRITICAL TO REDUCING VASCULAR COMPLICATIONS. THE TRAINING MANUAL INSTRUCTS THE OPERATOR ON PROPER SHEATH INSERTION AND WITHDRAWAL TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING PRE-DILATING THE VESSEL WITH THE EDWARDS DILATORS, AS NEEDED. IT ALSO NOTES THAT CALCIFICATION MAY REDUCE LUMEN DIAMETER AND LIMIT OR PREVENT TRANSFEMORAL PASSAGE OF THE DEVICES. THE IFU CONTRAINDICATES PATIENTS WITH ILIO-FEMORAL VESSEL CHARACTERISTICS THAT WOULD PRECLUDE SAFE PLACEMENT OF SHEATHS SUCH AS SEVERE OBSTRUCTIVE CALCIFICATION OR SEVERE TORTUOSITY. PRE-PROCEDURE SCREENING AND ASSESSMENT OF THE FEMORAL/ILIAC ARTERY INTERNAL DIAMETERS WILL ENABLE THE CLINICIAN TO DETERMINE IF THE SAPIEN VALVE CAN BE DELIVERED TRANSFEMORALLY. ASSESSMENT OF LOCATION AND AMOUNT OF CIRCUMFERENTIAL CALCIUM WILL AID IN DETERMINING AREAS OF REDUCED VESSEL DIAMETERS. THE OPERATORS ARE TRAINED TO MEASURE MINIMUM VESSEL DIAMETER TAKING CALCIUM INTO ACCOUNT. THE PHYSICIAN TRAINING MANUAL ALSO LISTS THE MINIMUM RECOMMENDED VESSEL SIZE FOR EACH SIZE DEVICE. DESPITE THE BEST SCREENING TOOLS, A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS WILL HAVE FEMORAL/ILIAC VESSELS THAT ARE NOT AMENABLE TO THE TRANS-FEMORAL APPROACH OR WHERE INCREASED RESISTANCE IS ENCOUNTERED DURING INSERTION OF DEVICES. IN MANY CASES, THE VESSEL MINIMUM LUMINAL DIAMETER (MLD) MAY BE BORDERLINE OR BELOW THE INDICATED SIZE. IN ADDITION, SIGNIFICANT CALCIFICATION AND/OR TORTUOSITY, NOT ALWAYS APPRECIABLE ON IMAGING, COULD BE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE EVENT. THE MINIMUM REQUIRED VESSEL DIAMETER FOR A 16FR ESHEATH IS 6.0MM. THE PATIENT?S ACCESS VESSEL MLD MEASURED 5.5MM WITH NO CALCIFICATION AND NO TORTUOSITY REPORTED. IN THIS CASE, PATIENT FACTORS (LESS THAN ADEQUATE ACCESS VESSEL MLD, CALCIFICATION AND/OR TORTUOSITY NOT APPRECIABLE ON IMAGING) LIKELY CONTRIBUTED TO THE ILIAC ARTERY DISSECTIONS. THE IFU AND TRAINING MANUALS HAVE BEEN REVIEWED AND NO INADEQUACIES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED WITH REGARDS TO WARNINGS, CONTRAINDICATIONS, AND THE DIRECTIONS/CONDITIONS FOR THE SUCCESSFUL USE OF THE DEVICE. COMPLAINT HISTORIES FOR ALL REPORTED EVENTS ARE REVIEWED AGAINST TRENDING CONTROL LIMITS ON A MONTHLY BASIS, AND ANY EXCURSIONS ABOVE THE CONTROL LIMITS ARE ASSESSED AND DOCUMENTED AS PART OF THIS MONTHLY REVIEW. NO CORRECTIVE OR PREVENTATIVE ACTIONS ARE REQUIRED AT THIS TIME.|3038
THE CUSTOMER ALLEGES THAT THE CATHETER WAS CLOGGED AND THE MEDICAL SOLUTION WOULD NOT GO THROUGH.A NEW CATHETER WAS USED WITHOUT ISSUE. NO PATIENT INJURY REPORTED. QN#(B)(4). THE CUSTOMER RETURNED ONE EPIDURAL CATHETER AND SNAPLOCK ADAPTER FOR INVESTIGATION. A VISUAL EXAM WAS PERFORMED AND NO ISSUES WERE OBSERVED WITH THE SNAPLOCK. THE CATHETER APPEARED TO BE USED AS BIOLOGICAL MATERIAL WAS PRESENT BETWEEN THE CATHETER COILS, ESPECIALLY AT THE DISTAL TIP WHICH APPEARED TO BE FILLED WITH DRIED BLOOD. ADHESIVE RESIDUE WAS PRESENT ON THE CATHETER BODY EXTERIOR. NO OTHER DEFECTS WERE OBSERVED. FUNCTIONAL TESTING WAS PERFORMED AND NO BLOCKAGES WERE FOUND. THE REPORTED COMPLAINT OF A BLOCKED EPIDURAL CATHETER WAS NOT CONFIRMED BASED UPON THE SAMPLE RECEIVED. THE RETURNED EPIDURAL CATHETER WAS FOUND TO HAVE BIOLOGICAL MATERIAL BETWEEN THE CATHETER COILS, ESPECIALLY AT THE DISTAL TIP; HOWEVER, THE PRESENCE OF THIS MATERIAL DID NOT PREVENT FLOW FROM BEING ESTABLISHED DURING A FUNCTIONAL EXAM. A DHR REVIEW WAS PERFORMED ON THE EPIDURAL CATHETER WITH NO EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST A MANUFACTURING RELATED CAUSE. THERE WERE NO FUNCTIONAL ISSUES FOUND WITH THE RETURNED SAMPLE. THE CUSTOMER ALLEGES THAT THE CATHETER WAS CLOGGED AND THE MEDICAL SOLUTION WOULD NOT GO THROUGH. A NEW CATHETER WAS USED WITHOUT ISSUE. NO PATIENT INJURY REPORTED. (B)(4). COMPLAINT VERIFICATION TESTING COULD NOT BE PERFORMED AS NO SAMPLE WAS RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS. A DEVICE HISTORY RECORD (DHR) REVIEW WAS PERFORMED ON THE EPIDURAL CATHETER WITH NO EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST A MANUFACTURING RELATED CAUSE. THEREFORE, THE POTENTIAL CAUSE OF DIFFICULTY INJECTING THROUGH THE EPIDURAL CATHETER COULD NOT BE DETERMINED BASED UPON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED AND WITHOUT A SAMPLE. IF THE SAMPLE IS RETURNED, A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED WITH INVESTIGATION RESULTS.|1094

IT WAS REPORTED THE PATIENT HAD A PROCEDURE ON (B)(6) 2012 WITH A BIFURCATED STENT GRAFT. SUBSEQUENTLY, UPON FOLLOW UP IT APPEARS THAT THE ENDURANT PROXIMAL EXTENSION IS IN ITS PROPER POSITION AT THE RENALS AND THE BIFURCATED STENT STRUCTURE HAS COMPLETELY EXPANDED OUTWARD FROM THE TOP OF THE MAIN BODY DOWN TO THE BIFURCATION. THE OPINION IS THAT THE ENTIRE GRAFT MATERIAL HAS COME APART DUE TO A TEAR THAT PROPAGATED IN A LINEAR FASHION FROM THE TOP DOWN ALLOWING THE ENDOSKELETON TO EXPAND BEYOND NORMAL PARAMETERS. THE PHYSICIAN FEELS THE BEST WAY TO FIX THIS IS WITH AN AUI AND FEM-FEM SINCE THE NECK APPEARS TO HAVE DILATED TO 36MM. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RECEIVED ON 2/26/2016: SECONDARY HAS NOT BEEN SCHEDULED AND THE PATIENT WILL BE CONTINUED TO BE MONITORED. BASED UPON THE CLINICAL ASSESSMENT THE REPORTED TYPE 3B ENDOLEAK CONFIRMED. THE DEVICE WAS NOT RETURNED FOR EVALUATION. THE MANUFACTURING EVALUATION DID NOT REVEAL ANY ISSUES OR DEVIATIONS THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE REPORTED EVENT. BASED UPON THE ROOT CAUSE IT IS INCONCLUSIVE, THERE IS NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION TO DETERMINE THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE TYPE 3B ENDOLEAK. POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTING FACTORS INCLUDE OFF LABEL USE AND PATIENT CONDITION WHICH INCLUDES CALCIFICATION AND THROMBUS OF AORTIC ARTERIES.

THE SURGEON NOTICED HUMERAL COMPONENTS WERE LOOSE DURING A DIAGNOSTIC ARTHROSCOPY, PERFORMED BECAUSE THE PATIENT HAD BEEN COMPLAINING OF PAIN. THE SURGEON THEN REMOVED THE LOOSE COMPONENTS AND REPLACED WITH A DIFFERENT IMPLANT FROM ANOTHER COMPANY. AFTER TALKING WITH THE SURGEON, HE SAID HE MIGHT HAVE UNDERSIZED THE HUMERAL STEM AND THE PATIENT WAS AN AVID WEIGHT LIFTER WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE FOR LOOSENING. IT WAS REPORTED NO PATIENT INJURY IS ALLEGED AND REVISION OR MEDICAL INTERVENTION WAS NOT REQUIRED (ALTHOUGH A REVISION PROCEDURE WAS PERFORMED).|2913
(B)(4). THE DEVICE WAS RECEIVED AND THE EVALUATION IS COMPLETE. DURING THE EVENT HISTORY LOG REVIEW, AN INCREASED INTRA-PERITONEAL VOLUME (IIPV) EVENT WAS IDENTIFIED.

DEVICES ANALYSIS: A BROKEN NCB PP PROXIMAL FEMUR PLATE RIGHT, 15 HOLES, WAS RETURNED FOR INVESTIGATION TOGETHER WITH 3 CANCELLOUS SCREWS, 7 CORTICAL SCREWS AND 11 LOCKING CAPS. THE PLATE FRACTURED IN THE CENTRAL HOLE OF THE FIRST (AFTER THE MIS INTERFACE) DIAGONAL 3-HOLE PATTERN. BOTH FRACTURE SITES SHOW LARGE POLISHED AREAS. THIS CAN BE CAUSED BY AN ABRASIVE MOVEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO FRACTURE SITES IN VIVO AND/OR BY HANDLING WITHIN AND AFTER PLATE REMOVAL. THE EXAMINABLE FRACTURE SITE SECTIONS SHOW CLEAR BEACH LINES INDICATING A FATIGUE FRACTURE OF THE PLATE. THE FRACTURE HAS ITS ORIGIN IN ON THE LATERAL SIDE OF THE PLATE AT THE INTERFACE WITH THE THREAD OF THE SCREW HOLE. THE FATIGUE FRACTURE PROGRESS DIAGONALLY TO THE OUTER CORNER OF THE PLATE ON THE SURFACE CLOSE TO BONE. THE POINT OF ORIGIN OF THE FRACTURE DOES NOT SHOW ANY VISIBLE MATERIAL DEFECT WHICH COULD HAVE TRIGGERED OR FAVORED THE FRACTURE. THE PLATE SURFACE SHOWS MANY SCRATCHES AND MARKS. THE LOCKING CAPS SHOW DEFORMATIONS OF THE HEX DRIVE. ONE OF THE NCB CORTICAL SCREWS SHOWS DAMAGES OF THE THREAD, THE OTHER SCREWS SHOW DAMAGE OF THE HEX DRIVE. REVIEW OF INTERNAL DOCUMENTS: INSPECTION PLAN WAS REVIEWED: THE SURFACE WAS VISUALLY INSPECTED AQL 2.5. THE SURGICAL TECHNIQUE NCB PERIPROSTHETIC FEMUR CONTAINS INFORMATION AND ILLUSTRATIONS ABOUT THE INDICATION, CONTRAINDICATION AND POSITIONING OF THE PLATE. THE FOLLOWING CONTRAINDICATIONS ARE LISTED: ALL CONCOMITANT DISEASES THAT MAY IMPAIR THE FIXATION OF THE IMPLANT AND/OR THE SUCCESS OF THE INTERVENTION. LACK OF BONE SUBSTANCE OR POOR BONE QUALITY WHICH MAKES STABLE SEATING OF THE IMPLANT IMPOSSIBLE. THE RAW MATERIAL CERTIFICATE FOR LOT: 2706168 WAS REVIEWED AND WAS FOUND TO BE CONFORMING TO THE SPECIFICATIONS.

LINE R-W-4.5.1.1.2: BREAKAGE OF IMPLANT -> DUE TO USER DEFINE INCORRECT PLACEMENT OF THE SPACERS AND PLATE. LINE R-W-4.5.1.1.3: BREAKAGE OF IMPLANT -> DUE TO USER PERFORM IMPROPER HANDLING OF THE PLATE DURING INSERTION. LINE R-W-4.5.2.1.1: BREAKAGE OF THE IMPLANT -> DUE TO TOO MANY BENDING CYCLES AT THE SAME SPOT OR USE OF NCB SCREW HOLES WHICH HAVE BEEN BENT. LINE R-W-4.6.1.1.1: BREAKAGE OF IMPLANT -> DUE TO WRONG/ INCOMPLETE INFORMATION ABOUT LIMITATION AND POSTOPERATIVE RESTRICTION. LINE R-W-4.6.1.1.2: BREAKAGE OF IMPLANT -> DUE TO PATIENT DO NOT FOLLOW THE POSTOPERATIVE PROTOCOL. COMPARISON TO INVESTIGATION RESULTS WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE AND JUSTIFICATION: LINE R-1.4.1: POSSIBLE -> IT IS UNKNOWN IF CABLE AND CABLE BUTTONS WERE USED AND IF THESE LED TO NOTCHING/FRETTING. LINE R-1.4.9: NOT POSSIBLE -> FOLLOWING DOCUMENTS CERTIFY THE DESIGN OF THE PLATE: FATIGUE STRENGTH EVALUATION OF A NCB PP PROX FEMUR PLATE CONSTRUCT (RESEARCH REPORT); ENGINEERING DESIGN RATIONALE FOR THE NCB PP DF PLATE (RESEARCH REPORT); ENGINEERING DESIGN RATIONALE FOR THE NCB CURVED FEMUR SHAFT PLATE (RESEARCH REPORT). ADDITIONALLY, ADN ADVERSE TREND DUE TO DESIGN WOULD HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. LINE R-2.2.3: NOT POSSIBLE -> NO CORROSION WAS OBSERVED ON THE IMPLANT. LINE R-W-4.2.1.1.2: NOT POSSIBLE -> THERE IS NO EVIDENCE FOR IMPLANTATION AGAINST CONTRAINDICATION. LINE R-W-4.3.1.1.1: POSSIBLE -> NO X-RAYS WERE AVAILABLE, THEREFORE CORRECT POSITIONING AND SIZE CANNOT BE PROVEN. LINE R-W-4.3.1.1.2: POSSIBLE -> NO X-RAYS WERE AVAILABLE, THEREFORE CORRECT POSITIONING AND SIZE CANNOT BE PROVEN. LINE R-W-4.5.1.1.1: POSSIBLE -> THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE PLATE WAS BENT FOR THE IMPLANTATION. BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE PLATE WAS EXPERIENCING A BENDING MOMENT DUE TO THE EXISTING ATROPHIC PSEUDOARTHROSIS (STILL AFTER 14 MONTHS IN VIVO). LINE R-W-4.5.1.1.2: POSSIBLE -> NO X-RAYS WERE AVAILABLE, THEREFORE CORRECT POSITIONING AND SIZE CANNOT BE PROVEN. LINE R-W-4.5.1.1.3: POSSIBLE -> IT IS UNKNOWN HOW THE PLATE WAS IMPLANTED AND IF THE IMPLANTATION FOLLOWED THE SURGICAL TECHNIQUE. LINE R-W-4.5.2.1.1: POSSIBLE -> THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE PLATE WAS BENT FOR THE IMPLANTATION. BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE PLATE WAS EXPERIENCING A BENDING MOMENT DUE TO THE EXISTING ATROPHIC PSEUDOARTHROSIS (STILL AFTER 14 MONTHS IN VIVO). LINE R-W-4.6.1.1.1: POSSIBLE -> NO INFORMATION AVAILABLE ABOUT THE POSTOPERATIVE PROCEDURE, THEREFORE THIS POINT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED. LINE R-W-4.6.1.1.2: POSSIBLE -> NO INFORMATION AVAILABLE ABOUT THE POSTOPERATIVE PROCEDURE, THEREFORE THIS POINT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED. ACCORDING TO THE PATIENT HISTORY, THE PLATE BROKE AFTER 1 YEAR AND 2 MONTHS IN VIVO. THIS WAS A PERIPROSTHETIC NCB PLATE AND IT IS UNKNOWN IF THE PATIENT HAS AN IMPLANTED PROSTHESIS (HIP OR KNEE). ADDITIONALLY, IT IS REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT HAS A HISTORY OF SCLEROTIC BONE (TREATED BY DECORTICATION/SPONGIOSA-TRANSPLANTATION UND BMP APPLICATION) BEFORE PLATE IMPLANTATION. IT IS ALSO REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT HAD STILL EXISTING ATROPHIC PSEUDOARTHROSIS WHEN THE NCB PP PLATE BROKE. SUMMARIZING, THE PLATE BROKE 1 YEAR AND 2 MONTHS AFTER IMPLANTATION WITH EXISTING PSEUDOARTHROSIS IN A PATIENT WITH HISTORY OF POOR BONE QUALITY. IT IS HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT THE PLATE BROKE AFTER 14 MONTHS IN VIVO DUE TO THE HIGH PLATE LOADING CAUSED BY BONE NON-UNION. BASED ON THE GIVEN INFORMATION AND THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION, WE WERE NOT ABLE TO IDENTIFY A SPECIFIC ROOT CAUSE FOR THIS ISSUE. THE NEED FOR CORRECTIVE MEASURES IS NOT INDICATED AND ZIMMER (B)(4) CONSIDERS THIS CASE AS CLOSED. (B)(4). IT WAS REPORTED, THAT THE PATIENT WAS IMPLANTED A NCB PP PROX FEM PLATE, R,15 H, L. 324MM.

"IT WAS REPORTED THAT BOTH NOTCHES OF THE LAG SCREW WERE BROKEN WHILE INSERTING. DHR REVIEW RESULTS: Z NAIL 10.5 X 85 LAG SCREW: REF: (B)(4); LOT: 2804998; YIELD: (B)(4); DELIVERED: (B)(4); THE DEVICE MANUFACTURING QUALITY RECORDS INDICATE THAT THE RELEASED COMPONENTS MET ALL REQUIREMENTS TO PERFORM AS INTENDED. NO TREND IDENTIFIED. THE COMPATIBILITY CHECK COULD NOT BE PERFORMED AS ONLY ONE PRODUCT WAS REPORTED TO US. THE PRODUCT COMPATIBILITY CHECK IS NOT RELEVANT FOR ONE PRODUCT ONLY. DEVICES ANALYSIS: THERE WERE TWO PICTURES PROVIDED. ON THE PICTURES THE BROKEN PARTS (NOTCHES/TAP) OF THE LAG SCREW WERE VISIBLE. THE BROKEN LAG SCREW WAS RETURNED FOR INVESTIGATION. ON THE BROKEN LAG SCREW IT COULD BE SEEN THAT THE NOTCHES WERE COMPLETELY BROKEN. THE BROKEN PARTS WERE NOT RETURNED FOR INVESTIGATION. IN ADDITION, A SET SCREW WAS INSERTED INTO THE INNER DIAMETER OF THE LAG SCREW. THIS WAS MOST PROBABLY DONE TO REMOVE THE LAG SCREW FROM THE BONE. FURTHERMORE, THE THREAD PART OF THE LAG SCREW AND THE SHAFT AREA SHOWED MASSIVE ABRASION. THIS MUST BE OCCURRED IN COMBINATION WITH THE NAIL DUE TO HIGH FORCES APPLIED ON THE LAG SCREW AND/OR DUE TO WRONG POSITIONING OF THE LAG SCREW/NAIL. REVIEW OF INCOMING INFORMATION: THE SURGICAL TECHNIQUE DESCRIBES THE CORRECT INSERTION OF THE LAG SCREW. ""ATTACH THE LAG SCREW TO THE LAG SCREW INSERTER USING THE LAG SCREW RETAINING SHAFT TO FULLY SECURE THE SCREW TO THE INSERTER."" NOTE: DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN THE LAG SCREW. THE DISTAL EDGE MUST PROTRUDE LATERALLY THROUGH THE FEMUR TO ENSURE THAT SLIDING CAN OCCUR. POSSIBLE CAUSES FOR THE REPORTED EVENT ACCORDING TO RMW: DAMAGE OF LAG SCREW DUE TO USERS NOT CHOOSE THE PROPER ALIGNMENT AND POSITION FOR LAG SCREW PLACEMENT; BREAKAGE OF IMPLANT DUE TO USERS NOT CHOOSE THE CORRECT CCD ANGLE TARGETING GUIDE LEADING TO DRILLING OF THE NAIL; BREAKAGE OF IMPLANT DUE TO USERS OVERTIGHTEN THE LAG SCREW IN THE BONE; BREAKAGE OF IMPLANT DUE TO USERS POSITION THE LAG SCREW THAT SLIDING IS NOT POSSIBLE. COMPARISON TO INVESTIGATION RESULTS WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE AND JUSTIFICATION: POSSIBLE: NO SURGICAL REPORT AND FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE SURGICAL PROCEDURE WAS RECEIVED. IT WAS UNKNOWN HOW THE USER TRIED TO INSERT THE LAG SCREW. NO INFORMATION WAS GIVEN WHICH INSTRUMENT WAS USED TO INSERT THE LAG SCREW; POSSIBLE: NO INFORMATION RECEIVED IF THE USER USED THE CORRECT CCD ANGLE OF THE TARGETING GUIDE. NO SURGICAL REPORT WAS RECEIVED; POSSIBLE: IN THE VISUAL EXAMINATION THERE WERE SIGNS OF OVERTIGHTENING OF THE LAG SCREW IN THE BONE VISIBLE. ABRASION MARKS COULD BE FOUND ON THE LAG SCREW. A WRONG POSITIONING OF THE LAG SCREW WAS ALSO POSSIBLE; POSSIBLE: NO SURGICAL REPORT AND FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE SURGICAL PROCEDURE WAS RECEIVED. THERE ARE SEVERAL FACTORS WHICH MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE BREAKAGE. OVERTIGHTENING OF THE LAG SCREW; WRONG POSITIONING OF THE LAG SCREW THE INSTRUMENT WHICH WAS USED TO INSERT THE LAG SCREW WAS NOT FULLY ADAPTED TO THE LAG SCREW NOTCHES. HOWEVER, BASED ON THE GIVEN INFORMATION AND THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION, WE WERE NOT ABLE TO IDENTIFY A SPECIFIC ROOT CAUSE FOR THIS ISSUE. IT WAS REPORTED, THAT DURING IMPLANTING THE Z NAIL 10.5 X 85 LAG SCREW ITS ATTACHMENT NOTCH WAS BROKEN ON (B)(6) 2015. DEVICE WAS REMOVED, PROCEDURE WAS COMPLETED WITH DIFFERENT SIZE SAME PRODUCT SURGERY WAS DELAYED FOR 45 MINUTES."|1069
COMPARISON OF RETURNED SAMPLES TO OTHER SAMPLES INDICATED THAT THE WELD DEPTH OF THE RETURNED SAMPLES WAS REDUCED. AS A RESULT, THE FAILURE INVESTIGATION FOCUSED ON (B)(4) LASER WELDING PROCESS. AN INVESTIGATION, A FAILURE ANALYSIS, WAS CONDUCTED AND BASED ON INVESTIGATION FINDINGS THE LASER WELDING PROCESS WAS REVALIDATED TO OPTIMIZE OPERATING PARAMETERS AND TO ENSURE THAT THE PROCESS IS ROBUST TO LASER LOCATION. THE PROCESS VALIDATION WAS COMPLETED ON (B)(6) 2005 (REFERENCE (B)(4)). RESULTS SHOW THAT THE LASER WELDING PROCESS IS ROBUST TO LASER LOCATION AND CAPABLE OF CONSISTENTLY PRODUCING SIGNIFICANTLY STRONGER WELDS AND WILL AFFECT LOT #1340390 AT (B)(4) NOTE THAT ALTHOUGH THE AFFECT OF MISALIGNMENT IS NOW EVIDENT, IT IS NOT SUSPECTED THAT FREQUENCY OF MISALIGNMENT IS HIGH. THIS IS BASED ON (B)(4) DISCLOSURE THAT ,TO DATE, ALL SAMPLES TESTED SINCE PRODUCTION BEGAN IN LATE 2004 HAVE MET SPECIFICATION. ADDITIONALLY, ALL FINISHED GOODS TESTED DURING THIS FAILURE INVESTIGATION HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDED SPECIFICATION INDICATING THAT CAPABILITY FOR APPROPRIATELY LOCATING THE LASER WAS LIKELY HIGH. AT THIS TIME, IT IS INCONCLUSIVE IF SURGICAL TECHNIQUE IS CAUSE FOR OR CONTRIBUTES TO DEVICE FAILURE. DUE TO THE MODE OF FAILURE OF THE RECENT COMPLAINTS, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO QUANTIFY POINT OF FAILURE FOR THE ASSOCIATED DEVICES SINCE THE DEVICES WERE FULLY COMPROMISED. THE DESIGN INPUT SPECIFICATIONS THAT ARE RELATIVE TO THE WELD STRENGTH WERE REVIEWED BY R & D AND MARKETING FOR CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE AND WERE DEEMED TO BE ADEQUATE AND APPROPRIATE FOR THE INTENDED USE. AS A RESULT, NO CHANGES TO SPECIFICATIONS WILL BE MADE. AT THIS POINT IN TIME NO FURTHER ACTION IS WARRANTED. OUR AFFILIATE IS REPORTING THAT DURING A SHOULDER REPAIR THE DISTAL PORTION OF A SUTURE GRASPER BROKE OFF INTO THE PATIENT'S BODY. ALL WAS RETRIEVED AND THE CASE WAS CONCLUDED SUCCESSFULLY WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT OR HARM TO THE PATIENT.|1638

THE PATIENT STATED THE DOCTOR TOLD HIM THAT THE MANUFACTURER HAD SOME NEW PROGRAMMING. NOW, THE PATIENT WAS AT AN IMPASSE, THE DOCTORS WOULD NOT INCREASE THE FENTANYL PATCH PAST 50 MG. THE PAIN LEVEL HAD GOTTEN MUCH WORSE OVER THE YEARS AND THE PATIENT HAD GONE FROM 12 TO 25 TO 37 TO 50 MG. THE BATTERY THE PATIENT HAD WAS DEAD, SO THEY TRIED A TRICKLE CHARGE. IT WORKED, BUT THE BATTERY BEING 5 YEARS OLD WOULD NOT HOLD A CHANGE WITH WHAT THEY WERE ABLE TO DO AND THE PATIENT THOUGHT IT WAS HELPING. THE PATIENT DID NOT THINK HIS INSURANCE OR THE MANUFACTURER WOULD COVER A NEW ONE SINCE THE BATTERY WAS ONLY 5 YEARS OLD AND HE THANKED THE MANUFACTURER FOR THE CHANCE OF TRYING. THE CONSUMER REPORTED A LOSS OF STIMULATION, LOSS OF THERAPY, AND RETURN OF SYMPTOMS. THEY WERE DOING A TRICKLE CHARGE AT THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE ON THE DAY OF THE REPORT BECAUSE THE LAST TIME THE PATIENT CHARGED WAS TWO YEARS PRIOR. THE REASON THE PATIENT STOPPED CHARGING OR USING HIS SPINAL CORD STIMULATION WAS THAT IT WAS NOT WORKING TO HELP HIS SYMPTOMS. IT DID NOT GIVE THE STIMULATION THEY THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO AND AFTER IMPLANT THE STIMULATION WENT AWAY AND IT DID NOT GIVE THE PATIENT ANYTHING SO HE JUST SHUT IT OFF. THE PATIENT STATED HE FOUND OUT FROM THE MANAGING HEALTHCARE PROVIDER (HCP) OFFICE THAT THEY RECENTLY CAME OUT WITH NEW WAYS OF PROGRAMMING THE SPINAL CORD STIMULATION. THE PATIENT'S PAIN WAS GETTING WORSE AND THE DOCTOR WOULD NOT GIVE HIM ANYTHING HIGHER THAN A 50 FENTANYL PATCH AND THE PATIENT RECENTLY STARTED TAKING LYRICA AGAIN. IT WAS NOTED THE PATIENT HAD PADDLE LEADS IMPLANTED. THEY GOT 8 BARS, SO THE IMPLANT WAS CHARGING DURING THE TRICKLE CHARGE. THEY WOULD BE DOING HIGH DEFINITION PROGRAMMING WHERE HE DID NOT FEEL STIMULATION. THE PATIENT SAID HIS PAIN WAS LIKE WALKING ON CHARCOAL BRICKETS. THIS WAS ON THE BALL OF THE FOOT AND TOES ON BOTH FEET. SINCE IMPLANT, THE PATIENT WAS NOT GETTING THERAPEUTIC EFFECT AND HAD NO STIMULATION SENSATION. IT WAS UNKNOWN WHEN THE IMPLANTABLE NEUROSTIMULATOR (INS) BATTERY DIED REQUIRING THE TRICKLE CHARGE. THE PATIENT ALSO MENTIONED THAT HE HAD TRIED TO TAKE HIS LIFE 3 TIMES OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS BECAUSE OF HIS PAIN.

POSTERIOR CAPSULE (PC) TEAR IS A POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCE OF CATARACT EXTRACTION BY PHACOEMULSIFICATION. PREDISPOSITION TO PC TEAR OR ZONULAR DEHISCENCE CAN BE INFLUENCED BY MANY FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CONGENITAL POSTERIOR LENTICONUS, POSTERIOR SUB CAPSULAR (PSC) CATARACT, POOR VISIBILITY SECONDARY TO PATIENTS COMORBIDITY [IE. DENSE ARCUS, PTERYGIUM, BAND KERATOPATHY, CORNEAL SCARS, INTERSTITIAL KERATITIS], POOR MICROSCOPE ILLUMINATION [RED REFLEX], ERGONOMIC OBSTACLES, LIMITED INTRAOCULAR WORKING SPACE, ABNORMALLY LONG OR SHORT AXIAL LENGTHS, PSEUDOEXFOLIATION, ZONULAR LAXITY, POOR DILATION, INTRAOPERATIVE FLOPPY IRIS SYNDROME (IFIS), DENSE CATARACTS, ASTEROID HYALOSIS, OR INADVERTENT PATIENT MOVEMENT. THE CONDITIONS THAT INCREASE THE RISK OF PC TEAR DURING PHACOEMULSIFICATION INCLUDE ERGONOMIC OBSTACLES, LIMITED INTRAOCULAR WORKING SPACE, POOR VISUALIZATION, INCREASED NUCLEAR SIZE AND DENSITY, WEAKENED ZONULE, A RADIAL TEAR IN THE CAPSULORHEXIS, AND AN INABILITY TO ROTATE THE NUCLEUS OR EPINUCLEUS. THESE CONDITIONS MAY ARISE EITHER BECAUSE OF THE OCULAR ANATOMY, OR BECAUSE OF SURGICAL TECHNIQUE.

DEPLOYMENT OF THE SAPIEN VALVE TOO AORTIC HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CONTRIBUTE TO SUBOPTIMAL COAPTATION OF THE SAPIEN VALVE LEAFLETS AND CAUSE CENTRAL AORTIC INSUFFICIENCY; IT CAN OBSTRUCT THE CORONARY OSTIA; AND LEAD TO EMBOLIZATION OF THE PROSTHESIS INTO THE ASCENDING AORTA. PER THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE, VALVE EMBOLIZATION IS A KNOWN POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSCATHETER AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT (TAVR) PROCEDURE. THERE ARE MULTIPLE PATIENT AND PROCEDURAL FACTORS THAT ALONE OR IN COMBINATION CAN CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO AORTIC EMBOLIZATION, INCLUDING IMPROPER POSITIONING PRIOR TO DEPLOYMENT, POOR IMAGE INTENSIFIER ANGLE, POOR COAXIAL ALIGNMENT OF THE VALVE AND DELIVERY SYSTEM, SEVERE SEPTAL HYPERTROPHY, MINIMALLY OR BULKY/SEVERELY CALCIFIED AORTIC LEAFLETS, PRESERVED EJECTION FRACTION, LOSS OF PACING CAPTURE, RAPID DEPLOYMENT, RELEASE OF STORED TENSION DURING DEPLOYMENT, AND MOVEMENT OF THE DELIVERY SYSTEM BY THE OPERATOR. THE THV TRAINING MANUALS INSTRUCT THE OPERATOR ON PROPER POSITIONING AND DEPLOYMENT OF THE VALVE, INCLUDING ALL PROCEDURAL AND ANATOMICAL CONSIDERATIONS. PHYSICIANS ARE EXTENSIVELY TRAINED BY EDWARDS BEFORE THEY ARE QUALIFIED TO USE THE SAPIEN THV. TRAINING INCLUDES PATIENT SCREENING, DEVICE PREPARATION, APPROACH, DEPLOYMENT, IMAGING, PROCEDURE-SPECIFIC TRAINING MANUALS AND PROCTORED PROCEDURES. THE CORRECT ALIGNMENT AND POSITIONING OF THE DEVICE AT THE POINT OF DEPLOYMENT IS EMPHASIZED AS A KEY FACTOR TO THE PLACEMENT AND FIXATION OF THE DEVICE. OPERATORS ARE ALSO INSTRUCTED TO USE FLUOROSCOPY AS THE PRIMARY METHOD OF VISUALIZATION FOR POSITIONING AND DEPLOYMENT. IN PATIENTS WITH HIGH-RISK ANATOMICAL FEATURES FOR AORTIC EMBOLIZATION (I.E. MINIMAL LEAFLET CALCIFICATION, SEVERE SEPTAL HYPERTROPHY), BAV MAY PROVIDE INDICATION OF POTENTIAL BALLOON MOVEMENT DURING VALVE DEPLOYMENT IN THIS CASE, AS REPORTED, THE MALPOSITION OF THE VALVE WAS LIKELY DUE TO AN ?OPERATOR ERROR?. THE MALPOSITION OF THE VALVE AND POSSIBLE VALVE UNDER-SIZING MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE VALVE EMBOLIZATION. THE IFU AND TRAINING MANUALS HAVE BEEN REVIEWED AND NO INADEQUACIES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED WITH REGARDS TO WARNINGS, CONTRAINDICATIONS, AND THE DIRECTIONS/CONDITIONS FOR THE SUCCESSFUL USE OF THE DEVICE. COMPLAINT HISTORIES FOR ALL REPORTED EVENTS ARE REVIEWED AGAINST TRENDING CONTROL LIMITS ON A MONTHLY BASIS, AND ANY EXCURSIONS ABOVE THE CONTROL LIMITS ARE ASSESSED AND DOCUMENTED AS PART OF THIS MONTHLY REVIEW. NO CORRECTIVE OR PREVENTATIVE ACTIONS ARE REQUIRED. AS REPORTED BY OUR AFFILIATES IN (B)(4), DURING TRANSFEMORAL IMPLANT OF A 29MM SAPIEN XT VALVE, THE VALVE WAS DEPLOYED SLIGHTLY AORTIC IN AN 80:20 AORTIC/VENTRICULAR POSITION DUE TO AN OPERATOR ERROR, RESULTING IN MILD-MODERATE PVL. THE DELIVERY SYSTEM HAD BEEN PREPPED WITH NOMINAL VOLUME. THE VALVE WAS POST DILATED WITH AND ADDITIONAL 2CC OF VOLUME. WHILE ADVANCING THE DELIVERY SYSTEM, IT WAS NOTICED THE VALVE WAS NOT STABLE AND THE VALVE EMBOLIZED INTO THE AORTA DURING POST DILATION. THE VALVE WAS POSITIONED IN THE AORTIC ARCH AND A SECOND 29MM SAPIEN XT VALVE WAS IMPLANTED WITH GOOD RESULT. THERE WAS NO CONSEQUENCE FOR THE PATIENT. THE PATIENT?S NATIVE ANNULUS WAS 6.1CM2 BY CT AND WAS MODERATELY CALCIFIED.|1457

"THE COMMANDER DELIVERY SYSTEM WAS RETURNED TO EDWARDS FOR EVALUATION. DURING FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS, THE INFLATION BALLOON WAS MARKED PRIOR TO INFLATION AND THE DEVICE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY INFLATED WITH NOMINAL VOLUME AND INSPECTED. DURING INFLATION, THE BALLOON WAS NOTED TO ROTATE APPROXIMATELY 270 DEGREES CLOCKWISE AT FULL INFLATION. THE BALLOON ORIENTATION WAS NOTED TO RETURN TO ITS ORIGINAL POSITION FOLLOWING FULL DEFLATION. INFLATION AND DEFLATION TIMES WERE TESTED AND A TREND TOWARDS SLOWER INFLATION AND DEFLATION TIMES WERE OBSERVED. ADDITIONALLY, AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO RE-CREATE THE FAILURE MODE DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. IT WAS IDENTIFIED THAT DURING THE GUIDEWIRE SHAFT CUTTING PROCEDURE A PINCHING OF THE GUIDEWIRE SHAFT PREVENTED FREE ROTATION OF THE GUIDEWIRE SHAFT, THUS RESULTING IN A TWISTING OF THE CRIMP BALLOON. IMAGE REVIEW OF THE CASE CONFIRMED A PROLONGED DEFLATION TIME, HOWEVER, THE REPORTED ?TWISTING? OF THE BALLOON DURING INFLATION WAS NOT SEEN. BASED ON THE CONDITION OF THE RETURNED DEVICE, THE COMPLAINT WAS CONFIRMED FOR BALLOON INCORRECT SHAPE COMPLAINT; RE-CREATION EFFORTS IDENTIFIED DEVICE ROTATION DURING THE GUIDEWIRE SHAFT CUTTING PROCEDURE AS A POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTOR TO THE OBSERVED FAILURE MODE. DUE TO THE HIGH CRITICALITY FOR THIS FAILURE MODE, A CAPA HAS BEEN INITIATED. DURING TRANSFEMORAL DEPLOYMENT OF A 29MM SAPIEN 3 VALVE, 'THE BALLOON TWISTED IN THE ANNULUS DURING RELEASE THE VALVE (ONE-HALF ROTATION)"". IT APPEARED WHEN THE BALLOON WAS FILLED WITH VOLUME, THE BALLOON ""MAKES A ROTATION."" THE RESULT WERE FINE. AT THE TIME OF THE REPORT THE PATIENT WAS STABLE. REVIEW OF THE PROCEDURAL ANGIOGRAPHY WAS COMPLETED BY AN EDWARDS PHYSICIAN PROCTOR. THE REVIEW SHOWED THE VALVE WAS IN A GOOD POSITION PRIOR TO DEPLOYMENT. THE REPORTED ?TWISTING? OF THE BALLOON DURING INFLATION WAS NOT OBSERVED. GOOD IMPLANT TECHNIQUE AND RESULTS WERE NOTED. THE BALLOON DEFLATION APPEARED UNUSUAL AND PROLONGED. OBSERVATIONS/IMPRESSION: THE REPORTED EVENT WAS NOT OBSERVED AND THE SLOW DEFLATION CANNOT BE EXPLAINED. THE INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING."|1157

THE PATIENT WAS IMPLANTED WITH A LEFT VENTRICULAR ASSIST DEVICE. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT WAS ADMITTED WITH AN INCREASED LACTATE DEHYDROGENASE LEVEL (LDH) OF 554 U/L AND PLACED ON INTEGRILIN AND ARGATROBAN. THE PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED HOME ON (B)(6) 2015 ON COUMADIN AND ASPIRIN WITH AN INR GOAL OF 2.0-2.5. ON (B)(6) 2015, THE PATIENT HAD A GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED AND WAS TAKEN OFF OF ANTICOAGULATION SHORT TERM, BUT WENT BACK ON COUMADIN AND ASPIRIN WITH THE SAME INR GOAL OF 2.0-2.5. ON (B)(6) 2015, THE PATIENT'S SPOUSE CONTACTED THE VAD TEAM TO REPORT THE PATIENT HAD DARK URINE. THE PATIENT WAS ADMITTED THAT SAME DAY WITH AN ELEVATED LDH LEVEL OF 1719 U/L AND WAS PLACED ON INTEGRILIN. THE PATIENT'S INR WAS 2.3. ON (B)(6) 2015, THE PATIENT RECEIVED A PUMP EXCHANGE. POST PUMP EXCHANGE, IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT WAS STABLE IN THE STEP DOWN UNIT AND WAS SCHEDULED TO BE DISCHARGED IN A FEW DAYS. DEVICE UNIQUE IDENTIFIER (UDI) ? DEVICE WAS MANUFACTURED PRIOR TO THE UDI LABELING IMPLEMENTATION. APPROXIMATE AGE OF DEVICE ? 4 YEARS AND 5 MONTHS. DEVICE EVALUATION: THE REPORT OF HEMOLYSIS AND SUSPECTED THROMBUS WAS CONFIRMED BASED ON THE EVALUATION OF (B)(4); HOWEVER, A SPECIFIC CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED GI BLEED AND A CORRELATION TO THE EVALUATION COULD NOT BE CONCLUSIVELY DETERMINED. BLEEDING IS LISTED IN THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE AS A POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENT THAT MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF HEARTMATE II LEFT VENTRICULAR ASSIST SYSTEM. UPON DISASSEMBLY OF THE RETURNED PUMP, EXAMINATION OF THE DISTAL-SIDE OF THE INLET STATOR REVEALED A DENATURED THROMBUS RING ADHERED TO THE INLET BEARING CUP. A SIMILAR RING WAS FOUND SITUATED ON THE INLET BEARING BALL OF THE BLOOD TUBE/ROTOR INLET SECTION. THE THROMBUS RINGS APPEARED TO HAVE EVIDENCE OF LAMINATED LAYERING, WHICH INDICATES THAT THEY WERE PRESENT WHILE THE PUMP WAS OPERATING. THE THROMBUS RINGS WERE SIMILAR IN COLOR AND STRUCTURE WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THEY WERE A SINGLE FORMATION PRIOR TO DISASSEMBLY OF THE PUMP. EXAMINATION OF THE ROTOR REVEALED A NON-LAMINATED DEPOSITION SITUATED IN BETWEEN THE BLADES OF THE ROTOR. THE STRUCTURE OF THE DEPOSITION SUGGESTED THAT IT DID NOT DEVELOP ON THE ROTOR. THE DEPOSITION HAD AREAS THAT APPEARED DENATURED WHICH IS INDICATION THAT THE DEPOSITION WAS LIKELY PRESENT WHILE THE PUMP WAS IN OPERATION. ALTHOUGH ITS ORIGINS CANNOT BE CONCLUSIVELY DETERMINED, THE DEPOSITION WAS SIMILAR TO THE RINGS FOUND ON THE INLET BEARINGS, AND LIKELY DEVELOPED THERE. THE THROMBUS FORMATIONS FOUND IN THE PUMP WOULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED CLINICAL SIGNS OF HEMOLYSIS. EXAMINATION OF THE PUMP BEARINGS, ROTOR, AND BLOOD-CONTACTING SURFACES UNDER A MICROSCOPE, REVEALED NO ABNORMALITIES THAT WOULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE FORMATION OF THE THROMBUS. THE PUMP UNDERWENT CLEANING, REASSEMBLY AND FUNCTIONAL TESTING UNDER LOADED CONDITIONS USING A MOCK CIRCULATORY LOOP. THE RETRIEVED DATA REVEALED NORMAL PUMP POWER CONSUMPTION COMPARABLE TO THE PUMP POWER CONSUMPTION RECORDED DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. THE PUMP OPERATED AS INTENDED. A REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORDS REVEALED THE DEVICE MET APPLICABLE SPECIFICATIONS. NO FURTHER INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED. THE MANUFACTURER IS CLOSING THE FILE ON THIS EVENT.|2993
AS REPORTED BY A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL, THE RESHEATHING TOOL OF THE DELTAPAQ ((B)(4)/C23354) WAS TORN WHEN THE SURGEON TRIED TO RESHEATH THE COIL. PRODUCT ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE SHEATH WAS SEPARATED FROM THE DPU AND THE PROXIMAL SECTION OF THE COIL WAS STRETCHED. THERE WAS NO POTENTIAL PATIENT ADVERSE EVENT. NO FURTHER INFORMATION COULD BE OBTAINED FROM THE CUSTOMER. THE COMPLAINT WAS RECEIVED ON (B)(6) 2015, AND THE DEVICE WAS RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS ON 12/22/2015. THE COIL STRETCH WAS CONFIRMED ON 01/04/2016 WHEN THE ANALYSIS WAS COMPLETED; THEREFORE THE COMPLAINT MET MDR REPORTABILITY CRITERIA ON 01/04/2016. (B)(4). INFORMATION REGARDING PATIENT AGE, WEIGHT, GENDER AND MEDICAL HISTORY COULD NOT BE OBTAINED. ALTHOUGH THREE ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WERE MADE, NO FURTHER INFORMATION COULD BE OBTAINED FROM THE CUSTOMER. COMPLAINT CONCLUSION: THE DELTAPAQ WAS RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS. THE UNIDENTIFIED MICROCATHETER AND THE ROTATING HEMOSTATIC VALVE (RHV) WERE NOT RETURNED. CONCERNING CLEANLINESS ONLY, THE MICROCOIL SYSTEM WAS RETURNED IN ALMOST PRISTINE CONDITION. THE SYSTEM WAS EITHER NOT USED OR WAS CLEANED/RINSED BEFORE BEING RETURNED WHICH MAY HAVE PRODUCED FURTHER DAMAGE. IT IS ALSO UNKNOWN IF THE DEVICE WAS FURTHER MANIPULATED AND/OR INSPECTED POST-PROCEDURALLY. AS VIEWED THROUGH THE RETURNED PACKAGING, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE COIL WAS UNSHEATHED AND ENTANGLED. UNREPORTED DAMAGE OF THE DEVICE POSITIONING UNIT (DPU) AND THE SHEATH THAT WERE FOUND RETURNED SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER. WITH THIS UNREPORTED SEPARATION OF THE SHEATH AND DPU, THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE COMPLAINT CANNOT BE DETERMINED. LOCATED 135.0 CENTIMETERS OFF THE PROXIMAL END IS UNREPORTED DAMAGE OF A SEVERE KINK TO THE CORE WIRE. UNREPORTED DAMAGE OF THE COIL BEING STRETCHED AT THE PROXIMAL SECTION WAS FOUND. THE COIL?S SOCKET RING WAS FOUND PUSHED DOWN INSIDE THE OUTER SHEATH. THIS CAUSED A LOSS OF CONCENTRICITY BETWEEN THE DISTAL TIP OF THE DPU AND THE PROXIMAL END OF THE COIL. THIS CONDITION HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE RESISTANCE. THE REMAINDER OF THE COIL IS UNDAMAGED. LOCATED ON THE TOP PROXIMAL END OF THE RESHEATHING TOOL IN THE OPEN CUTOUT SECTION, THE V NOTCH HAS BEEN SEVERELY DAMAGED WITH THE DAMAGED EDGES RAISED ABOVE THE SURFACE PLANE. THE LOCKING MECHANISM HAS COMPRESSION AND STRETCHING DAMAGE. THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF HOW AND WHEN THE ABOVE UNREPORTED DAMAGE OCCURRED CANNOT BE DETERMINED. IN ADDITION, POST-PROCEDURAL CLEANING, HANDLING, AND PACKAGING MAY HAVE PRODUCED ADDITIONAL DAMAGE. NO MANUFACTURING DEFECTS WERE FOUND. A REVIEW OF THE MANUFACTURING DOCUMENTATION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOT PRESENTED NO ISSUES DURING THE MANUFACTURING OR INSPECTION PROCESS THAT CAN BE RELATED TO THE REPORTED COMPLAINT. THE COMPLAINT OF RESHEATHING TOOL DAMAGE WAS CONFIRMED. WHILE THE EXACT ROOT CAUSE OF THE DAMAGE DURING RESHEATHING CANNOT BE DETERMINED THERE ARE TWO POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS. THE EVIDENCE HIGHLY SUGGESTS THAT THE PRIMARY CONTRIBUTING FACTOR PRODUCING DAMAGE TO THE UNIT MAY HAVE FIRST OCCURRED WHEN THE MICROCOIL SYSTEM WAS FIRST UNLOCKED FOR USE AND THE SHEATH WAS RETRACTED STRAIGHT BACK INSTEAD OF UP AT A FORTY-FIVE DEGREE ANGLE AND THEN BACK. WHEN THE SHEATH WAS PULLED STRAIGHT BACK, THE LOCKING MECHANISM CAUGHT THE INSIDE OF THE V NOTCH OF THE RESHEATHING TOOL AND BECAME EMBEDDED. IN ADDITION, THE LOCKING MECHANISM MAY NOT HAVE BEEN FULLY DISENGAGED OFF THE CORE WIRE. THE SHEATH ALSO CAUGHT THE V NOTCHES EXTENDED EDGES. THIS PRODUCED A BINDING ACTION BETWEEN THE DEVICE POSITIONING UNIT (DPU), THE SHEATH, AND THE COIL. THIS BINDING ACTION PRODUCED SIGNIFICANT RESISTANCE WHICH DAMAGED THE RESHEATHING TOOL, PRODUCED A PORTION OF THE COIL DAMAGE FOUND, KINKED THE CORE WIRE, AND PUSHED THE COILS SOCKET RING DOWN INSIDE THE OUTER SHEATH. FOR OPTIMUM PRODUCT PERFORMANCE AND TO PREVENT POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS, THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU) RECOMMENDS, ?HOLD THE INTRODUCER SHEATH (LOOSELY-LOOPED) IN THE LEFT HAND. KEEPING THE INTRODUCER TIP NEAR THE RE-SHEATHING TOOL, GRASP THE DISTAL END OF THE RE-SHEATHING TOOL BETWEEN YOUR LEFT THUMB AND FOREFINGER. GRASP THE CLEAR TAB NEAR THE END OF THE INTRODUCER SHEATH BODY WITH THE THUMB AND FOREFINGER OF YOUR OTHER HAND. GENTLY PULL THE CLEAR TAB OF THE INTRODUCER SHEATH OUT AND AWAY FROM THE RE SHEATHING TOOL AT A 45-DEGREE ANGLE TO UNLOCK THE MICROCOIL. CONTINUE TO PULL THE TAB UNTIL AN ADDITIONAL 0.5 TO 1.0 INCHES (1.3 TO 2.5 CM) OF THE TRANSLUCENT MATERIAL IS EXPOSED. GENTLY FOLD THE TRANSLUCENT TAB TOWARDS THE DISTAL END, AND FIRMLY GRASP THE DISTAL END OF THE RE SHEATHING TOOL AND THE TRANSLUCENT TAB BETWEEN YOUR THUMB AND FOREFINGER. CAUTION: IF UNUSUAL FRICTION IS NOTICED DURING ADVANCEMENT OR RETRACTION OF THE MICROCOIL SYSTEM, VERIFY THE LOCKING MECHANISM, OR CLEAR TAB IS UNLOCKED AND PULLED OUT FROM THE RESHEATHING TOOL APPROXIMATELY 1IN. (2-3CM).? IN ADDITION, WITHOUT THE IDENTIFICATION OR THE RETURN OF THE UNKNOWN MICROCATHETER AND THE RJHV USED IN THE PROCEDURE, IT CANNOT BE DETERMINED IF THESE COMPONENTS HAD ANY ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE COMPLAINT EVENT. THE SECONDARY CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE RESHEATHING TOOLS DAMAGE MAY HAVE OCCURRED WHEN THE DPU WITH THE ATTACHED COIL WAS SEPARATED FROM THE SHEATH DURING THE RESHEATHING PROCESS. THIS MAY HAVE DAMAGED THE RESHEATHING TOOL AND PRODUCED THE COIL DAMAGE AND THE OTHER UNREPORTED DAMAGE FOUND TO THE UNIT. SINCE THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF A MANUFACTURING ISSUE RELATED TO THE EVENT, NO CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WILL BE TAKEN AT THIS TIME. THIS IS AN INITIAL/FINAL MDR REPORT.|761
(B)(4). THE ANALYSIS RESULTS OF THE POUCH FOUND THAT ONLY THE BAG WAS RECEIVED FOR ANALYSIS. UPON EVALUATION, THE BAG WAS NOTED TO BE TORN AT THE BOTTOM END (NOT AT THE SEAMS). THE TORN PORTION WAS NOTED STRETCHED. A POTENTIAL CAUSE OF THE TORN BAG IS ATTEMPT TO REMOVE THE BAG WITH SPECIMEN THROUGH THE TROCAR OR FORCE THE BAG THROUGH THE ACCESS SITE AS THIS MAY LEAD TO BAG RUPTURE AND SPILLAGE OF CONTENTS. THE FOLLOWING OPTIONS ARE RECOMMENDED IN ORDER TO AVOID THIS KIND OF ISSUE: REMOVE THE INSTRUMENT, SPECIMEN BAG, AND TROCAR TOGETHER FORM THE ACCESS SITE (DO NOT PULL THE SLIP KNOT). REMOVE THE INSTRUMENT FROM THE TROCAR, FOLLOWING BY THE SPECIMEN BAG WITH THE TROCAR. REMOVE THE INSTRUMENT, TROCAR AND SPECIMEN BAG SEPARATELY FROM THE ACCESS SITE. IF THE BAG WITH THE SPECIMEN CANNOT BE REMOVED THROUGH THE ACCESS SITE, CAREFULLY ENLARGE THE ACCESS SITE TO FACILITATE EASY BAG REMOVAL. THE BATCH RECORD WAS REVIEWED AND NO ANOMALIES WERE NOTED DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A GALLBADDER PROCEDURE, THE BAG RIPPED WITHOUT TOUCHING AT THE BOTTOM WHILE TRYING TO TAKE THE GALLBLADDER OUT OF THE PORT SITE, BAG RIPPED AROUND THE GALLBLADDER. UNKNOWN HOW CASE WAS COMPLETED. THERE WERE NO ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE PATIENT.|3024

(B)(4). EVALUATION SUMMARY: UNIQUE DEVICE IDENTIFIER (UDI) NUMBER: (B)(4). THE CLIP DELIVERY SYSTEM (CDS) WAS RETURNED FOR EVALUATION. THE REPORTED CDS UNABLE TO CURVE THE SLEEVE AND CDS DIFFICULT TO REMOVE FROM SGC COULD NOT BE CONFIRMED VIA RETURNED DEVICE ANALYSIS. THE RETURNED DEVICE ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE DEVICE FUNCTIONED AS EXPECTED WITH NO CDS MECHANICAL ISSUE OR DIFFICULTY REMOVING THE CDS. THE DIFFICULTY REMOVING THE CDS FROM THE ANATOMY COULD NOT BE REPLICATED IN THE TESTING ENVIRONMENT, AS THESE REPORTED EVENTS WERE BASED ON OPERATIONAL/PROCEDURAL/PATHOLOGICAL CIRCUMSTANCES. A DEFINITIVE CAUSE FOR THE REPORTED CDS UNABLE TO CURVE THE SLEEVE APPEARS TO BE RELATED TO THE PROCEDURAL CONDITION, WHILE A DEFINITIVE CAUSE FOR DIFFICULT CLIP RETRACTION FROM THE GUIDE TIP AND FROM THE ANATOMY CANNOT BE CONFIRMED. A REVIEW OF THE LOT HISTORY RECORD IDENTIFIED NO MANUFACTURING NONCONFORMITIES ISSUED TO THE REPORTED LOT THAT WOULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED EVENT. ADDITIONALLY, A REVIEW OF THE COMPLAINT HISTORY IDENTIFIED NO OTHER INCIDENT REPORTED FROM THIS LOT. BASED ON THE INFORMATION REVIEWED, THERE IS NO INDICATION OF A PRODUCT QUALITY ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO MANUFACTURE, DESIGN OR LABELING. THIS IS FILED TO REPORT THAT DURING REMOVAL OF THE CLIP DELIVERY SYSTEM, IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THE CLIP BECAME CAUGHT ON THE PULMONARY VEIN AND MET RESISTANCE WITH THE GUIDE TIP. DIFFICULTY REMOVING THE DEVICE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO PATIENT INJURY. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THIS WAS A MITRACLIP PROCEDURE TO TREAT DEGENERATIVE MITRAL REGURGITATION (MR) WITH A GRADE OF 4. THE CLIP DELIVERY SYSTEM (CDS) WAS ADVANCED TO THE LEFT ATRIUM WITHOUT ISSUE. AFTER SUCCESSFUL LEAFLET STRADDLING, THE M-KNOB WAS APPLIED, BUT DID NOT RESPOND. THE GUIDE WAS RETRACTED AND MOVED POSTERIOR / LATERAL BUT THE CDS WAS NOT RESPONDING. INITIALLY, IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THE DEVICES WERE MIS-KEYED (MARKERS MISALIGNED); THEREFORE, M WAS REMOVED AND THE CDS WAS PULLED BACK BUT BECAME CAUGHT ON THE TIP OF THE STEERABLE GUIDING CATHETER (SGC). TROUBLESHOOTING MANEUVERS WERE PERFORMED AND THE CDS WAS FREED FROM THE SGC TIP. THE CDS WAS REMOVED AND CORRECT MARKER ALIGNMENT WAS CONFIRMED. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE DEVICE WAS NOT RESPONDING TO M-KNOB DUE TO BEING CAUGHT IN THE PULMONARY VEIN. A NEW CDS WAS ADVANCED WITHOUT ISSUE. THE CLIP WAS IMPLANTED, REDUCING THE MR TO 2. THERE WERE NO ADVERSE PATIENT EFFECTS AND NO CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT DELAY IN THE PROCEDURE. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED.|1528

IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A LEFT AND RIGHT FEMUR SURGERY WHILE INSERTING A TROCHANTERIC FIXATION NAIL (TFN) AS THE SURGEON WENT TO PUT IN THE HELICAL BLADE THROUGH THE TFN NAIL THE CONNECTING SCREW BROKE AT THE END WHILE USING A MALLET TO INSERT THE HELICAL BLADE. THE HELICAL BLADE INSERTER BROKE. THERE WERE NO FRAGMENTS GENERATED AND NO FRAGMENTS REMAINED IN THE PATIENT. A DELAY OF 30 MINUTES HAS INCURRED AS THEY WAITED FOR ADDITIONAL INSTRUMENTATION TO ARRIVE SO THAT THE PROCEDURE TO THE LEFT FEMUR COULD BE COMPLETED. THE SURGERY WAS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY WITH NO HARM TO THE PATIENT. THIS REPORT IS 1 OF 2 FOR (B)(4). (B)(6). PRODUCT INVESTIGATION SUMMARY: THE COMPLAINT CONDITION FOR THE HELICAL BLADE INSERTER (PART 357.372 / LOT 6978417) AND HELICAL BLADE COUPLING SCREW (PART 357.377 / LOT 4509697) WAS LIKELY CAUSED BY NUMEROUS YEARS OF USE AND POSSIBLY EXCESSIVE OR MISPLACED HAMMERING DURING SURGERY. HOWEVER, THIS COMPLAINT IS NOT LIKELY A RESULT OF ANY DESIGN RELATED DEFICIENCY. THE HELICAL BLADE INSERTER AND THE HELICAL BLADE COUPLING SCREW ARE INSTRUMENTS ROUTINELY USED IN THE TITANIUM TROCHANTERIC FIXATION NAIL SYSTEM. THE DEVICES WERE BOTH RETURNED AND REPORTED TO HAVE BROKEN DURING SURGERY. THIS CONDITION IS CONFIRMED AS THE PROXIMAL KNURLED HEAD OF THE COUPLING SCREW HAS BROKEN OFF OF THE SHAFT AND THE THUMB SCREW ON THE ALIGNMENT INDICATOR OF THE HELICAL BLADE INSERTER HAS BROKEN AND FALLEN OUT OF THE DEVICE. IT IS LIKELY THAT NUMEROUS YEARS OF USE AND, POSSIBLY, EXCESSIVE OR MISPLACED HAMMERING DURING SURGERY HAVE LED TO THIS COMPLAINT CONDITION. THE COUPLING SCREW WAS MANUFACTURED IN DECEMBER, 2002 AND IS OVER THIRTEEN YEARS OLD. THE INSERTER WAS MANUFACTURED IN JULY, 2012 AND IS OVER THREE YEARS OLD. BOTH DEVICES ARE IN FAIRLY WORN CONDITION WITH SEVERAL MARKINGS INDICATIVE OF HAMMER STRIKES. THE ASSOCIATED DRAWINGS FOR BOTH DEVICES WERE REVIEWED AND DETERMINED TO BE SUITABLE FOR THEIR INTENDED DESIGN, APPLICATION, AND DIMENSIONAL CONFORMITY WHEN USED AS RECOMMENDED. THE CONDITION OF THE RETURNED DEVICES DOES AGREE WITH THE COMPLAINT DESCRIPTION. WHETHER THE COMPLAINT CONDITION FOR THESE DEVICES CAN BE REPLICATED IS NOT APPLICABLE FOR THIS CONDITION. DEVICE HISTORY RECORD REVIEW: RELEASE TO WAREHOUSE DATE: DECEMBER 10, 2002 - MANUFACTURED BY SYNTHES (B)(4). NO NON-CONFORMANCE REPORTS WERE GENERATED DURING PRODUCTION. REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD(S) SHOWED THAT THERE WERE NO ISSUES DURING THE MANUFACTURE OF THIS PRODUCT THAT WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THIS COMPLAINT CONDITION.

(B)(4). PER THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE (IFU), HYPOTENSION IS A POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE OVERALL TAVR PROCEDURE, INCLUDING VASCULAR AND APICAL ACCESS, USE OF ANGIOGRAPHY, BALLOON VALVULOPLASTY, USE OF CONSCIOUS SEDATION AND/OR GENERAL ANESTHESIA, AND THE BIO-PROSTHESIS IMPLANTATION. PATIENTS UNDERGOING THE TAVR PROCEDURE CAN BE NON-OPERATIVE OR HIGH RISK, HAVE COMPLEX MEDICAL HISTORIES AND MULTIPLE CO-MORBIDITIES. PATIENT RISK FACTORS FOR HYPOTENSION INCLUDE LOW EF, CAD, CHF, ARTERIOSCLEROSIS, HYPOVOLEMIA, AND ANEMIA. ADDITIONALLY, THESE PATIENTS ARE ROUTINELY ADMINISTERED MULTIPLE VASOACTIVE DRUGS DURING THE PROCEDURE AND ARE INTENTIONALLY MADE HYPOTENSIVE, UTILIZING RAPID VENTRICULAR PACING, TO FACILITATE ACCURATE VALVE DEPLOYMENT. AS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, INTRA-OPERATIVE HYPOTENSION IS NOT UNCOMMON AND IS TREATED WITH STANDARD THERAPIES, INCLUDING VASOACTIVE DRUGS. IT IS ALSO NOT UNCOMMON TO INITIATE BRIEF CHEST COMPRESSIONS OR CARDIAC MASSAGE TO FACILITATE DISTRIBUTION OF THESE VASOACTIVE DRUGS. IN SOME CASES, THESE STANDARD MANEUVERS ARE NOT ADEQUATE, AND INITIATION OF CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS (CPB), INSERTION OF IABP, AND/OR CONVERSION TO OPEN SURGERY IS REQUIRED. PHYSICIANS ARE EXTENSIVELY TRAINED BY EDWARDS BEFORE THEY ARE QUALIFIED TO USE THE TRANSCATHETER HEART VALVE (THV). TRAINING INCLUDES PATIENT SCREENING, DEVICE PREPARATION, APPROACH, DEPLOYMENT, IMAGING, PROCEDURE-SPECIFIC TRAINING MANUALS AND PROCTORED PROCEDURES. AS A PRECAUTION, THE THV TRAINING MANUALS INSTRUCT THE OPERATOR TO 1) MINIMIZE THE NUMBER AND DURATION OF RAPID BURST PACING EPISODES, AND 2) ALLOW SUFFICIENT HEMODYNAMIC RECOVERY BEFORE INITIATING ANOTHER EPISODE OF RAPID PACING. IN THIS CASE, THE EXACT CAUSE OF THE PATIENT?S HEMODYNAMIC INSTABILITY CANNOT BE CONFIRMED. HOWEVER, IN ADDITION TO THE PROCEDURE ITSELF, PATIENT FACTORS (TRIPLE VALVE DISEASE, LOW EF) MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE HEMODYNAMIC INSTABILITY AND THE PATIENT?S SUBSEQUENT DEATH. THE IFU AND TRAINING MANUALS HAVE BEEN REVIEWED AND NO INADEQUACIES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED WITH REGARDS TO WARNINGS, CONTRAINDICATIONS, AND THE DIRECTIONS/CONDITIONS FOR THE SUCCESSFUL USE OF THE DEVICE. COMPLAINT HISTORIES FOR ALL REPORTED EVENTS ARE REVIEWED AGAINST TRENDING CONTROL LIMITS ON A MONTHLY BASIS, AND ANY EXCURSIONS ABOVE THE CONTROL LIMITS ARE ASSESSED AND DOCUMENTED AS PART OF THIS MONTHLY REVIEW. NO CORRECTIVE OR PREVENTATIVE ACTIONS ARE REQUIRED. DURING A TRANSFEMORAL TAVR PROCEDURE, BALLOON AORTIC VALVULOPLASTY (BAV) WAS PERFORMED WITH A 22X4 EDWARDS BAV CATHETER TO DETERMINE THE REQUIRED VALVE SIZE. THE PATIENT WAS PACED AT 180PPM AND BAV WAS PERFORMED. THE PATIENT'S PRESSURE DROPPED TO 50 MMHG. MEDICATIONS WERE PROVIDED UNTIL THE PRESSURE WAS 100 MMHG SYSTOLIC. THE PATIENT WAS THEN PACED AT 180PPM AND A 23MM SAPIEN 3 VALVE WAS DEPLOYED AT A FINAL 80:20 AORTIC/VENTRICULAR (A/V) POSITION. NO PARAVALVULAR LEAK (PVL) WAS OBSERVED POST DEPLOYMENT. THE TEMPORARY PACER WAS TURNED OFF AND THE DELIVERY SYSTEM WAS REMOVED. THE PATIENT'S PRESSURE REMAINED AT 45 MMHG. THE PATIENT WAS PLACED ON BYPASS FOR SUPPORT AND TRANSFERRED TO THE RECOVERY UNIT. IT WAS REPORTED THAT POST PROCEDURE, THE PATIENT REQUIRED DEFIBRILLATION AND CPR. MILD PVL WAS OBSERVED AFTER CPR WAS PERFORMED. IT WAS BELIEVED THAT THE CPR CRUSHED THE VALVE. THE PATIENT EXPIRED WITHIN 24 HOURS OF THE PROCEDURE. THE EXACT CAUSE OF DEATH HAS NOT BEEN PROVIDED AT THE TIME OF THIS REPORT.|1457

RED HEART ALARMS REPORTEDLY SOUNDED WHEN THE PATIENT WAS SUPPORTED BY THE POWER MODULE (WITH A GROUNDED PATIENT CABLE) AND THE PATIENT BECAME LIGHTHEADED AND EXPERIENCED DIZZINESS. NO ALARMS OCCURRED WHILE THE PATIENT WAS ON BATTERY SUPPORT. A SYSTEM CONTROLLER LOG FILE WAS SUBMITTED FOR EVALUATION AND IT'S ANALYSIS BY A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE MANUFACTURER'S TECHNICAL SERVICES TEAM FOUND TWO PUMP STOPPAGE EVENTS. THE TECHNICAL SERVICES REPRESENTATIVE ARRIVED ON SITE ON (B)(6) 2015 TO EVALUATE THE LEAD AND AGAIN REVIEWED THE SYSTEM CONTROLLER LOG FILE. NO ADDITIONAL PUMP STOPPAGES WERE RECORDED; HOWEVER, THE LOG FILE REVIEW FOUND FREQUENT POWER CABLE DISCONNECT EVENTS. THE PATIENT WAS REPORTEDLY LYING IN BED WHEN THE FIRST PUMP STOPPAGE EVENT OCCURRED A FEW WEEKS AGO. THE PATIENT REPORTED THAT IT TOOK APPROXIMATELY TWO MINUTES TO SWITCH POWER SOURCES DUE TO BEING LEGALLY BLIND AND HAVING HAND TREMORS. DURING THE SECOND PUMP STOPPAGE EVENT, THE PATIENT REPORTEDLY HEARD A RED HEART AND A POWER CABLE DISCONNECT ALARM. ALTHOUGH THE LOG FILE INDICATED THAT THERE WERE DOUBLE POWER CABLE DISCONNECTS, THE PATIENT SWORE THAT BOTH POWER CABLES WERE CONNECTED DURING THE ALARMS. THE PATIENT REPORTEDLY HEARD POWER CABLE DISCONNECT ALARMS DURING THE EVENT AND WAS CONFUSED BY THEM. THE SYSTEM CONTROLLER WAS EXCHANGED AND IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PATIENT SEEMED FINE AND HAS EXPERIENCED NO FURTHER ALARMS SINCE SWITCHING TO THE NEW SYSTEM CONTROLLER WHILE SUPPORTED BY THE POWER MODULE, STILL CONNECTED TO A GROUNDED PATIENT CABLE. IT WAS RECOMMENDED FOR THE PATIENT TO UPGRADE FROM EPC SYSTEM CONTROLLERS TO PC SYSTEM CONTROLLERS FOR THE PATIENT'S SAFETY AS THE PATIENT'S VISION AND DEXTERITY CONTINUES TO WORSEN. DEVICE UNIQUE IDENTIFIER (UDI) - DEVICE WAS MANUFACTURED PRIOR TO UDI LABELING IMPLEMENTATION. APPROXIMATE AGE OF DEVICE - 4 YEAR AND 4 MONTHS. THE REPORT OF RED HEART ALARMS AND A TOTAL LOSS OF EXTERNAL POWER WAS CONFIRMED BASED ON THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE LOG FILE RETRIEVED FROM THE RETURNED SYSTEM CONTROLLER. HOWEVER, THE INVESTIGATION WAS UNABLE TO ATTRIBUTE THE RETURNED SYSTEM CONTROLLER TO THE ALARMS. THE RETURNED SYSTEM CONTROLLER WAS FUNCTIONALLY TESTED AND EXERCISED WHILE CONNECTED TO THE EQUIPMENT IN THE LABORATORY AND WAS FOUND TO FUNCTION AS INTENDED DURING THE ANALYSIS EVENT WHILE SUPPORTED INDEPENDENTLY BY EITHER POWER LEAD. A REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORDS REVEALED NO DEVIATIONS FROM MANUFACTURING OR QUALITY ASSURANCE SPECIFICATIONS. THE MANUFACTURER IS CLOSING THE FILE ON THIS EVENT.|1599

THE DHR SHOWS THAT THE PRODUCT WAS ASSEMBLED AND INSPECTED ACCORDING TO SPECIFICATIONS. ONE UNIT OF CATALOG NUMBER 311403 (BREATH CIRC, ANES, ADULT, EXP 0.5-1.8M W/EX) WAS RECEIVED FOR ANALYSIS. IT WAS VISUALLY INSPECTED AND A ""SHORT SHOT"" WAS FOUND ON THE EXTENSION TUBE. WHAT THE CUSTOMER IS REPORTING AS A ""CRACK IN THE EXTENSION TUBE"" IS ACTUALLY A ""SHORT SHOT"". FUNCTIONAL TESTING WAS PERFORMED ON THE CIRCUIT AND THE SAMPLE PASSED THE TEST. LEAK TESTING WAS ALSO PERFORMED ON THE EXTENSION TUBE. THE SAMPLE FAILED THE LEAK TEST DUE TO THE ""SHORT SHOT"" ON THE CORRUGATED TUBE. AS AN ADDITIONAL TEST, THE EXTENSION TUBE OF THE SAMPLE WAS IMMERSED UNDER WATER TO IDENTIFY WHERE THE LEAK CAME FROM. IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE LEAK CAME FROM THE ""SHORT SHOT"" ON THE CORRUGATED TUBING. OTHER REMARKS: BASED ON THE INVESTIGATION PERFORMED, THE REPORTED COMPLAINT WAS CONFIRMED. A SHORT SHOT WAS FOUND ON THE EXTENSION TUBE. A ROOT CAUSE COULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED AT THIS TIME. (B)(4) HAS BEEN ISSUED TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. A CONCLUSION CODE COULD NOT BE CHOSEN AS THE COMPLAINT WAS CONFIRMED; HOWEVER, A ROOT CAUSE COULD NOT BE ESTABLISHED."|1135

(B)(4). DATE SENT: 1/4/2016. WHEN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS RECEIVED AND/OR THE DEVICE ANALYSIS HAS BEEN COMPLETED, A SUPPLEMENTAL MEDWATCH WILL BE SENT. (B)(4). ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: BATCH # M92D1T . THE ER320 DEVICE WAS RETURNED FOR ANALYSIS AND UPON INSPECTION THE JAWS WERE FOUND TO BE IN A YIELDED CONDITION. IN AN ATTEMPT TO REPLICATE THE REPORTED INCIDENT THE DEVICE WAS FUNCTIONALLY EVALUATED. UPON FIRING OF THE DEVICE, 6 CLIPS WERE FORMED WITH GAP DUE TO THE CONDITION OF THE JAWS AND 5 CONFORMING CLIPS; FINALLY THE INSTRUMENT LOCKED OUT AS INTENDED. POSSIBLE CAUSES FOR THE FOUND CONDITION OF THE YIELDED JAWS MAY BE IF THE DEVICE IS CLOSED OVER AN EXISTING HARD OBJECT OR CLIP PLACING STRESS ON THE JAWS CAUSING THEM TO DISTORT OR YIELD AND NOT RETURN TO THEIR ORIGINAL DIMENSIONS/POSITION OR EXCESSIVE APPLICATION OF TORQUE TO THE JAWS WHEN POSITIONING THE DEVICE ON A VESSEL. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT AS PART OF OUR QUALITY PROCESS, EACH DEVICE IS VISUALLY INSPECTED AND FUNCTIONALLY TESTED DURING MANUFACTURING TO ENSURE THE DEVICE MEETS THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS PRIOR TO SHIPMENT. IT IS KNOWN FROM THE HISTORY OF THE DEVICE THAT THE CONDITION OF THE JAWS MAY LEAD DROPPING/EJECTED CLIPS. A BATCH RECORD REVIEW WAS PERFORMED AND NO ANOMALIES WERE FOUND DURING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING AN UNKNOWN PROCEDURE, THE CLIPS CAME OUT CROSSED. THEY GOT ANOTHER CLIPPER AND COMPLETED THE CASE WITH NO ISSUES. THERE WERE NO PATIENT CONSEQUENCES REPORTED.|2579
DURING REMOVAL OF THE COMMANDER DELIVERY SYSTEM THROUGH THE ESHEATH, THERE WAS EXCESSIVE RESISTANCE FELT. UNDER FLUOROSCOPY, THE BALLOON APPEARED OUTSIDE OF THE CENTER OF THE SHEATH AND APPEARED CAUGHT IN THE SEAM WHERE IT IS SPLIT. WITH SOME MANIPULATION OF THE DEVICE, THE POSITION OF THE DELIVERY SYSTEM APPEARED TO BE COAXIAL WITH THE ESHEATH AND THE DELIVERY SYSTEM WAS ABLE TO BE REMOVED USING ADDITIONAL FORCE. THE BALLOON WAS TORN FROM THE DELIVERY SYSTEM AND APPEARED TO BE INVERTED. THERE WAS NO CONSEQUENCE TO THE PATIENT. THE COMMANDER DELIVERY SYSTEM WAS RETURNED TO EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES FOR EVALUATION. UPON VISUAL INSPECTION IT WAS OBSERVED THERE WAS COMPLETE SEPARATION OF THE INFLATION BALLOON FROM THE CRIMP BALLOON PROXIMAL TO THE BOND, THE CRIMP TO INFLATION BALLOON BOND REMAINED INTACT AND THE BALLOON FOLDED OVER THE NOSE TIP, LIKELY DUE TO WITHDRAWAL ATTEMPTS OF THE DELIVERY SYSTEM BALLOON INTO THE SHEATH. THE CRIMP BALLOON DOUBLE WALL THICKNESS WAS MEASURED AND FOUND TO MEET SPECIFICATION. DUE TO THE BALLOON TEAR, FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS WAS NOT POSSIBLE. NO MANUFACTURING NON-CONFORMANCES COULD BE IDENTIFIED. A REVIEW OF DHR, COMPLAINT HISTORY ANALYSIS, AND MANUFACTURING MITIGATIONS DID NOT REVEAL ANY INDICATIONS THAT A MANUFACTURING NON-CONFORMANCE OF THE DELIVERY SYSTEM OF SHEATH WAS THE SOURCE OF THE COMPLAINT. BASED ON THE INVESTIGATION, TWO FACTORS WERE IDENTIFIED THAT MAY HAVE PREVENTED THE DELIVERY SYSTEM FROM WITHDRAWING INTO OR THROUGH THE SHEATH: NON-AXIAL ALIGNMENT DURING RETRIEVAL CAN CAUSE RESISTANCE RETRIEVING THE DELIVERY SYSTEM FLEX TIP OR BALLOON INTO THE SHEATH; AND RESIDUAL LIQUID VOLUME IN THE DELIVERY SYSTEM DURING RETRIEVAL CAN ALSO RESULT IN RESISTANCE RETRIEVING THE DELIVERY SYSTEM INTO (AND THROUGH) THE SHEATH. CONSEQUENTLY WHILE OVERCOMING THESE PROCEDURAL FACTORS, IF ADDITIONAL TENSILE FORCE AND MANIPULATION IS REQUIRED TO WITHDRAW THE DELIVERY SYSTEM INTO (AND THROUGH) THE SHEATH, IT COULD RESULT IN MATERIAL FAILURE (CRIMP/INFLATION BALLOON BOND), WHICH WAS OBSERVED DURING THE ENGINEERING EVALUATION. WHILE A DEFINITIVE ROOT CAUSE WAS UNABLE TO BE DETERMINED, AVAILABLE INFORMATION SUPPORTS THAT PROCEDURAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED COMPLAINT. THE COMPLAINT WAS CONFIRMED, BUT NO MANUFACTURING NON-CONFORMITIES WERE FOUND IN THE RETURNED SAMPLE. AVAILABLE INFORMATION SUPPORTS THAT PROCEDURAL FACTORS (NON-AXIAL ALIGNMENT DURING RETRIEVAL OR RESIDUAL LIQUID VOLUME IN THE DELIVERY SYSTEM) CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED EVENT. NO LABELING OR IFU INADEQUACIES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND REVIEW OF COMPLAINT HISTORY REVEAL THAT THE OCCURRENCE RATE DOES NOT EXCEED THE DECEMBER 2015 CONTROL LIMITS FOR THIS TREND CATEGORY. THEREFORE, NO CORRECTIVE OR PREVENTATIVE ACTION IS REQUIRED AT THIS TIME.|3024

IT WAS REPORTED BY (B)(6) THAT DURING SERVICE AND EVALUATION, IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE MOTOR DEVICE CABLE/CORD/WIRING WAS DAMAGED AND THE CONTROLLER HAD A CRACK IN THE HOSE. IT WAS NOTED IN THE SERVICE ORDER THAT THE DEVICE DID NOT WORK AT ALL. THIS EVENT DID NOT OCCUR DURING SURGERY. THERE WAS NO PATIENT INVOLVEMENT. THERE WERE NO REPORTS OF INJURIES, MEDICAL INTERVENTION OR PROLONGED HOSPITALIZATION. THE EXACT DATE OF THIS EVENT WAS UNKNOWN. ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION HAS BEEN DISCLOSED. IF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SHOULD BECOME AVAILABLE, A SUPPLEMENTAL MEDWATCH REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED ACCORDINGLY. (B)(6). THIS DEVICE WAS RETURNED FOR SERVICE; HOWEVER, DID NOT MEET MANUFACTURING SPECIFICATIONS DURING PRE-REPAIR ASSESSMENT. RELIABILITY ENGINEERING EVALUATED THE DEVICE AND THE REPORTED CONDITION OF THE DEVICE DID NOT WORK AT ALL WAS NOT CONFIRMED. HOWEVER, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE MOTOR AND CONTROL WERE DEFECTIVE; AND THE CONTROLLER HAD A CRACK IN THE HOSE (CORD) DUE TO WEAR FROM NORMAL USE AND SERVICING. IF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SHOULD BECOME AVAILABLE, A SUPPLEMENTAL MEDWATCH REPORT WILL BE SENT ACCORDINGLY. THE SERIAL NUMBER WAS INADVERTENTLY RECORDED IN THE LOT NUMBER FIELD ON THE INITIAL REPORT. THE SERIAL NUMBER HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE CORRECT FIELD ACCORDINGLY. IF INFORMATION IS OBTAINED THAT WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE INITIAL MEDWATCH, A FOLLOW-UP MEDWATCH WILL BE FILED AS APPROPRIATE.|1069
THE CONSUMER REPORTED THE IMPLANTABLE NEUROSTIMULATOR (INS) WAS NOT KEEPING A CHARGE. IT WAS NOT CHARGING LIKE IT USED TO SINCE JULY 2015. THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDER (HCP) STATED IT WOULD LAST ONLY 5 YEARS AND SUGGESTED THE INS NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE PATIENT WAS CHARGING TOO OFTEN. THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDER (HCP) INSTRUCTED THE PATIENT TO CALL THE MANUFACTURER SINCE THE SURGEON WHO IMPLANTED IT WAS NO LONGER THERE. AT FIRST THE PATIENT THOUGHT SHE MIGHT NOT BE CHARGING LONG ENOUGH. NOW SHE CHARGED IT TO 100% EVERY SUNDAY. THE PATIENT STATED SHE ALWAYS GOT 8 COUPLING BARS. IT HAPPENED A FEW TIMES THAT IT WOULD NOT CHARGE AT ALL. WHEN ASKED TO CLARIFY, THE PATIENT EXPLAINED SHE MEANT IT FELT LIKE THE INS DID NOT HOLD A CHARGE. THE PATIENT WOULD LIKE TO REPLACE THE IMPLANTABLE NEUROSTIMULATOR (INS) THIS YEAR BECAUSE SHE WOULD GET BETTER INSURANCE COVERAGE. IT WAS NOTED THE PAIN CAME BACK REALLY BAD IN (B)(6) 2015. THE PATIENT WAS NOT SURE IF IT WAS RELATED TO HER LOSING WEIGHT. THE PATIENT SAID HER INS WAS A HUGE BATTERY AND THAT THE NEWER ONES WERE SMALLER AND MAYBE SHE SHOULD SWITCH OUT. GRADUALLY IN 2014, THE PATIENT STARTED LOSING WEIGHT. HER INS KIND OF POPPED OUT, THE TOP OF IT, WHEN SHE SAT DOWN. THE PATIENT WONDERED IF THE RECHARGING BELT COULD BE THE REASON THE IMPLANTABLE NEUROSTIMULATOR (INS) WAS NOT HOLDING THE CHARGE. RELEVANT MEDICAL HISTORY INCLUDED OTHER CHRONIC INTRACTABLE PAIN IN THE TRUNK OR LIMBS. NO INTERVENTIONS OR OUTCOME WERE REPORTED REGARDING THIS EVENT. FURTHER FOLLOW-UP IS BEING CONDUCTED TO OBTAIN THIS INFORMATION. IF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS RECEIVED, A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WILL BE SENT. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM THE CONSUMER REPORTED THE UNIT WAS REPLACED TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE. THE PATIENT NOTED THE NEWER UNIT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER IN BOTH CIRCUMFERENCE AND THICKNESS AND WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING ABLE TO DO MORE ACTIVITIES WHEN HE WAS DONE RECOVERING. THE PATIENT HAD BEEN IN PAIN DUE TO THE MALFUNCTION AND THE MANUFACTURER'S REPRESENTATIVE AND HEALTHCARE PROVIDER (HCP) WERE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE PATIENT SO THEY COULD PERFORM THE SURGERY (B)(6). THEY BOTH CALLED EVERY DAY TO CHECK UP ON RECOVERY. JUST THE DAY BEFORE THE PATIENT SENT THE LETTER, HE WAS IN EXTREME PAIN AND THEY CAME IN TO SEE THE PATIENT. SINCE 2009, THE MANUFACTURER HAD ELIMINATED THE PATIENT'S NERVE PAIN AND GAVE THE PATIENT HIS LIFE BACK.|2885
THE ONLY PARAMETERS IMPACTED BY THE MALFUNCTION IN THIS EVENT WERE RETIC RESULTS. ERRONEOUS RETIC RESULTS DO NOT POSE A RISK FOR DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY. THE FIELD SERVICE ENGINEER (FSE) EVALUATED THE INSTRUMENT ON (B)(4) 2015. THE FSE REPLACED THE I-BEAM TUBING FROM THE RETIC STAIN REAGENT PUMP, PM5. THE REPAIRS WERE VERIFIED PER ESTABLISHED SERVICE PROCEDURES. (B)(4). THE CUSTOMER OBSERVED A FLUID LEAK FROM A COULTER LH 780 HEMATOLOGY ANALYZER. THE VOLUME OF THE LEAK WAS NOT SPECIFIED. THE LEAK WAS NOT CONTAINED WITHIN THE INSTRUMENT AND RETIC VOTEOUTS MESSAGES WERE REPORTED BY THE CUSTOMER AT THE TIME OF THE OCCURRENCE. THE FIELD SERVICE ENGINEER, FSE, WAS WEARING PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT CONSISTING OF A LABORATORY COAT, GOGGLES AND GLOVES AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT AND THERE WAS NO REPORT OF INJURY OR DIRECT EXPOSURE TO THE LEAK. ERRONEOUS PATIENT RESULTS WERE NOT GENERATED AND THERE WAS NO CHANGE OR AFFECT TO PATIENT TREATMENT IN CONNECTION WITH THIS EVENT.|1250
(B)(6) THE PATIENT?S EXACT WEIGHT WAS REPORTED AS (B)(6). DEVICE IS AN INSTRUMENT AND IS NOT IMPLANTED OR EXPLANTED. SUBJECT DEVICE HAS BEEN RECEIVED; NO CONCLUSIONS COULD BE DRAWN AS THE DEVICE IS ENTERING THE COMPLAINT SYSTEM. DEVICE HISTORY RECORD REVIEW: MANUFACTURING LOCATION: (B)(4) - MANUFACTURING DATE: MARCH 12, 2008. NO NON-CONFORMANCE REPORTS WERE GENERATED DURING PRODUCTION. REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD(S) SHOWED THAT THERE WERE NO ISSUES DURING THE MANUFACTURE OF THE PRODUCT THAT WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THIS COMPLAINT CONDITION. DEVICE USED FOR TREATMENT, NOT DIAGNOSIS. IF INFORMATION IS OBTAINED THAT WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE INITIAL MEDWATCH, A FOLLOW-UP MEDWATCH WILL BE FILED AS APPROPRIATE. IT WAS REPORTED THAT A REAMER TIP BROKE WHILE PERFORMING A DYNAMIC HIP SCREW (DHS) REVISION SURGERY ON (B)(6) 2015. DURING THE PROCEDURE, THE INTACT PLATE AND ALL OF THE SCREW FRAGMENTS WERE REMOVED. AS THE SURGEON WAS REMOVING THE BROKEN SCREWS, THE TIP OF THE HOLLOW REAMER BROKE OFF. THE REAMER FRAGMENTS WERE EASILY RETRIEVED USING FORCEPS; NO ADDITIONAL INTERVENTION OR UNANTICIPATED X-RAYS WERE REQUIRED. AFTER THE REAMER BROKE, THE SURGEON UTILIZED OTHER READILY AVAILABLE DEVICES TO REMOVE THE SCREW FRAGMENTS AND COMPLETE THE PROCEDURE WITHOUT DELAY THIS REPORT WILL ADDRESS THE INTRAOPERATIVE EVENTS ONLY. THE REASON FOR THE REVISION WILL BE CAPTURED IN AND REPORTED UNDER (B)(4). THIS REPORT IS 1 OF 1 FOR (B)(4). A PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT INVESTIGATION WAS PERFORMED FOR THE SUBJECT DEVICE (SPARE REAMER TUBE FOR HOLLOW REAMER, PART NUMBER 309.450, LOT 325754). THE SUBJECT DEVICE WAS RECEIVED WITH THE COMPLAINT CONDITION ?TIP BROKEN INTRAOPERATIVELY.? THE DEVICE WAS RECEIVED WITH A MISSING PORTION AT THE DISTAL TIP. THE BREAK EXTENDS FROM THE DISTAL TIP TO THE 3.5MM HOLE. THE THREE REMAINING CUTTING TEETH EACH SHOW SIGNIFICANT SCRAPING. THE FRACTURE SITES WERE EXAMINED AND NO MATERIAL VOIDS OR IRREGULARITIES WERE IDENTIFIED. THE BALANCE IS IN WORKING CONDITION AND SHOWS WEAR CONSISTENT WITH USE. THUS, THE COMPLAINT CONDITION IS CONFIRMED AND CONSISTENT WITH THE REPORTED CONDITION. REPLICATION OF THE COMPLAINT CONDITION IS NOT APPLICABLE AS THE DEVICE IS ALREADY BROKEN. FURTHER EVALUATION SHOWS THAT THIS DEVICE IS A COMPONENT OF THE HOLLOW REAMER (309.450) AND ALSO AVAILABLE INDIVIDUALLY FOR REPLACEMENT. THIS HOLLOW REAMER IS INTENDED FOR USE IN THE REMOVAL OF BROKEN 4.0MM, 4.5MM, 4.9MM, AND 5.0MM SCREWS. IF THE BREAK IS LOCATED IT THE SHAFT, THE DEVICE IS ALSO APPROPRIATE FOR 6.5MM, 7.0MM, AND 7.3MM CANNULATED SCREWS. THIS INFORMATION IS PROVIDED PER THE SCREW REMOVAL SET TECHNIQUE GUIDE. A REVIEW OF THE CURRENT DESIGN DRAWING / MANUFACTURED REVISION WAS PERFORMED. THE DESIGN HISTORY WAS FOUND TO NOT IMPACT THE COMPLAINT CONDITION. DURING THE INVESTIGATION NO PRODUCT DESIGN ISSUES OR DISCREPANCIES WERE OBSERVED THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE COMPLAINT CONDITION. THE RETURNED PART WAS DETERMINED TO BE SUITABLE FOR THE INTENDED USE WHEN EMPLOYED AND MAINTAINED AS RECOMMENDED. A ROOT CAUSE CANNOT BE DEFINITIVELY DETERMINED AS THE CIRCUMSTANCES AT THE TIME OF THE BREAK AND THE MAINTENANCE OF THE DEVICE OVERS IT?S APPROXIMATELY 6.5 YEAR LIFESPAN ARE UNKNOWN. HOWEVER, THE CONDITION IS CONSISTENT WITH HAVING BEEN SUBJECTED TO EXTENSIVE FORCES OUTSIDE OF RECOMMENDED USAGE, SUCH AS OFF-AXIS USE AND/OR IMPACT WITH THE DISTAL TIP. THUS, IT IS MOST PROBABLE THAT THE COMPLAINT CONDITION IS A RESULT OF THE METHOD OF USE/MAINTENANCE OVER THE DEVICES 6.5 YEAR LIFESPAN. DURING THE INVESTIGATION NO PRODUCT DESIGN ISSUES OR DISCREPANCIES WERE OBSERVED THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE COMPLAINT CONDITION. IF INFORMATION IS OBTAINED THAT WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE INITIAL MEDWATCH, A FOLLOW-UP MEDWATCH WILL BE FILED AS APPROPRIATE.|1069
IT WAS REPORTED THAT AN UNSPECIFIED ONE-LINK PRODUCT DISCONNECTED FROM AN UNSPECIFIED J-LOOP EXTENSION SET. THIS WAS NOTED AFTER INJECTION OF CONTRAST INTO THE EXTENSION SET DURING A MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) SCAN. THE REPORTER STATED THAT THE INJECTION WAS PERFORMED WITHOUT REMOVING THE PATIENT FROM THE SCANNER. WHEN THE TECHNICIAN BEGAN THE SCAN, IT WAS NOTED THAT NO CONTRAST WAS APPEARING IN THE PATIENT'S BRAIN. THE PATIENT WAS REMOVED FROM THE SCANNER, AND THE DISCONNECTION WAS IDENTIFIED. THE REPORTER STATED THIS LED TO A LEAK OF CONTRAST ON THE PATIENT AND THE SHEETS. THE TECHNICIAN RECONNECTED THE DEVICE, AND REINJECTED THE CONTRAST. THERE WAS NO REPORT OF PATIENT INJURY OR MEDICAL INTERVENTION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.|1171
CUSTOMER COMPLAINS OF HIGH RESULTS. CUSTOMER STATES THAT HE FEELS PHYSICALLY FINE, DENIES THE NEED FOR MEDICAL ATTENTION. THE CUSTOMER'S EXPECTED BLOOD RESULTS ARE 103-113MG/DL FASTING. VERIFIED TEST STRIPS EXPIRE 07/31/2018. CONFIRMED CUSTOMER'S TEST STRIPS ARE BEING STORED PROPERLY AND OPENED VIAL DATE (B)(6) 2015. CUSTOMER PERFORMED A BACK TO BACK BLOOD TEST 136MG/DL AND 136MG/DL FASTING. REVIEWED METER MEMORY: (B)(6). MEMORY CONCERNS: TEST OVER TWO HUNDRED. CUSTOMER STATES THAT OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS HIS RESULTS ARE HIGHER THAN HIS NORMAL. CUSTOMER HAS HAD AN INCREASE IN HIS MEDICATION.|2457
INSERT WOULD NOT LOCK INTO THE TIBIA.|1069
A PRODUCT INVESTIGATION WAS COMPLETED: THE INVESTIGATION HAS SHOWN THAT THE FLEXIBLE SHAFT WAS BROKEN OFF AS COMPLAINED. THE FLEXIBLE SHAFT WAS RETURNED IN TWO BROKEN FRAGMENTS. ONE FRAGMENT WAS NOT SENT BACK FOR EVALUATION AND THEREFORE THE RELEVANT DIMENSIONS CANNOT BE VERIFIED. HOWEVER, THE REVIEW OF THE PRODUCTION HISTORY REVEALED THAT THIS ITEM WAS MANUFACTURED IN MAY 2010 IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL ESTABLISHED REQUIREMENTS. NO MANUFACTURING RELATED ISSUES THAT WOULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS COMPLAINT WERE FOUND. UNFORTUNATELY, WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DETERMINE THE EXACT CAUSE OF THIS FAILURE. IT IS LIKELY THAT TOO MUCH MECHANICAL FORCE HAD BEEN APPLIED DURING USE. NO MANUFACTURING RELATED FAILURE COULD BE DETECTED. DEVICE WAS USED FOR TREATMENT, NOT DIAGNOSIS. IF INFORMATION IS OBTAINED THAT WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE INITIAL MEDWATCH, A FOLLOW-UP MEDWATCH WILL BE FILED AS APPROPRIATE. DEVICE REPORT FROM SYNTHES (B)(4) REPORTS AN EVENT IN THE (B)(6) AS FOLLOWS: IT WAS REPORTED THAT A FLEXIBLE REAMER SHAFT WAS FOUND TO BE BROKEN DURING THE CLEANING PROCESS. THERE WAS NO SURGICAL OR PATIENT INVOLVEMENT. THIS REPORT IS 1 OF 1 FOR (B)(4).|1069
IT WAS REPORTED TO PHILIPS THAT THE DEVICE HAD ECG BIAS ERRORS IN THE STATUS LOG. THERE WAS NO PATIENT INVOLVEMENT.|2591
IT WAS REPORTED BY THE SITE THAT THIS PATIENT'S CONTROLLER HAD A RECESSED PIN.  THE CONTROLLER WAS EXCHANGED WITH NO EFFECT ON THE PATIENT.  INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING. ONE CONTROLLER WAS RETURNED FOR EVALUATION. VARIOUS ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED AND REVIEWED IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE DEVICE IN RELATION TO THE REPORTED EVENT. ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE REVEALED THAT THE DEVICE FAILED TO MEET SPECIFICATIONS; THE DEVICE FAILED VISUAL INSPECTION AS A RESULT OF A BENT PIN ON POWER SOURCE PS1 CONNECTOR. THE BENT PIN, INSIDE THE CONTROLLER PS1 CONNECTOR, PREVENTED THE BATTERY FROM MAKING A PROPER ELECTRICAL CONNECTION WHEN THE BATTERY WAS CONNECTED. THE CONFIRMED MALFUNCTION IS RELATED TO THE REPORTED EVENT. THE MOST LIKELY ROOT CAUSE OF THE REPORTED EVENT CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO A FORCED CONNECTION. HEARTWARE HAS OPENED AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. HEARTWARE WILL SUBMIT A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WHEN NEW FACTS ARISES WHICH MATERIALLY ALTERS INFORMATION SUBMITTED IN A PREVIOUS MDR REPORT.|765
THE DEVICE WAS RETURNED AND THE REPORTED MALFUNCTION WAS NOT REPLICATED OR CONFIRMED. THE DEVICE WAS PUT THROUGH EXTENSIVE TESTING WITHOUT DUPLICATING THE MALFUNCTION. THE DEVICE'S ECG BOARD WAS REPLACED AS A PRECAUTION.  THE DEVICE WAS RECERTIFIED AND RETURNED TO THE CUSTOMER. NO TREND IS ASSOCIATED WITH REPORTS OF THIS TYPE. COMPLAINANT ALLEGED THAT THE DURING A ROUTINE SHIFT CHECK BY A CLINICIAN, THE DEVICE DELIVERED 1 JOULE WHEN 30 JOULES WAS SELECTED. COMPLAINANT INDICATED THAT THERE WAS NO PATIENT INVOLVEMENT IN THE REPORTED MALFUNCTION.|2339

NO DEVICE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS REPORT WAS RECEIVED FOR EXAMINATION. THE RETAINED SAMPLES OF SMARTSET HV BONE CEMENT 40G, PC:3092040, LOT:3460305 WERE TESTED FOR DOUGH TIME, SETTING TIME, HANDLING CHARACTERISTICS AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES. THE FMEA AND IFU HAVE BOTH BEEN REVIEWED. IMPLANT LOOSENING IS A KNOWN RISK WITH THE USE OF BONE CEMENTS AND THE RISK IS HIGHLIGHTED IN BOTH DOCUMENTS. REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORDS DID NOT REVEAL ANY RELATED MANUFACTURING DEVIATIONS OR ANOMALIES ON THE PROVIDED PRODUCT AND LOT COMBINATION. BASED ON PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS THIS COMPLICATION OF JOINT REPLACEMENT IS UNLIKELY TO HAVE BEEN THE RESULT OF A DEVICE FAILING TO MEET REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. THE INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL BE RETAINED FOR POTENTIAL SERIES INVESTIGATIONS IF TRIGGERED BY TREND ANALYSIS, POST MARKET SURVEILLANCE, OR OTHER EVENTS WITHIN THE QUALITY SYSTEM. CORRECTIVE ACTION WAS NOT INDICATED. DEPUY CONSIDERS THE INVESTIGATION CLOSED AT THIS TIME.

(B)(4). THE DEVICE WAS RECEIVED AND THE EVALUATION IS COMPLETE. THIS IS AN ANCILLARY SERVICE EVENT. THE INCREASED INTRA-PERITONEAL VOLUME (IIPV) EVENT WAS IDENTIFIED THROUGH AN EVENT HISTORY LOG REVIEW. A SERVICE HISTORY REVIEW SHOWED NO FAILURES/PROBLEMS THAT WERE THE SAME AS, OR SIMILAR TO, THE REPORTED ISSUE. IN ADDITION, THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT THE PARTS REPLACED DURING SERVICING CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED ISSUE. UPON CONCLUSION OF THE INVESTIGATION, THE CAUSE WAS DETERMINED TO BE USE ERROR, TIDAL TOTAL ULTRAFILTRATION REMOVAL SET TOO LOW. THE HOMECHOICE APD SYSTEMS TRAINER?S GUIDE GIVES INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO SET THE TIDAL THERAPY SETTINGS. A REVIEW OF THE LABEL FOR THE PRODUCT FAMILY WILL BE CONDUCTED. SHOULD ADDITIONAL RELEVANT INFORMATION BECOME AVAILABLE, A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED. DURING EVALUATION OF A RETURNED HOMECHOICE DEVICE, ONE INCREASED INTRA-PERITONEAL VOLUME (IIPV) EVENT WAS IDENTIFIED WHICH OCCURRED IN THE THERAPY INITIATED ON (B)(6) 2015 AT 21:29:36.

IT WAS REPORTED THAT A MINICAP LEAKED IODINE. THE PATIENT STATED THAT THEY THE MINICAP LEAKED IODINE ABOUT A MINUTE AFTER SECURING IT TO THE TRANSFER SET. THE PATIENT DID NOT NOTICE ANY CRACKS OR DAMAGE TO THE MINICAP. THERE WAS NO PATIENT INJURY OR MEDICAL INTERVENTION INDICATED AT THE TIME OF THE REPORT. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE. (B)(4). MANUFACTURING DATE - 8/17/2015 - 8/21/2015. A BATCH REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED AND THERE WERE NO DEVIATIONS FOUND RELATED TO THIS REPORTED CONDITION DURING THE MANUFACTURE OF THIS LOT. THE DEVICE WAS NOT RETURNED; THEREFORE, A DEVICE ANALYSIS COULD NOT BE COMPLETED. SHOULD ADDITIONAL RELEVANT INFORMATION BECOME AVAILABLE, A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED.|1250
"A FOLLOW-UP MEDWATCH REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED UPON COMPLETION OF INVESTIGATION. ENGINEERING EVALUATION OF THE RETURNED DRIVER NOTED THAT THE SHEAR TORSIONAL FRACTURE OF THE DRIVER OCCURRED AT A SUBSTANTIAL DISTANCE FROM THE SHOULDER OF THE DRIVER (-.055""), INDICATING THAT THE DRIVER WAS ONLY PARTIALLY ENGAGED WITHIN THE SCREW AND THAT THE OUTER SLEEVE WAS MOST LIKELY NOT FULLY LOCKED DOWN WITHIN THE TULIP. THE OUTER SECURE SHAFT PUSHES DOWN ON THE CROSS-BAR OF THE DRIVER SHAFT WHEN FULLY THREADED DOWN, WHICH CAUSES THE DRIVER SHOULDER TO BOTTOM-OUT ON THE BONE SCREW. WHEN THIS BOTTOMS-OUT IT CREATES A FRICTION PLATE WITH THE BONE SCREW HEAD AND PROMOTES LOAD SHARING ACROSS THE ENTIRE ASSEMBLY. ADDITIONALLY, THE ASSOCIATED SCREW WAS PART OF A LOT MANUFACTURED PRIOR TO A DESIGN MODIFICATION OF THE REFORM PEDICLE SCREW, INITIATED PREVIOUSLY TO REDUCE THE INHERENT INSERTION TORQUE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ""WASH-OUT"" OF THE THREAD FORM. AN INSERTION TORQUE REDUCTION OF 8% WAS EXPERIENCED FOR THE 7.5MM X 45MM SCREW, AND A 38% REDUCTION FOR THE 60MM SCREW, WITH THE 50MM FALLING BETWEEN THAT RANGE. REVIEW OF MANUFACTURING HISTORY RECORDS FOUND THAT A TOTAL OF (B)(4) PIECES OF THIS LOT WERE RELEASED FOR DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN NOVEMBER OF 2014 AND FEBRUARY OF 2015 WITH NO DEVIATION OR ANOMALIES THAT WOULD RELATE TO THE REPORTED EVENT. A TWO-YEAR COMPLAINT HISTORY REVIEW FOUND A TOTAL OF 5 REPORTS OF TIP FRACTURE FOR THE REPORTED LOT. ALL BUT ONE OF THE PREVIOUS REPORTS WERE ATTRIBUTED TO USER ERROR. AS THE ROOT CAUSE IS ATTRIBUTED TO USER ERROR AND THERE HAS BEEN A PREVIOUS DESIGN IMPROVEMENT TO THE PEDICLE SCREWS, REDUCING THE TORQUE REQUIRED TO INSERT THE SCREW, NO FURTHER CORRECTIVE ACTION IS REQUIRED. IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING A PROCEDURE PERFORMED ON OR AROUND (B)(6) 2015, THE TIP OF THE REFORM POLYAXIAL DRIVER (39-SP-0700) BROKE WHILE IMPLANTING A REFORM 7.5 X 50MM POLYAXIAL PEDICLE SCREW. THE POLYAXIAL SCREW WAS REMOVED AND REPLACED WITH ANOTHER DRIVER THAT WAS READILY AVAILABLE IN THE SET, AND NO DELAY TO THE PROCEDURE."|1069
IT WAS REPORTED THAT A SYSTEM ERROR 2240 (AIR IN SET/LINE) ALARM OCCURRED DURING DWELL THREE OF FOUR OF PERITONEAL DIALYSIS THERAPY ON THE HOMECHOICE. THE PATIENT WAS CONNECTED AT THE TIME OF THE ALARM. THERE WAS NOTHING FOUND DURING TROUBLESHOOTING THAT COULD HAVE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED ALARM. THE TECHNICAL SERVICES REPRESENTATIVE ASSISTED THE PATIENT IN ENDING THERAPY AND REVIEWED PROPER PROCEDURES WITH THE PATIENT. THE PATIENT PLANNED TO COMPLETE THERAPY USING MANUAL SUPPLIES. THERE WAS NO PATIENT INJURY OR MEDICAL INTERVENTION REPORTED. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.|2591
ACCORDING TO THE REPORTER: DURING A LAPAROSCOPIC NEPHRECTOMY PROCEDURE, DURING SURGERY OF RENAL URETER, THE FLEXURE PART OF THE DEVICE WAS DAMAGED AND FELL INTO THE CAVITY. THE PART WAS RETRIEVED.

A SUPPLEMENTAL WILL BE SUBMITTED UPON RECEIPT OF ANY NEW INFORMATION EVALUATION SUMMARY: POST MARKET VIGILANCE (PMV) LED AN EVALUATION OF ONE DEVICE OPENED BY THE ACCOUNT. THIS EVALUATION WAS BASED ON A TECHNICAL REVIEW OF ALL DATA RECEIVED FROM THE SITE, A PMV REVIEW OF MANUFACTURING RECORDS, A PMV REVIEW OF COMPLAINT TRENDS, ENGINEERING REVIEW OF THE PRODUCT AND AN EVALUATION OF THE RETURNED DEVICE. THE CLEVIS PIECES WERE DISENGAGED FROM THE SIDE OF THE INSTRUMENT. THE PIECES WERE RECEIVED IN A SMALL PACKAGE. NO OTHER VISUAL ABNORMALITIES WERE OBSERVED. THE ARTICULATION KNOB FUNCTIONED PROPERLY. THE KNOB TO EXPAND THE BLADES FUNCTIONED PROPERLY; THE BLADES COULD BE EXPANDED FULLY. A REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD INDICATES THIS DEVICE LOT NUMBER WAS RELEASED MEETING ALL QUALITY RELEASE SPECIFICATIONS AT THE TIME OF MANUFACTURE. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE COMPLAINT DATA DID NOT DISPLAY AN INCREASED TREND. ENGINEERING DETERMINED THAT REPLICATION OF THE REPORTED CONDITION MAY OCCUR AS A RESULT OF THE INSTRUMENT BEING FORCED BEYOND IT INDICATED USE. SHOULD NEW INFORMATION BECOME AVAILABLE, THE FILE WILL BE RE-OPENED AND THE INVESTIGATION SUMMARY WILL BE AMENDED AS APPROPRIATE.|1069

INFORMATION WAS RECEIVED FROM THE CONSUMER REGARDING A PATIENT WHO WAS IMPLANTED WITH AN IMPLANTABLE NEUROSTIMULATOR (INS) FOR PARKINSON'S DUAL AND MOVEMENT DISORDERS. IT WAS REPORTED THE PATIENT'S CONDITION HAD WORSENED SINCE HAVING THE DEEP BRAIN STIMULATOR (DBS) IMPLANTED. THE PATIENT WAS EXPERIENCING SYMPTOMS HE HAD NEVER HAD BEFORE SUCH AS DYSKINESIA AND THE PATIENT WAS NOT ABLE TO WALK (THEY WERE USING A WALKER). THE PATIENT HAD A RETURN OF TREMORS. THEY FELT THE DBS WAS AN ACCELERANT RATHER THAN AN AID. THREE DAYS AFTER IMPLANT THE PATIENT HAD PASSED OUT AND HAD TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL BUT THEY WERE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE DBS DEVICE. THE PATIENT HAD TO SPEND A MONTH IN A REHABILITATION CENTER TO LEARN THE BASIC COGNITIVE SKILLS (I.E. FEEDING, WALKING, ETC.). IT WAS A SUDDEN CHANGE AND THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THE EVENT. THEIR DOCTOR HAD TRIED SEVERAL THINGS LIKE REPROGRAMMING THEM AND TAKING THE PATIENT OFF OF CERTAIN MEDICATIONS TO SEE IF THEIR CONDITION WOULD IMPROVE BUT NOTHING HAD HELPED. THE DOCTOR WAS CONSIDERING TURNING THE DBS OFF TO SEE HOW THE PATIENT REACTS TO THAT. THEY WERE GOING TO SEE THEIR HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL (HCP) THE FOLLOWING WEEK AFTER REPORT. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WAS RECEIVED FROM A PATIENT. IT WAS REPORTED THAT IN AN ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE THE PREVIOUS REPORTED SYMPTOMS, REPROGRAMMING WAS PERFORMED BUT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. THE PATIENT?S WIFE REPORTED THAT SHE DOESN?T THINK THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE DEVICE, BUT RATHER WHERE THE LEADS WERE PLACED; AN X-RAY WAS PERFORMED AND CONFIRMED THAT THE LEADS WERE FINE. IT WAS NOTED THAT THE PATIENT?S FACE WAS BECOMING NON-EXPRESSIVE. DURING AN OFFICE VISIT ON (B)(6) 2015, STIMULATION WAS TURNED OFF FOR 30 MINUTES AND AFTERWARDS, THE PATIENT WAS ABLE TO STAND ON HIS OWN AND WALK IN THE HALLWAY JUST FINE. THE PATIENT?S AFFECT RETURNED TO NORMAL AND HE IS WELL CONTROLLED ON ORAL MEDICATIONS. IF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS RECEIVED, A FOLLOW-UP REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED. A CONSUMER LATER REPORTED THAT THE STIMULATION HELPED WITH THE PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS. WHEN STIMULATION WAS ON THE PATIENT'S COGNITIVE SKILLS SUFFER AND THE PATIENT GETS REALLY FRUSTRATED. THE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL HAD TOLD THE PATIENT TO TURN STIMULATION OFF. STIMULATION WAS TURNED OFF ON (B)(6) 2015, ONCE STIMULATION WAS TURNED OFF EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT FOR A FEW DAYS. THE PATIENT HAD SYMPTOMS CONTROLLED AND WAS ABLE TO USE COGNITIVE SKILLS. WITH THE STIMULATION OFF THE PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS HAD GRADUALLY RETURNED. THE PATIENT HAD SYMPTOMS OF SEVERE TREMOR, FREEZING, AND DYSKINESIA RETURN AND THEY WERE NOW WORSE THAN PRIOR TO IMPLANT. THIS WAS ALSO NOTED TO BE POSSIBLY DUE TO DISEASE PROGRESSION. THE PATIENT HAD SPOKEN WITH THEIR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL WHO HAD SUGGESTED TURNING STIMULATION BACK ON TO SEE HOW IT WORKED AT CONTROLLING SYMPTOMS. THE PATIENT'S SPOUSE TYPICALLY RAN THE PROGRAMMER AND DID NOT WANT THE PATIENT TO TURN STIMULATION BACK ON. ONSET DATE WAS (B)(6) 2013 AND THE CHANGE IN STIMULATION/THERAPY HAD BEEN GRADUAL. PATIENT HAD NOT RECEIVED A THERAPY GUIDE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RECEIVED REPORTED THE PATIENT HAD NO PLANS TO TURN THEIR DEEP BRAIN STIMULATOR BACK ON. THE PATIENT WAS SO MUCH BETTER COGNITIVELY WITH THE DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION OFF.|2993
