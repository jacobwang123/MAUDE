THE EVENT OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, BAKER GRADE IV, IS A PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATION AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THIS EVENT. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE EVENT, PRODUCT, OR PATIENT DETAILS WAS REQUESTED; NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE. DEVICE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, ASYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. DEFLATION Â¿ BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS DEFLATE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. DEFLATION CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO DEFLATE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS; FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL; EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED); TRAUMA; COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING; AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF DEFLATION FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT; HOWEVER, IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF DEFLATION. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER THESE ADDITIONAL SURGERIES.

CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENT. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. YOU SHOULD PERFORM SELF-EXAMINATION OF YOUR BREASTS EVERY MONTH FOR CANCER SCREENING. HOWEVER, THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU DISTINGUISH THE IMPLANT FROM YOUR BREAST TISSUE. THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGES IN IMPLANT SHAPE, MAY BE SIGNS OF A RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. THESE SIGNS SHOULD BE REPORTED TO YOUR SURGEON AND POSSIBLY EVALUATED WITH AN MRI. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM.

DEVICE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. RUPTURE: BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. BREAST IMPLANTS RUPTURE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. RUPTURES CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO RUPTURE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, STRESSING THE IMPLANT DURING IMPLANTATION AND WEAKENING IT, FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL, EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED), TRAUMA, COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING, AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF RUPTURE FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT. IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF RUPTURE. LABORATORY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RUPTURE ARE ONGOING. SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE. IF RUPTURE OCCURS, SILICONE GEL MAY EITHER REMAIN WITHIN THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), MOVE OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE (EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), OR MOVE OUTSIDE THE BREAST (GEL MIGRATION). THERE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY THAT RUPTURE MAY PROGRESS FROM INTRACAPSULAR TO EXTRACAPSULAR AND BEYOND. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE: PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION|INSPIRA SMOOTH SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|N-SSM275|01/25/2017||02/17/2017|DA|R|Y||0HP|FTR|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||2690610|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTER REGARDING THE EVENT, PRODUCT, AND/OR PATIENT DETAILS WAS REQUESTED. NO FURTHER FOLLOW UP IS POSSIBLE, AS THE CORRESPONDING AUTHOR IS DECEASED. DEVICE LABELING: POSTOPERATIVE HEMATOMA AND SEROMA MAY BE MINIMIZED BY METICULOUS ATTENTION TO HEMOSTASIS DURING SURGERY, AND POSSIBLY BY POSTOPERATIVE USE OF CLOSED DRAINS. PERSISTENT, EXCESSIVE BLEEDING MUST BE CONTROLLED BEFORE THE TISSUE EXPANDER IS PLACED. IF THE WOUND IS STABLE THE TISSUE EXPANDER MAY BE FILLED TO TISSUE TOLERANCE AT THE TIME OF SURGERY TO HELP MINIMIZE SEROUS FLUID ACCUMULATION IN THE SURROUNDING POCKET. IF WOUND STABILITY IS A CONCERN, INFLATE ONLY SLIGHTLY TO FILL THE POCKET SPACE, WITHOUT APPLYING TENSION TO THE TISSUE. ANY POSTOPERATIVE EVACUATION OF HEMATOMA OR OTHER FLUID ACCUMULATION MUST BE CONDUCTED WITH CARE TO AVOID INTRODUCTION OF CONTAMINANTS OR DAMAGE TO THE TISSUE EXPANDER FROM NEEDLES OR OTHER SHARP INSTRUMENTS. POSTOPERATIVE HEMATOMA AND SEROMA MAY CONTRIBUTE TO INFECTION. POSTOPERATIVE HEMATOMA AND SEROMA MAY BE MINIMIZED BY METICULOUS ATTENTION TO HEMOSTASIS DURING SURGERY, AND POSSIBLY BY POSTOPERATIVE USE OF CLOSED DRAINS.

6498449|72963713|N|1||THIS REPORT IS SUBMITTED IN RESPONSE TO FDA NOTICE TITLED BREAST IMPLANT-ASSOCIATED ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (BIA-ALCL) PROVIDED ON 21/MAR/2017. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CASES REFERENCED IN THE NOTICE IS 359, INCLUDING 9 DEATHS. THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE NOTICE CLASSIFIES THE ALCL EVENTS IN DIFFERENT CATEGORIES, INCLUDING TYPES OF DEVICE, ASSOCIATED ADVERSE EVENTS, PRESENTATION, AND DIAGNOSIS DETAILS, BUT DOES NOT IDENTIFY SPECIFIC DEVICES OR PATIENTS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO INDIVIDUALIZE THIS INFORMATION INTO SPECIFIC REPORTS, AND BY DEFINITION ALREADY INCLUDES EVENTS REPORTED BY ALLERGAN IN THE PAST. THEREFORE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH 21 CFR 803, THIS REPORT WILL REPRESENT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF RECEIPT OF THE NOTICE AND DOCUMENTATION OF ALLERGAN'S ATTEMPT TO INVESTIGATE ADVERSE EVENTS IDENTIFIED IN THAT NOTICE. THIS REPORT WILL NOT SUBSTITUTE FOR ANY INVESTIGATION INTO COMPLAINTS RECEIVED WHERE INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS OR ALLERGAN DEVICES ARE IDENTIFIED, INCLUSIVE OR EXCLUSIVE OF THE 359 CASES MENTIONED IN THE NOTICE. (B)(4). THE EVENTS OF DEATH, LYMPHOMA-ALCL, LYMPHOMA, SEROMA, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, AND BREAST LUMPS ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THESE EVENTS. SALINE DEVICE LABELING: RADIATION TO THE BREAST Â¿ ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE IN VIVO EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, ASYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER THESE ADDITIONAL SURGERIES. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF DEFLATION. ADDITIONAL COMPLICATIONS Â¿ AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. CALCIUM DEPOSITS CAN FORM IN THE TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT WITH SYMPTOMS THAT MAY INCLUDE PAIN AND FIRMNESS. LYMPHADENOPATHY HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED IN SOME WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS. IN THE PASS STUDY, AT LEAST 1 REOPERATION WAS PERFORMED ON 315 PATIENTS (36.5%) THROUGH 10 YEARS. A TOTAL OF 424 REOPERATIONS WERE PERFORMED. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR REOPERATION THROUGH 10 YEARS ON AUGMENTATION PATIENTS WAS IMPLANT DEFLATION AT 21.7%. THE PERCENTAGE OF REOPERATIONS DUE TO LUMP/MASS/CYST INCREASED FROM 8.5% OF 293 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 5 YEARS TO 13.9% OF 424 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 10 YEARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF LUMPS, MASSES, AND CYSTS CAN BE EXPECTED TO NATURALLY INCREASE AS PATIENTS AGE AND COULD BE AN EXPLANATION FOR THE INCREASE. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. FOR MORE COMPLETE AND UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ON FDAÂ¿S ANALYSIS AND REVIEW OF THE ALCL IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST IMPLANTS PLEASE VISIT: HTTP://WWW.FDA.GOV/MEDICALDEVICES/PRODUCTSANDMEDICALPROCEDURES/IMPLANTSANDPROSTHETICS/BREASTIMPLANTS/UCM239995.HTM YOU ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO REPORT ANY PRODUCT PROBLEM OR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT TO ALLERGAN. DEATHS MUST BE REPORTED TO ALLERGAN AND FDA. SILICONE DEVICE LABELING: ONE OF THE KEY COMPLICATIONS REPORTED IS CALLED Â¿CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE.Â¿ CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS A TIGHTENING OF THE SCAR TISSUE (ALSO CALLED A CAPSULE) THAT NORMALLY FORMS AROUND THE BREAST IMPLANT DURING THE HEALING PROCESS AFTER SURGERY. IN SOME WOMEN, THE SCAR TISSUE (CAPSULE) SQUEEZES THE IMPLANT. THIS RESULTS IN FIRMNESS OR HARDENING OF THE BREAST, AND IT IS A RISK FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE. DEGREES OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE ARE CLASSIFIED BY THE BAKER GRADING SCALE.1 CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BAKER GRADES III AND IV ARE THE MOST SEVERE. BAKER GRADE III OFTEN RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SURGERY (REOPERATION) BECAUSE OF PAIN AND POSSIBLY ABNORMAL APPEARANCE. BAKER GRADE IV USUALLY RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR REOPERATION BECAUSE OF PAIN AND UNACCEPTABLE APPEARANCE. DO NOT TREAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BY CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY OR FORCEFUL EXTERNAL COMPRESSION, WHICH WILL LIKELY RESULT IN IMPLANT DAMAGE, RUPTURE, FOLDS, AND/OR HEMATOMA. ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. YOU SHOULD PERFORM SELF-EXAMINATION OF YOUR BREASTS EVERY MONTH FOR CANCER SCREENING. HOWEVER, THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU DISTINGUISH THE IMPLANT FROM YOUR BREAST TISSUE. THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGES IN IMPLANT SHAPE, MAY BE SIGNS OF A RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. THESE SIGNS SHOULD BE REPORTED TO YOUR SURGEON AND POSSIBLY EVALUATED WITH AN MRI. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT.

FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTER REGARDING THE EVENT, PRODUCT, AND/OR PATIENT DETAILS WAS REQUESTED. NO FURTHER FOLLOW UP IS POSSIBLE, AS THE CORRESPONDING AUTHOR IS DECEASED. DEVICE LABELING: THE STRESSES OF THE EXPANDING DEVICE MAY INDUCE PRESSURE ISCHEMIA AND NECROSIS, ESPECIALLY IN TIGHT OR THIN-SKINNED AREAS. FOLDS IN A PARTIALLY FILLED TISSUE EXPANDER MAY ALSO RESULT IN THINNING AND EROSION OF ADJACENT TISSUE. EXCESSIVELY RAPID TISSUE EXPANSION MAY COMPROMISE THE VASCULARITY OF THE OVERLYING TISSUE. AS EXPECTED FOLLOWING ANY INVASIVE SURGICAL PROCEDURE, PAIN OF VARYING INTENSITY AND DURATION MAY OCCUR FOLLOWING TISSUE EXPANDER PLACEMENT. IN ADDITION, THE EXPANSION PROCESS MAY CAUSE SOME DISCOMFORT, BUT SHOULD NOT CAUSE EXCESSIVE PAIN. PAIN MAY INDICATE EXPANSION BEYOND TISSUE TOLERANCE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN ISCHEMIA AND NECROSIS. PAIN MAY ALSO ACCOMPANY OTHER ADVERSE REACTIONS. UNEXPLAINED PAIN MUST BE PROMPTLY INVESTIGATED. FURTHER EXPANSION SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED UNTIL THE PAIN IS RESOLVED. ACTIVE INFECTION ANYWHERE IN THE BODY MAY INCREASE RISK OF PERIPROSTHETIC INFECTION. DO NOT EXPOSE THE TISSUE EXPANDER OR INJECTION NEEDLES TO CONTAMINANTS, WHICH INCREASE THE RISK OF INFECTION. PATIENTS WHO PRESENT WOUND DEHISCENCE, TISSUE EROSION, ISCHEMIA OR NECROSIS RUN AN INCREASED RISK OF PERIPROSTHETIC INFECTION. MEASURES TO PROTECT SUCH AREAS FROM INFECTION SHOULD BE TAKEN. THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY. THE RISKS INCLUDE: IMPLANT DEFLATION/LEAKAGE, ADDITIONAL SURGERY, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, INFECTION, TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME, NECROSIS, HEMATOMA, SEROMA, EXTRUSION, BREAST PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE SENSATION, CHANGES IN BREAST SENSATION, DISSATISFACTION WITH COSMETIC RESULTS (WRINKLING, FOLDING, DISPLACEMENT, ASYMMETRY, PALPABILITY, VISIBILITY, PTOSIS, SLOSHING), CALCIFIC DEPOSITS, IRRITATION/INFLAMMATION, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, HYPERTROPHIC SCARRING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, DIFFICULTY/INABILITY IN BREAST FEEDING, AND INABILITY TO ADEQUATELY VISUALIZE BREAST LESIONS WITH MAMMOGRAPHY.

DEVICE LABELING: BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.

THE EVENTS OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, BAKER GRADE IV, DELAYED HEALING, HEMATOMA, ALLERGIC RASH, CELLULITIS, SEROMA, WOUND DEHISCENCE, AND NECROSIS ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLAINTS, AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THESE EVENTS. FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTER REGARDING THE EVENT, PRODUCT, AND/OR PATIENT DETAILS WAS REQUESTED. DEVICE LABELING: Â¿POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, IMPLANT DEFLATION, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING.Â¿ Â¿DEFLATION Â¿ BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS DEFLATE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. DEFLATION CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO DEFLATE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS; FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL; EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED); TRAUMA; COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING; AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF DEFLATION FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT; HOWEVER, IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF DEFLATION.Â¿ Â¿CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME.

CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION.

6575692|75546313|D|1||MY SITUATION WAS AS SUCH: IN (B)(6) 2015 AFTER BEING DIAGNOSED WITH DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS) FOR A THIRD TIME IN 12 YEARS, I HAD A MASTECTOMY WITH IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION ON MY RIGHT SIDE, WITH A MENTOR GEL-FILLED IMPLANT. WITHIN TWO MONTHS OF MY OPERATION, I HAD AN ODD PERSPIRATION ODOR WHICH REMAINED WITH ME PERMANENTLY. IN THE SPRING OF 2016, I BEGAN FEELING TIRED AFTER MY GYM WORKOUTS, QUITE UNUSUAL AS I HAD ALWAYS EXERCISED REGULARLY, AND I WAS IN PERFECT HEALTH. BY (B)(6) 2016, I BEGAN EXPERIENCING TINGLING AND NUMBNESS IN MY FINGERS, WHICH WAS NOT GOING AWAY. I THEN BEGAN TO HAVE SWOLLEN FINGERS, HANDS AND WRISTS IN (B)(6) OF THE SAME YEAR, WHICH LED TO MY BEING DIAGNOSED WITH CARPEL TUNNEL SYNDROME BY A RHEUMATOLOGIST. THE RHEUMATOLOGIST TOOK BLOOD TESTS AND RESULTS SHOWED I HAD AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE KNOWN AS SCLERODERMA. I WAS SHOCKED AS NOTHING LIKE THIS WAS EVER HEARD OF IN MY FAMILY. I COME FROM A LONG LINE OF HEALTHY PEOPLE WHO MOSTLY LIVE INTO THEIR NINETIES. BY THIS TIME, TOO, I BEGAN FEELING MALAISE, AND I THEN WAS WEAKENED TO THE POINT OF BEING UNABLE TO WALK UNAIDED. FROM THE MIDDLE OF (B)(6)(THE DATE MY PLASTIC SURGEON EXPLANTED THE IMPLANT), I BECAME SO DEBILITATED THAT I COULD NO LONGER WALK. I LOST 20LBS OF MUSCLE DURING THIS ABOVE-NOTED PERIOD, AS MY ARM, LEG AND REAR MUSCLES ATROPHIED, RESULTING IN ME BEING TOTALLY DEBILITATED. I WAS IN EXTREME PAIN, AND I BEGAN LOSING MY HAIR. I COULDNÂ¿T THINK CLEARLY, AND I COULD NOT SLEEP. I SUFFERED FROM EXTREME FATIGUE, AND MY JOINTS WERE SWOLLEN, ESPECIALLY MY RIGHT KNEE. I HAD UPPER BACK AND NECK WEAKNESS. I COULD NOT RAISE MY ARMS, MOVE MY LEGS OR USE MY HANDS. ALL SYMPTOMS STARTED ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF MY BODY, AND WERE MORE SEVERE THAN ON THE LEFT SIDE OF MY BODY. WHEN I TOLD THE RHEUMATOLOGIST ON (B)(6), THAT I HAD AN IMPLANT AND THAT I HAD MADE AN APPOINTMENT TO SEE MY PLASTIC SURGEON THE VERY NEXT DAY SHE SAID, Â¿YOU ARE RIGHT TO MENTION THIS TO ME. AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES ARE OFTEN CAUSED BY EXTERNAL REASONS, AND ARE NOT ALWAYS HEREDITARY.Â¿ IN THIS WAY, SHE CONFIRMED THAT IT COULD BE BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESS THAT I WAS SUFFERING FROM. THE NEXT DAY, MY PLASTIC SURGEON AGREED TO EXPLANT MY MENTOR GEL-FILLED IMPLANT STATING THAT HE COULD NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE IMPLANT WAS CAUSING MY DEBILITATION AND THAT I MIGHT NOT REGAIN MY HEALTH. THE SURGERY WAS ON A THURSDAY MORNING, AND I NEEDED A WHEELCHAIR BY THIS TIME. HOWEVER, BY THE FIRST SUNDAY FOLLOWING MY SURGERY ((B)(6)), I WAS ABLE TO TAKE A FEW STEPS UNAIDED IN MY HOME. TWO WEEKS LATER, I WAS APPROVED BY MY MEDICAL INSURANCE COMPANY TO RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING ASSISTANCE IN MY HOME; PHYSICAL THERAPY, OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY, A PERSONAL AIDE, A NURSE AND A SOCIAL WORKER. I WAS ABLE TO HAVE A VISITING NUN COME ONCE A WEEK ALSO. IT IS NOW (B)(6) 2017 AND I AM ABLE TO WALK AGAIN. I WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE SERVICES FROM THE OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST AND THE SOCIAL WORKER. MY PHYSICAL THERAPIST TOLD ME I MUST MAINTAIN AN EXERCISE PROGRAM THAT HE PRESCRIBED FOR ME. MY PERSONAL AIDE AND THE NURSE HAVE STOPPED COMING NOW AS I AM FINALLY SHOWING SIGNS OF RECOVERY. I CONTINUE TO HAVE SWELLING IN MY HANDS AND WEAKNESS IN MY UPPER ARMS, NECK AND BACK. IT IS QUITE DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT THE MENTOR GEL-FILLED IMPLANT WAS LEECHING OR BLEEDING TOXINS INTO MY BODY TO THE EXTENT THAT I WAS TOTALLY DEBILITATED FOR OVER 10 MONTHS OF MY LIFE. I THANK THE RHEUMATOLOGIST FOR VALIDATING THE FACT THAT THE IMPLANT COULD BE THE CAUSE. I HAVE BEEN ON A DETOX DIET SINCE (B)(6) 2016. I WAS UNABLE TO LEAVE MY HOUSE UNAIDED FROM (B)(6) DUE TO THIS ILLNESS. I ONLY LEFT THE HOUSE FOR DOCTOR APPOINTMENTS. I COULD NOT TAKE MYSELF TO THESE APPOINTMENTS. AT PRESENT, I CANNOT SIT FOR LONG, TIRE EASILY AND CANNOT DRIVE FAR. MY UPPER BODY MUSCLES ACHE, AND I CONTINUE TO HAVE DIFFICULTY SLEEPING.

FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTER REGARDING THE EVENT, PRODUCT, AND/OR PATIENT DETAILS WAS REQUESTED. NO FURTHER FOLLOW UP IS POSSIBLE, AS THE CORRESPONDING AUTHOR IS DECEASED. DEVICE LABELING: ACTIVE INFECTION ANYWHERE IN THE BODY MAY INCREASE RISK OF PERIPROSTHETIC INFECTION. DO NOT EXPOSE THE TISSUE EXPANDER OR INJECTION NEEDLES TO CONTAMINANTS, WHICH INCREASE THE RISK OF INFECTION. PATIENTS WHO PRESENT WOUND DEHISCENCE, TISSUE EROSION, ISCHEMIA OR NECROSIS RUN AN INCREASED RISK OF PERIPROSTHETIC INFECTION. MEASURES TO PROTECT SUCH AREAS FROM INFECTION SHOULD BE TAKEN. SIGNS OF ACUTE INFECTION REPORTED IN ASSOCIATION WITH TISSUE EXPANDERS INCLUDE, TENDERNESS, FLUID ACCUMULATION, PAIN AND FEVER. INFECTION MAY COMPROMISE THE EXPANSION PROCESS. POSTOPERATIVE INFECTIONS SHOULD BE TREATED AGGRESSIVELY ACCORDING TO STANDARD MEDICAL PRACTICES TO AVOID MORE SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS. INFECTION THAT IS UNRESPONSIVE TO TREATMENT OR NECROTIZING INFECTION MAY REQUIRE PREMATURE TISSUE EXPANDER REMOVAL. INFECTION IS AN INHERENT RISK FOLLOWING ANY TYPE OF INVASIVE SURGERY, AND MAY OCCUR DURING THE TISSUE EXPANSION PROCESS. PATIENTS WHO PRESENT WITH WOUND DEHISCENCE, TISSUE EROSION, ISCHEMIA OR NECROSIS, AND PATIENTS UNDERGOING IMMEDIATE BREAST RECONSTRUCTION RUN AN INCREASED RISK OF PERIPROSTHETIC INFECTION. SIGNS OF ACUTE INFECTION REPORTED IN ASSOCIATION WITH TISSUE EXPANDERS INCLUDE ERYTHEMA, TENDERNESS, FLUID ACCUMULATION, PAIN AND FEVER. ERYTHEMA MAY ALSO OCCUR AS A NORMAL RESPONSE TO EXPANSION. ASPIRATION TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THIS TYPE OF ERYTHEMA AND ERYTHEMA AS A SIGN OF EARLY INFECTION IS A RECOGNIZED PRECAUTION. RESEARCH IDENTIFIES STAPHYLOCOCCUS AND PSEUDOMONAS ORGANISMS IN ASSOCIATION WITH INFECTION AROUND TISSUE EXPANDERS. ESCHERICHIA AND STREPTOCOCCUS ORGANISMS HAVE ALSO BEEN NOTED IN ASSOCIATION WITH TISSUE EXPANDERS IN THE LOWER EXTREMITIES. INFECTION MAY OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER SURGERY, AND MAY COMPROMISE THE EXPANSION PROCESS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE RELATED TO INFECTION IN THE AREA SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT. POSTOPERATIVE INFECTIONS SHOULD BE TREATED AGGRESSIVELY ACCORDING TO STANDARD MEDICAL PRACTICES TO AVOID MORE SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS. INFECTION THAT IS UNRESPONSIVE TO TREATMENT OR NECROTIZING INFECTION MAY REQUIRE PREMATURE BREAST TISSUE EXPANDER REMOVAL. IN RARE INSTANCES, ACUTE INFECTION MAY OCCUR IN A BREAST WITH IMPLANTS. THE SIGNS OF ACUTE INFECTION INCLUDE ERYTHEMA, TENDERNESS, FLUID ACCUMULATION,PAIN, AND FEVER. VERY RARELY, TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME, A POTENTIALLY LIFE-THREATENING CONDITION, HAS BEEN REPORTED IN WOMEN AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY. IT IS CHARACTERIZED BY SYMPTOMS THAT OCCUR SUDDENLY AND INCLUDE HIGH FEVER (102Â°F, 38.8Â°C OR HIGHER), VOMITING, DIARRHEA, A SUNBURN-LIKE RASH, RED EYES, DIZZINESS, LIGHTHEADEDNESS, MUSCLE ACHES, AND DROPS IN BLOOD PRESSURE, WHICH MAY CAUSE FAINTING. PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED TO CONTACT A PHYSICIAN IMMEDIATELY FOR DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT FOR ANY OF THESE SYMPTOMS. POSTOPERATIVE HEMATOMA AND SEROMA MAY CONTRIBUTE TO INFECTION. POSTOPERATIVE HEMATOMA AND SEROMA MAY BE MINIMIZED BY METICULOUS ATTENTION TO HEMOSTASIS DURING SURGERY, AND POSSIBLY BY POSTOPERATIVE USE OF CLOSED DRAINS.

A REVIEW OF DEVICE HISTORY RECORD HAS BEEN INITIATED. IF ANY NEW, CHANGED OR CORRECTION INFORMATION IS NOTED, A SUPPLEMENTAL MEDWATCH WILL BE SUBMITTED. ADVERSE EVENTS: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, ASYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER THESE ADDITIONAL SURGERIES. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF DEFLATION. INFECTION Â¿ IN RARE INSTANCES, ACUTE INFECTION MAY OCCUR IN A BREAST WITH IMPLANTS. THE SIGNS OF ACUTE INFECTION INCLUDE ERYTHEMA, TENDERNESS, FLUID ACCUMULATION, PAIN, AND FEVER. VERY RARELY, TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME, A POTENTIALLY LIFE-THREATENING CONDITION, HAS BEEN REPORTED IN WOMEN AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY. IT IS CHARACTERIZED BY SYMPTOMS THAT OCCUR SUDDENLY AND INCLUDE HIGH FEVER (102Â°F, 38.8Â°C OR HIGHER), VOMITING, DIARRHEA, A SUNBURN-LIKE RASH, RED EYES, DIZZINESS, LIGHTHEADEDNESS, MUSCLE ACHES, AND DROPS IN BLOOD PRESSURE, WHICH MAY CAUSE FAINTING. PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED TO CONTACT A PHYSICIAN IMMEDIATELY FOR DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT FOR ANY OF THESE SYMPTOMS. ADDITIONAL COMPLICATIONS Â¿ AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. CALCIUM DEPOSITS CAN FORM IN THE TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT WITH SYMPTOMS THAT MAY INCLUDE PAIN AND FIRMNESS. LYMPHADENOPATHY HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED IN SOME WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS.|STYLE 68 SALINE FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|68-600|07/26/2017||||N|R||0HP|FWM|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||2970624|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||68-600||True

THE RPTR HAD A NEEDLE-DIRECTED CT BIOPSY WHICH SHOWED SILICONE AND GIANT CELLS. THE RPTR WAS INJECTED WITH FLUROINATED GLUCOSE AFTER WHICH A PET SCAN WAS DONE WHICH SHOWED THE TWO LYMPH NODES. THE RPTR IS TO HAVE SURGERY ON 8/15/94, TO DETERMINE IF IT IS ONLY SILICONE IN THE LYMPH NODES OR IF SHE HAS HAD A RECURRENCE OF CANCER.

SHE WAS HUGGING HER HUSBAND IN SPRING 1985 WHEN SHE FELT A POP AT HER LEFT BREAST. SHE ASSUMED IT WAS THE SCAR TISSUE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT THAT RELEASD BECAUSE SHE WAS TOLD THEY WOULD NOT RUPTURE FROM EVERYDAY SITUATIONS. THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN THE BREAST AND SHE SOON FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT. IT CAME TO HER ATTENTION YEARS LATER THAT IMPLANTS WERE RUPTURING AND SHE STARTED TO SUSPECT IT AS A CAUSE FOR HER FAILING HEALTH.

SHE ALSO STARTED TO GET STABBING PAINS IN THE AREA OF THE OUTER CORNER OF HER LEFT EYE. OVER TIME IT DEVELOPED INTO A ""HEADACHE THAT WAS CONSTANT, DAY AND NIGHT FOR EIGHT YEARS.

THE TOTAL NUMBNESS OF HER ARMS AND HANDS HAS SUBSIDED BUT NOW SHE HAS MORE PINS AND NEEDLES, PAIN AND BURNING PAIN. THEY WILL GO COMPLETELY NUMB ON OCCASION, MOSTLY DURING SLEEP.

BASED ON WHAT INFO WAS AVAILABLE TO HER, THE MEDICAL CONSENSUS AT THE TIME SEEMED TO BE THAT WOMEN WITH THIS PROBLEM HAD A HIGHER RATE OF BREAST CANCER COUPLED WITH A LOWER CURE RATE DUE TO THIS DIFFICULTY OF EARLY DETECTION. RPTR HAD BILATERAL SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY AND RECONSTRUCTION OF THE BREAST WITH  GEL IMPLANTS WITHOUT PATCHES ON 6/12/81 AT AGE 40. WITHIN 3 WKS RPTR COULD DETECT HARDNESS IN BOTH BREASTS. IN LESS THAN SIX MONTHS THESE WERE VERY PAINFUL AND THERE WAS MARKED CAPSULE FORMATION ON BOTH SIDES WITH SOME WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT. THROUGHOUT THIS SIX MONTH PERIOD SHE WAS TOLD TO VIGOROUSLY MASSAGE AND PULL THE IMPLANTS TO THE MIDLINE WHICH SHE DID IN SPITE OF THIS CAUSING FURTHER PAIN AS THE HARDNESS AND DEFORMITY INCREASED. ALSO AT THIS POINT THE LEFT IMPLANT HAD SHIFTED DOWN AND LATERALLY. RPTR WAS TOLD BY DR THAT HE MAY HAVE TO RELEASE THE SCAR SURGICALLY. IT WAS THEN RPTR DECIDED TO GET A SECOND OPINION. IT WAS ONLY THEN RPTR DISCOVERED THAT THE IMPLANTS WERE PLACED SUBMAMMARY NOT SUBPECTORAL AND WOULD HAVE TO BE REMOVED AND NEW IMPLANTS PLACED SUBPECTORALLY.

IN THE ALMOST 13 YRS SINCE HER FIRST BREAST SURGERY AT AGE 40 THERE HAS NOT BEEN ONE DAY THAT SHE HAS BEEN COMPLETELY PAIN-FREE. THE EMOTIONAL SCARRING IS EQUALLY EVIDENT. IN ADDITION TO THE PAIN AND TRAUMA OF FIVE (SOON TO BE SIX) SURGERIES AND THE EVERYDAY PAIN AND DISCOMFORT IN THE BREAST AREA, RPTR HAS SLOWLY DEVELOPED OTHER PROBLEMS THAT SHE FEELS ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THESE IMPLANTS. THESE INCLUDE SEVERE MUSCLE PAIN, NUMBNESS AND TINGLING IN THE EXTREMITIES AND EVER INCREASING JOINT PAIN AND STIFFNESS.

33013|26908|D|1||ON 10/30/80 RPTR HAD A BILATERAL SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY BECAUSE OF SCLEROSING ADENOSIS (A PREMALIGNANT LESION). ON 11/21/80 RPTR HAD BREAST RECONSTRUCTION WITH DOUBLE LUMEN SILICONE IMPLANTS. RPTR HAD ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS - SWELLING, DRAINING, MANY INFECTIONS WITH MANY ANTIBIOTICS. DRAINING NOTED IN THE SURGEON'S RECORDS WERE 50CC ON 12/1/80; 100CC ON 12/3/80 OF THIN, BROWNISH-RED FLUID WAS EASILY DRAINED FROM THE WOUND. TOWARDS THE END OF THE DRAINAGE IT APPEARED TO BE PERFECTLY CLEAR. THEREFORE, RPTR IS CONCERNED THAT THE PROSTHESIS MAY HAVE LEAKED OR HAVE BEEN PUNCTURED BY DR ENTERING THE WOUND WITH A HEMOSTAT (THIS IS FROM DR'S RECORD DATED 12/3/80). 12/17/81 MINIMAL AMOUNT, 1/8/81 MINIMAL DRAINAGE, 1/9/81 LESS THAN 3CC, 1/12/81 MINIMAL DRAINAGE, ETC. 1/5/81 RIGHT PROSTHESIS EXPOSED. REMOVED THROUGH WOUND IN DR'S OFFICE. 1/15/81 INFLATABLE PROSTHESIS PUT IN TO KEEP THE SPACE IN THE RIGHT BREAST SO THE FIRST PROSTHESIS CAN BE PUT BACK IN, THE ERODED HOLE TO BE CLOSED. 2/10/81 REPLACEMENT OF RIGHT BREAST PROSTHESIS. 2/24/81 INFECTION, DRAINAGE, PROSTHESIS REMOVED AGAIN. 2/27/81 ON LEFT BREAST, THAT HAD BEEN DOING VERY WELL EXCEPT FOR CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, THE SKIN WORE AWAY AND ERODED SO LEFT PROSTHESIS REMOVED. 4/30/81 RPTR WANTED NO MORE INTERNAL IMPLANTS SO A 2ND BILATERAL MASTECTOMY WAS DONE. WHEN RPTR'S DISEASE IS ACTIVE SHE SLEEPS ABOUT 14 HRS A DAY. SHE HAD HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE (MEDICATION WAS HCTZ AND CORGARD. DR SAID IT WAS UNUSUAL TO TAKE A PERSON OFF OF HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE MEDS). SHE IS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH HER EYES BECAUSE HER VISION CONSTANTLY CHANGES AND SHE HAS 3 PAIRS OF GLASSES. HER OPHTHAMOLOGIST SAID TO WEAR THE GLASSES SHE CAN SEE WITH EACH DAY. SHE ALSO HAS SWELLING OF HANDS AND FEET, STIFFNESS IN HANDS IN MORNING, SPASTIC COLON, RAYNAUD'S DISEASE IN FEET, STRANGE PAIN IN SCALP, AND SKIN RASHES. WITH A FLARE-UP OF LUPUS SHE CAN HARDLY FUNCTION. SHE HOLDS ON TO THE WALLS, CANNOT GO OUT ALONE, CANNOT DRIVE OR GO TO DR ALONE, CANNOT FOLLOW A STORY ON TV, HER SPEECH IS SLURRED, HER MIND ONLY GOES 1/3 THE USUAL SPEED AND SHE SLEEPS MOST OF THE TIME. SHE FEELS AS IF SHE HAS A TERRIBLE FLU. SHE REQUESTED TO HAVE HER IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED TO WEAR A BRA AS EXTERNAL PROSTHESES. THE BROWN PAPER BAGS THAT THE IMPLANTS WERE IN BECAME OILY. SOMETHING GREY IN COLOR WAS GROWING INSIDE THE IMPLANT AND THERE WAS SOMETHING INSIDE THE IMPLANT THAT LOOKED AND FELT LIKE BIRD SEED. SHE GAVE THE IMPLANTS TO THE DR WHO GAVE THEM TO THE MFR.

ACCORDING TO A MEDICAL AND NEUROLOGIC EVALUATION 1/30/95: PT REPORTS BEING IN HER USUAL EXCELLENT STATE OF MEDICAL, NEUROLOGIC, AND PSYCHIATRIC HEALTH WHEN SHE CONSULTED THE DR FOR COSMETIC AUGMENTATION MAMMOPLASTY WITH INSERTION OF BILATERAL SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS. SHE DEVELOPED SOME IMMEDIATE DECREASED SENSATION IN THE NIPPLES, WHICH WITH TIME CHANGED TO A MILD HYPERSENSITIVITY. OTHERWISE, THERE WERE NO IMMEDIATE COMPLICATIONS FROM THIS SURGERY. HOWEVER, ONE WEEK LATER, PT WAS INVOLVED IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT. SHE IMMEDIATELY DEVELOPED BURNING PAIN IN HER BREASTS, AND IMPLANTS WERE KNOCKED INTO NEW POSITIONS, WITH ONE OBVIOUSLY AT A DIFFERENT LEVEL THAN THE OTHER.

HOWEVER, INSTEAD, BOTH IMPLANTS HARDENED MARKEDLY, ESPECIALLY ON THE RIGHT, AND DID NOT IMPROVE IN PLACEMENT. DUE TO THE UNACCEPTABLE HARDENING AND PLACEMENT, PT WAS REOPERATED IN 1975, WITH FINDINGS OF BILATERAL IMPLANT RUPTURE. NEW IMPLANTS WERE PLACED AT THAT TIME. SHORTLY THEREAFTER, BOTH IMPLANTS HARDENED, ESPECIALLY ON THE RIGHT, AND SEVERAL CLOSED CAPSULOTOMIES WERE PERFORMED, WHICH EVENTUALLY SOFTENED THE LEFT IMPLANT, BUT COULD NOT EFFECTIVELY SOFTEN THE RIGHT ONE. IN 1978, THE RIGHT IMPLANT AND EXTENSIVE SCAR TISSUE WERE REMOVED AND A NEW IMPLANT PLACED ON THE RIGHT.

226781|18473741|D|1||"RPTR WRITES, ""AFTER HAVING MY DAUGHTER IN 6/70 I HAD PROBLEMS WITH BOTH MY BREASTS. AFTER HAVING MY SECOND DAUGHTER IN 7/71, PROBLEMS I HAD WITH BOTH MY BREASTS WERE GETTING WORSE. HAVING BEEN SEEN BY MY GENERAL PRACTITIONER, I WAS SENT FOR SCAN ON BOTH BREASTS. FIBROCYSTIC MASTITIS WAS DIAGNOSED, AND I ALSO HAD GREEN FLUID OOZING FROM BOTH NIPPLES ACCOMPANIED WITH SEVERE PAIN. THE TREATMENT I WAS ON WAS DANAZOL, BUT TO NO AVAIL. I SAW MY GENERAL PRACTITIONER AGAIN WHO THEN MADE ME AN APPOINTMENT TO SEE BREAST SURGEON. I HAD NO FURTHER SCANS THAT REVEALED I HAD FIBROCYSTIC MASTITIS; BY THAT TIME FLUID FROM BOTH MY NIPPLES HAD BECOME EMERALD GREEN COLOR, REALLY DARK GREEN, ALSO WITH PAIN BECOMING WORSE. I WAS TOLD TO WRAP HOT WATER BOTTLE IN TOWEL AND PLACE TO MY BREAST; AND I WAS GIVEN PAIN CONTROL DRUGS. I STOOD PAIN UNTIL I COULD NO MORE. IN 6/90, I SAW BREAST SURGEON AGAIN, ASKING HIM IF THERE WAS WAY HE COULD RELIEVE ME FROM TERRIBLE PAIN I WAS IN. I WAS TOLD THAT THERE COULD ONLY BE ONE SOLUTION, AND THAT WAS TO HAVE DOUBLE MASTECTOMY. HE WOULD ONLY DO IT IF I WAS TO HAVE SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. I AGREED. I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE. IN 8/89 I HAD BILATERAL ""MAMMADOCHECTOMY."" THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT EITHER, SO THAT'S WHY I ASKED FOR MASTECTOMY. I SAW BREAST SURGEON WHO REFERRED ME TO PLASTIC SURGEON, AND OPERATION WAS A JOINT ONE. THE BREAST WAS REMOVED, AND BREAST TISSUE DOWN TO MUSCLE (SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY); AND IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION WITH SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. THIS WAS CARRIED OUT IN 1990. I HAD BILATERAL SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY DEEP DOWN TO PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE, IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS IN 1990. THE IMPLANTS BECAME EXPOSED DUE TO SCARS GAPING OPEN, FLUID WAS OOZING OUT. SWABS TAKEN OF FLUID REVEALED AFTER CULTURED PLASMA (KLEBSIELLA AEROGENES). I WAS GIVEN IV 500 MG METRONIDAZOLE, TETRACYCLINE/FLUCLOXACILLIN/PAIN KILLERS TYLOX. I HAD BLOOD TRANSFUSION AND IMPLANTS REMOVED FOLLOWING DAY. I WAS TOLD WHAT HAPPENED WAS JUST A ONE IN A MILLION CHANCE OF EVER HAPPENING, AND THAT I COULD HAVE SECOND ATTEMPT OF BEING REINSERTED WITH THE BREAST IMPLANTS AFTER 8 MOS. I TOOK SURGEON'S OFFER, AND HAD SECOND ATTEMPT OF HAVING SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLANTS. AGAIN IN 1991 I HAD INSERTION OF BREAST IMPLANTS YET AGAIN. IN 1992 I ALSO HAD TO HAVE THEM REMOVED DUE TO SYSTEMIC INFECTION. IN 1997, I CAME ACROSS THE PACKAGE INSERT AND PRODUCT DATA SHEET, CLEARLY STATING THAT MASTITIS OR ANY ACTIVE INFECTION IS CONTRAINDICATED TO USE OF BREAST IMPLANTS MADE FROM SILICONE GEL. I AM SO ILL WITH FIBRO-FATTY CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDER, ACCOMPANIED WITH SEVERE PAIN, PROMINENTLY MARKED VASCULARITY, FIBROMYALGIA, CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME, HYPOTHYROIDISM, PLANTAR FASCIITIS, ARTHRITIS IN KNEES, HANDS AND BACK. I EXPERIENCE NOW SEVERE PAIN IN HANDS, FINGERS, ARMS, THIGHS, BUTTOCKS CHEEKS, HIPS, AND CALVES OF BOTH LEGS. I HAVE LOSS OF BALANCE, LOSS OF WORDS, CONCENTRATION PROBLEMS, DRY EYES, MOUTH, NOSE AND VAGINA. I ALSO HAVE A LOT OF INFECTIONS, BREATHING DIFFICULTY, BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS, THRUSH IN MOUTH/VAGINA, CHEST INFECTIONS, THROAT INFECTIONS, EAR INFECTIONS, BOWEL DISORDER, AND BLADDER PROBLEMS. I HAVE WIDESPREAD PAPILLOMAS, CHEST THROUGH ARMS AND NECK. I HAVE FIBROS TISSUE IN MY JOINTS. I ALSO HAVE PAIN IN MY HEAD; IT IS NOT A HEADACHE, IT IS LIKE WHEN INFECTION AND PUSS THROB LIKE PAIN. LOSS OF SLEEP, DROPPING THINGS, BUMPING INTO THINGS, ELECTRIC SHOCK - LIKE WHEN YOU TOUCH BARE WIRES ON ELECTRICAL GOODS, IF I TOUCH ANYTHING METAL. CRAWLING SENSATION IF I TOUCH NYLON, DRYLON, LEATHER OR POLYESTER; IF I USE TALC PERFUMED AND COLORED SOAP. I ALSO HAVE FOOD ALLERGIES. DUE TO HAVING BACTERIAL INFECTIONS I STILL EVEN TODAY TAKE METRONIDAZOLE, ANTIBIOTICS, AND ANTIFUNGAL MEDICATION TOO. I FEEL VERY WEAK, I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING CHRONIC FLU-LIKE SYMPTOMS, BUT I DON'T HAVE THE FLU. I CAN ONLY STAND, EVEN WALK SHORT PACES BEFORE BECOMING EXHAUSTED, AND MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE SEVERE PAIN I SUFFER FROM. I'M IN MY EARLY 40'S, BUT AT THIS MOMENT I FEEL LIKE 90, AND IT ISN'T RIGHT. DOCTORS I'M UNDER DON'T KNOW HOW TO BEGIN TO TREAT ME. HOWEVER, THEY KNOW WHAT CAUSE IS BUT AT THIS MOMENT CANNOT OFFER ANY KIND OF TREATMENT. I AM A TEST CASE OVER HERE OF THE DOCTORS WHO ARE DEALING WITH ME. LET'S HOPE SOMETHING CAN BE DONE PRETTY SOON. I DO BLAME SURGEONS FOR THEIR IGNORANCE AND STUPIDITY OF WAY THEY HAVE TREATED ME IN THE FIRST PLACE. TO BEGIN WITH, FOR IGNORING THE PRODUCT DATA SHEETS OF ALL BREAST IMPLANTS, ALONG WITH IGNORING THE PACKAGE INSERTS TOO. I HAVE LOST ALL TRUST AND FAITH IN MEDICAL PROFESSION. THE GOVERNMENT: FOR REFUSING TO CARRY OUT ANY KIND OF RESEARCH OR TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE LIKE ME WITH SAME ILLNESS; TREATMENT WE NEED SO DESPERATELY TO GET WELL. I KNOW I'M AS TOUGH AS NAILS. I DON'T INTEND TO SIT BACK AND DO NOTHING. I'M DETERMINED TO GET SOMEWHERE AND GET TREATMENT I SO DESPERATELY NEED. UP UNTIL 1989 I USED TO WORK FULL TIME, 16 HRS A DAY IN A CUTLERY FACTORY. I ALSO TOOK CARE OF MY MOM WHO DIED FROM TERMINAL CANCER BACK IN 1985. I ALSO TOOK CARE OF MY FATHER WHO ALSO DIED FROM A TERMINAL DISEASE. BOTH OF MY PARENTS DIED FROM CHEST ILLNESSES, MOST OF MY FATHER'S FAMILY DIED FROM TUBERCULOSIS, LUNG CANCER, HEART ATTACKS, AND STROKES. IN MY MOM'S FAMILY THEY DIED OF LUNG/BREAST CANCER ETHACENIA. THEY ALL WENT TO OPEN AIR SCHOOL. I WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS BORN IN PERFECT HEALTH, THAT IS UNTIL I MARRIED AND HAD CHILDREN AT THE AGE OF 16."" HISTORY: PT SUFFERED FROM CHRONIC BREAST PAIN FOR A PERIOD OF APPROX 20 YRS AND WHICH WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CYSTIC MASTITIS. VARIOUS CONSERVATIVE, DRUG TREATMENT REGIMES WERE TRIED TO HELP HER WITH THIS PROBLEM BUT TO NO AVAIL. SHE DESCRIBES HAVING A COLORED DISCHARGE COMING FROM HER NIPPLES IN ADDITION TO THE PAIN. SHE CAME UNDER THE CARE OF A CONSULTANT GENERAL SURGEON WHO PERFORMED AN OPERATION ON HER BREAST DUCTS IN 1989.

HE SAID THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE THE FORMATION OF THE SCAR TISSUE WITH THE CAPSULAR CONTRACTIONS. THIS IS HOW I WAS GIVEN A POLYURETHANE COATED IMPLANT IN MY LEFT BREAST (CANCER SIDE - MASTECTOMY). HISTORY: IN 1988 WENT TO SEE THIS PLASTIC SURGEON WHO WAS REFERRED TO ME TO SEE IF HE COULD POSSIBLY STITCH BOTH MY BREASTS UP FOR THEY HAD BECOME EMPTY SACS AFTER I STOPPED MENSTRUATING AND HIS SOLUTION WAS TO AUGMENT THEM AND AFTER CONSIDERATION HE DID AND PUT IN TWO SILICONE IMPLANTS. IN TIME THESE STARTED TO GIVE ME PAIN AND HAD CAPSULAR CONTRACTIONS AND THEY STARTED RIDING HIGH AND THEY WERE SO SEVERE THAT HE SUGGESTED THAT WITH HIS PTS WITH THIS PROBLEM HE OPTED FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE SILICONE AND REPLACE THEM WITH 2 POLYURETHANE IMPLANTS WHICH WOULD ADHERE BETTER AND YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SUCH CONTRACTIONS. I DID THIS AND HAD THIS PROCEDURE PERFORMED AT HIS SURGICAL SUITE ON 7/2/90. SEE NOTES AT END OF HISTORY OF IMPLANTS. HAD REGULAR MAMMOGRAMS AND IN THE LATTER PART OF 1991 I WAS FEELING A LUMP IN MY LEFT BREAST EVEN THOUGH THE LATEST MAMMOGRAM DID NOT SHOW ANYTHING. I REQUESTED ANOTHER MAMMOGRAM AT A DIFFERENT LOCATION AND THIS SHOWED NOTHING. ASKED MY DR IF I COULD HAVE A WRITTEN PRESCRIPTION TO HAVE A SONOGRAM PERFORMED AND I DID AND SURE ENOUGH I DID HAVE A LUMP. WENT TO SEE MY PLASTIC SURGEON AND HE REFERRED ME TO THE ONE OF THE FINEST BREAST SURGEONS. WENT TO SEE HIM FIRST OF JANUARY AND HE SCHEDULED ME FOR A BIOPSY ON 1/13/92 AND WHEN WE GOT THE REPORT BACK IT WAS CANCEROUS AND SO I WENT TO SEE HIM THE NEXT DAY AND WE DISCUSSED THE DIFFERENT PROCEDURES, ETC. AND HE BOOKED ME FOR SURGERY ON 1/21/1992. I OPTED FOR A MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY BECAUSE I DID HAVE THE SILICONE IMPLANT IN THE BREAST AND WAS DEVASTED WITH THE FACT THAT I HAD CANCER. I HAD THIS PROCEDURE AND HAD THE SAME PLASTIC SURGEON DO THE RECONSTRUCTION WITH A SALINE EXPANDER. THE VERY NEXT MORNING THE PLASTIC SURGEON TOLD ME AT THE HOSP THAT HE WAS SURE THE SALINE HAD RUPTURED AND TO CALL HIM THE FOLLOWING WEEK TO SET UP AN APPOINTMENT TO REPLACE THE SALINE, WHICH I DID. FOLLOWING THIS SALINE IMPLANT I HAD SEVERE REJECTION AND CONTRACTURES WHICH ONCE AGAIN THE IMPLANT STARTED TO MOVE UPWARDS. WENT BACK TO PLASTIC SURGEON WE DISCUSSED THE PAST IMPLANT HISTORY AND THAT THE POLYURETHANE COATED IMPLANTS SEEM TO BE THE ONLY ONES WHICH WORKED. THAT THIS WOULD BE THE ONLY OPTION BUT THAT I HAD TO SIGN A WAIVER. HE NEVER AT ANY TIME INFORMED ME OF THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OR HEALTH RISK INVOLVED WITH THESE TYPES OF IMPLANTS, BUT I HAD NO INFO FROM THE MFR OR INFO REGARDING THESE IMPLANTS NOR DID I KNOW THAT THE FDA STOPPED THE MFRS FROM MAKING THE POLYURETHANE IMPLANTS UNTIL I REQUEST THE BREAST IMPLANT, 1998 FROM THE FDA. I HAD STARTED TO HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS: SKIN RASHES, ALLERGIES, REDNESS, JOINT SWELLING AND SUSPECTED THAT THIS WAS FROM A SEVERE ALLERGY FROM POLYURETHANE COATING, ITCHNESS WITHIN BREAST ESPECIALLY MY LEFT BREAST (MASTY. BREAST). THIS WENT ON FOR OVER SIX YEARS. WENT FROM DR TO DR TO SPECIALIST BACK TO MY OWN DRS, ONCOLOGIST, INTERNIST, GYN, PLASTIC SURGEON AND GOT NO REAL INFO. ALSO HAD SEVERE PAINS IN BOTH BREASTS, CONTRACTIONS. FINALLY IN JUNE OF 1998 AFTER SEEING 11 DERMATOLOGISTS, 2 ALLERGISTS, ETC., I WENT TO SEE MY ONCOLOGIST AND ASKED FOR AN MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING BREAST TEST AND I HAD ONE DONE ON 7/2/98. RESULTS OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING STATE THAT REACTIVE FLUID CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, AND CONTAINED OTHER INFO. I HAD THESE FAXED TO ALL MY DRS, NO ONE GAVE ME ANY INFO REGARDING THIS MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING TEST. WENT AND SAW DRS ONCE AGAIN! GOT NOWHERE; TOLD THEM I THOUGHT IMPLANTS WERE CAUSE OF MY BEING ILL. RASHES, ALLERGIES ARE WORSE THAN MY RIGHT BREAST ENLARGED TO ABOUT TWO SIZES LARGER, RED RASHES, ITCHY, VEINS POPPING, EXTREME PAIN, FEVER IN LEFT BREAST, AND OTHER SYMPTOMS WERE MISSING IN RIGHT BREAST WHEN I DISCOVERED A LUMP UNDER MY RIGHT ARMPIT. CALLED MY BREAST SURGEON GOT AN APPOINTMENT 10/9/98, AND HE GAVE ME ANTIOBIOTICS BUT GAVE ME AN APPOINTMENT AT HIS MEDICAL SUITE TO HAVE A BIOPSY ON 10/14/98. HE REMOVED MY LYMPH NODE AND AFTER PATHOLOGIST REPORT CAME IN AS BENIGN. OTHER REPORTS WERE NOT IN AND I CALLED TO HAVE THEM FAX THE RESULTS AND IT SHOWED I HAD FOREIGN MATERIAL CONSISTENT WITH SILICONE AND THERE WAS A TAN FLESHY SUBSTANCE IN THE RIGHT AUXILLARY LYMPH NODE AND ALSO GIANT REACTIVE FLUID PRESENT, ETC. I FAXED THIS INFO TO MY ONCOLOGIST, PLASTIC SURGEON, WENT TO SEE THEM BUT NOTHING AS FAR AS WHAT I KNEW WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS AND THEIR CONCLUSIONS. FOUND OUT WHO WAS THE MEDICAL ADVISOR AND DIRECTOR FOR CANCER AT THE HOSP WHERE I RESIDE AND WENT TO SEE A DR ON 12/3/98 WITH MY HISTORY. HE JUST CONSULTS AND HE AFTER GOING THROUGH ALL THE PAPERS AND DOCUMENTS I BROUGHT IN CONCURRED WITH ME THAT I NEEDED TO HAVE MY IMPLANTS REMOVED AND RECOMMENDED AND SENT MY INFO TO A DR. APPOINTMENT SET FOR 3/1/99. ALSO GOT IN TOUCH WITH WOMEN IN THE IMPLANT TASK FORCE IN THE BACK OF THE BREAST IMPLANT UPDATED 1998 BOOK AND THEY RECOMMENDED A DR."|UNIMED POLYURETHANE - COATED PROSTHESES|UNK|02/23/1999|A||*|Y||205138.0|0HP|FTR|3.0||POLYURETHANE - COATED SILICONE IMPLANTS|Y|UNK|2317 EATON LN||RACINE|US|MEDICAL ENGINEERING CORP A BRISTOL MYERS SQUIBB CO.||WI|53404||UNK|LEFT|True

OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: BILATERALLY SILICONE IMPLANT AND IMPLANT MATERIAL REMOVAL; BILATERAL FORMAL CAPSULECTOMIES (EXTENSIVE AND SEPARATE PROCEDURE); BILATERAL RETROMAMMARY BREAST RECONSTRUCTION WITH MCGHAN TEXTURED HIGH PROFILE ROUND GEL STYLE. PROCEDURE: THE PT WAS MARKED IN AN AWAKE SITTING POSITION. ALL THE RISKS, ALTERNATIVES AND IMPONDERABLES WERE DISCUSSED WITH THE PT PRIOR TO PROCEEDING AND PT'S SPOUSE. ABSOLUTELY NO GUARANTEES WHATSOEVER WERE MADE. THIS PT HAD A RUPTURED IMPLANT ON THE LEFT SIDE AND A VERY WORRISOME PRESENTATION ON THE RIGHT WITH A LOT OF BREAST ASYMMETRY AND QUESTIONED RUPTURE ON THE RIGHT SIDE. BOTH WERE ENTERED THROUGH INFRAMAMMARY INCISIONS. BOTH WERE FREELY RUPTURED. THE RIGHT SIDE HAD EXTENSIVE SAPONIFICATION AND CALCIFICATION AND BOTH SIDES HAD EXTENSIVE GRANULOMAS. AFTER THE IMPLANT AND IMPLANT MATERIAL WAS TEDIOUSLY REMOVED, THE POCKETS WERE IRRIGATED WITH COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF SALINE FOLLOWED BY KANAMYCIN SOLUTION AND ALL VISIBLE SILICONE WAS REMOVED. THEN DR PROCEEDED WITH BILATERAL FORMAL CAPSULECTOMIES AND AGAIN THIS WAS SKELETONIZED OFF THE BREAST TISSUE AND THE ENTIRE CAPSULES WERE REMOVED. THERE WERE MULTIPLE SILICONE GRANULOMAS, WORSE ON THE LEFT SIDE THAN ON THE RIGHT, WITH A LOT OF FREE SILICONE IN THE FATTY TISSUE. AGAIN IRRIGATION TOOK PLACE. THE POCKETS WERE ADJUSTED AND EXPANDED WHERE NECESSARY FOR SYMMETRY AND THEN PREPLACED INTRAMAMMARY SUTURES OF INTERRUPTED 3-0 VICRYL WERE ULTILIZED. A 15MM BLAKE DRAIN WAS LEFT IN PLACE ON EACH SIDE. BECAUSE OF THE BREAST ASYMMETRY WITH THE RIGHT BREAST ACTUALLY BEING LARGER THAN THE LEFT FROM BREAST TISSUE, NOT ONLY PREOPERATIVELY, BUT DR HAD TO REMOVE MORE ON THE LEFT SIDE. DR PUT A 340CC MCGHAN HIGH PROFILE TEXTURED ROUND IMPLANT ON THE LEFT SIDE AND A 300CC ON THE RIGHT SIDE. SUTURES WERE TIED DOWN AND TRANSECTED. BREASTS WERE CLOSED WITH INTERRUPTED BURIED 4-0 AND 5-0 VICRYL FOLLOWED BY STERI-STRIPS. THE PT WAS THEN PLACED IN A CUSTOM BRA AND DRESSING. BLOOD LOSS WAS LESS THAN 100CC. NO PRODUCTS WERE GIVEN. THE PT WAS AWAKE AND LEFT THE OPERATING ROOM PER ANESTHESIA.|UNK|*|12/19/2001|V||27 YR|Y||357139.0||FTR|1.0||SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS|Y|*|UNK|UNK|UNK|*|UNK|UNK||||*|*|True

PRIOR TO THE SURGERY, MENTOR SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS AND SIZERS WERE ORDERED AND SHIPPED TO CAPE COD HOSPITAL. THE IMPLANTS AND SIZERS ARRIVED IN THE SAME SHIPPING BOX; EACH IN THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL BOXES WRAPPED IN PLASTIC. PRIOR TO THE SURGICAL CASE STARTING ON THE SAME DAY, THE CIRCULATING NURSE RETRIEVED THE IMPLANTS AND SIZERS FROM THE STORAGE AREA AND BROUGHT THEM INTO THE OR ROOM. WHEN THE SURGEON REQUESTED A PARTICULAR SIZER, THE CIRCULATING NURSE REMOVED IT FROM THE BOX AND TRANSFERRED IT ONTO THE SURGICAL FIELD. THE SURGEON PLACED THE SIZER INTO THE PATIENT. THE TRANSFER OF THE SIZER ONTO THE SURGICAL FIELD HAD BEEN SOME WHAT DIFFICULT AND PROMPTED THE CRNA TO QUESTION WHETHER THE SIZER WAS STERILE. THE CRNA HAD A PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE AT ANOTHER FACILITY WHERE A NON STERILE SIZER WAS USED. THE TRASH WAS CHECKED AND THE SIZER BOX WAS INSPECTED. STAFF THEN SAW A SMALL TRIANGLE ON THE BOX 6.5 X 2.5 LABEL ( ON THE SIDE OF THE BOX) THAT STATED PRODUCT WAS NON-STERILE. THE SIZER WAS REMOVED FROM THE PATIENT AND THE AREA WAS IRRIGATED WITH SALINE AND NEOBACIN. ACCORDING TO THE SURGEON, THE PATIENT HAS NOT EXPERIENCED ANY COMPLICATIONS FROM HER SURGERY. THIS EVENT PROMPTED A MULTIDISCIPLINARY REVIEW. AS A RESULT OF OUR REVIEW, WE WILL BE EVALUATING OUR OWN INTERNAL SYSTEMS TO ENSURE THAT NON-STERILE PRODUCTS LIKE THIS ARE INTERCEPTED PRIOR TO BEING BROUGHT INTO THE OR. WE ALSO IDENTIFIED SEVERAL ISSUES RELATED TO THE PACKAGING/LABELING OF THE PRODUCT THAT WE FEEL CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT: STERILE IMPLANTS AND UNSTERILE SIZERS WERE PACKAGED IN IDENTICAL BOXES AND WRAPPED IN PLASTIC. THE WORDS ""NON-STERILE"" WERE ON THE SIZER LABEL IN SMALL FONT ON TWO DIFFERENT LINES (THE CIRCULATING NURSE MOST LIKELY MADE A PATTERN MAPPING ERROR WHEN SHE EXPECTED BOTH PRODUCTS TO BE STERILE AND SAW ONLY THE WORD STERILE ON THE EXTERNAL PACKAGE). SEE ATTACHED PICTURE OF LABEL. ANOTHER PATTERN-MAPPING ERROR MOST LIKELY OCCURRED WHEN THE CIRCULATING NURSE EXPECTED THE SIZER TO BE STERILE AND SAW THAT THE PRODUCT WAS PEEL PACKED - TYPICAL FOR STERILE PRODUCTS. THE CRNA REMEMBERED A SIMILAR INCIDENT AT ANOTHER FACILITY WHERE THE SIZER USED WAS NOT STERILE - INDICATING THAT OUR EVENT WAS NOT AN ISOLATED CASE. WE HAVE RECOMMENDED TO MENTOR CORPORATION THEY UNDERTAKE A REVIEW OF THE PACKAGING AND LABELING OF THE NON-STERILE SIZERS AND MAKE CHANGES TO ASSIST END USERS IN READILY AND CLEARLY IDENTIFYING THE PRODUCT AS NON-STERILE."|MEMORY GEL||03/25/2008|B|||Y||987362.0|0HP|FTR|1.0||BREAST IMPLANT SIZER|N||||IRVING|US|MENTOR CORPORATION||TX|75038||||True

INITIAL CLINICAL PRESENTATION (B)(6) 2010. THIS IS (B)(6) FEMALE WITH A HISTORY OF DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU OF THE LEFT BREAST DIAGNOSED IN 1998. SHE SUBSEQUENTLY UNDERWENT A LEFT MASTECTOMY WHERE THE SPECIMEN WEIGHT WAS 596 GRAMS. SHE UNDERWENT IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION WITH PLACEMENT OF SUBMUSCULAR TISSUE EXPANDER BY PLASTIC SURGEON #1. THE TISSUE EXPANDER WAS PLACED COMPLETELY SUBPECTORAL AND ALSO IN A SUBSERRATUS POCKET. THE EXPANDER WAS REMOVED IN 1999 AND REPLACED WITH A MCGHAN 440 ML DUAL-CHAMBER SILICONE AND SALINE-FILLED IMPLANT. SHE RECEIVED NO POSTOPERATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY OR RADIATION THERAPY. WITHIN A YEAR, SHE DEVELOPED SIGNIFICANT HARDENING AND DISTORTION OF THE LEFT RECONSTRUCTED BREAST WITH GRADUAL ELEVATION OF THE IMPLANT, TIGHTENING OF THE TISSUE AROUND THE IMPLANT, AND DISCOMFORT IN THE LEFT CHEST WALL. SHE WAS SEEN IN EVALUATION IN 2006 BY PLASTIC SURGEON #2, WHO RE-OPERATED ON HER LEFT BREAST AND REMOVED THE EXISTING IMPLANT, PERFORMED PERIPROSTHETIC CAPSULOTOMIES WHICH WERE NOT SPECIFIED IN THE OPERATIVE NOTE, SUBMITTED CAPSULAR TISSUE FOR HISTOLOGIC EXAMINATION (INTERPRETED AS NEGATIVE) AND REPLACED A SMALLER SALINE IMPLANT. THIS WAS AN ALLERGAN-STYLE 68MP SALINE IMPLANT, SIZE 390-420 ML. THIS RECONSTRUCTION WAS SOFT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, BUT WITHIN 1 YEAR, SHE HAD RECURRENCE OF THE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE WITH TIGHTENING OF THE TISSUE AROUND THE IMPLANT, GRADUAL ELEVATION OF THE IMPLANT LOCATION, AND DISCOMFORT IN THE LEFT CHEST WALL. SHE WAS SEEN IN EVALUATION IN 2009 BY PLASTIC SURGEON #4 WHO RECOMMENDED THAT SHE CONSIDER REVISION OF HER RECONSTRUCTION WITH THE ADDITION OF AN CELLULAR DERMAL MATRIX TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR RECURRENCE OF HER CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE AROUND THE DEVICE. PLASTIC SURGEON #4 ALSO RECOMMENDED AUTOLOGOUS ABDOMINAL FLAP RECONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES. THE PT WAS INTERESTED IN CONSIDERING A DIEP FLAP AND PLASTIC SURGEON #4 REFERRED HER TO ME ((B)(6) SURGEON #5) FOR EVALUATION AND CONSIDERATION OF A FREE FLAP BREAST RECONSTRUCTION PROCEDURE. THE PT'S PAST MEDICAL HISTORY WAS ADDITIONALLY SIGNIFICANT FOR A HISTORY OF HYPOTHYROIDISM AND BLADDER PROLAPSE. HER MEDICATIONS INCLUDED SYNTHROID 88 MCG DAILY, VITAMIN D, AND ADVIL. SHE IS A NONSMOKER AND DRINKS ALCOHOL RARELY. INITIAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION, (B)(6) 2010, SHOWED THE PT WAS 155 CM TALL, 70.3 KG. THE LEFT BREAST WAS ABSENT THROUGH A TRANSVERSE STEWART-TYPE MASTECTOMY INCISION. THERE WAS AN IMPLANT PRESENT IN THE SUBPECTORAL POSITION ON THE LEFT SIDE. THERE WAS A BAKER GRADE IV CAPSULE CONTRACTURE AROUND THIS DEVICE, WHICH WAS RIGIDLY AFFIXED TO HER CHEST WALL AND SOMEWHAT TENDER TO MANIPULATION. THE WOUNDS WERE WELL HEALED WITH NO EVIDENCE OF SCAR HYPERTROPHY. THE RIGHT BREAST WAS MORE PTOTIC WITH A DEGREE OF PSEUDOPTOSIS, LATERAL BOTTOMING OUT AND A WISE-PATTERN SCAR FROM PREVIOUS MASTOPEXY - RESULTING IN SUBSTANTIAL SHAPE AND VOLUME ASYMMETRY. ON THE LEFT SIDE, THE STERNAL NOTCH TO INFRAMAMMARY FOLD DISTANCE WAS 20 CM. ON THE RIGHT SIDE, THE STERNAL NOTCH TO INFRAMAMMARY FOLD DISTANCE WAS 23 CM. THE MID-CLAVICULAR POINT TO NIPPLE DISTANCE ON THE RIGHT WAS 21 CM. EXAMINATION OF THE ABDOMEN SHOWED A GENEROUS AMOUNT OF TISSUE IN THE LOWER 1/3 OF THE ABDOMEN FOR ABDOMINAL FLAP CONSIDERATION. INITIAL IMPRESSION, (B)(6) 2010. THIS WAS A (B)(6) FEMALE WITH RECURRENT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE FOLLOWING 2 PREVIOUS IMPLANT-BASED RECONSTRUCTION SURGERIES ON THE LEFT SIDE. THE LEFT BREAST RECONSTRUCTION SHOWED ELEVATION OF THE INFRAMAMMARY FOLD AND A SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE AROUND THE EXISTING IMPLANT. I RECOMMENDED REMOVAL OF THE EXISTING LEFT BREAST IMPLANT, RECONSTRUCTION OF THE ORIGINS OF THE LEFT PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE AND RECONSTRUCTION OF THE LEFT BREAST WITH A FREE ABDOMINAL FLAP. OPERATIVE FINDINGS ON (B)(6) 2011: THE LEFT BREAST IMPLANT CAPSULE WAS OPENED AND CONTAINED A CLOUDY YELLOW FLUID UNDER ENORMOUS PRESSURE, THE FLUID SQUIRTED OUT OF THE CAPSULAR INCISION AND TRAVELED AT LEAST 56 INCHES. THERE WAS A COLLECTION OF GELATINOUS MATERIAL WITHIN THE CAPSULE AS WELL AS AN INTACT SALINE BREAST IMPLANT. THE CAPSULE WAS THICKENED AND COVERED WITH PLAQUE-LIKE LESIONS INTERNALLY. A TOTAL CAPSULECTOMY WAS PERFORMED, THE PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE WAS REATTACHED TO ITS 5TH RIB ORIGINS. THE PERIPROSTHETIC FLUID WAS CAPTURED, AND ALL MATERIAL WAS SENT FOR PATHOLOGIC AND CYTOLOGIC EVALUATION INCLUDING FROZEN SECTION WHICH WAS CONSISTENT WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF ALCL. THE REMAINING RECONSTRUCTION WAS ABANDONED PENDING FINAL PATHOLOGY EVALUATION SPECIMEN. DETAILED PATHOLOGY FINDINGS: LEFT BREAST PERI-PROSTHETIC MATERIAL.

2163607|2106125|D|1||"I'M WRITING MY STORY TO THE FDA. THIS IS ABOUT MY BREAST SILICONE IMPLANTS THAT HAVE BEEN BLEEDING OUT FOR 7 OR MORE YEARS. I STARTED TO CONTINUALLY TO BE SICK WITH SYMPTOMS LIKE: LOW GRADE FEVERS 99.6 TO 100.8 (ALL THE TIME), FATIGUE, SWOLLEN LYMPH NODES, FLU-LIKE SYMPTOMS, NIGHT SWEATS, INSOMNIA, BACKACHES, WEIGHT LOSS, WEIGHT GAIN, BONES HURTING, CANKER SORES IN MY MOUTH FOR 4 MONTHS AND ON AND OFF FOR 2 YEARS, LARGE SUB LINGUAL TONSILS, COUGHING, WEAKNESS, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, CHEST PAINS, PAIN DEEP IN THE BONES, MEMORY LOSS. UNTIL (B)(6) 2007, WHEN MY BLOOD PRESSURE WENT UP AND I STARTED GETTING CHEST PAINS, THEN I SAW MY CARDIOLOGIST. HE RAN ALL THE TESTS, ECHO, THALLIUM TREADMILL AND BP MONITOR WITH BLOOD TESTS. ALL THE TESTS CAME BACK NEGATIVE EXCEPT FOR MY CRP, IT WAS 20.6. THIS HAD MY CARDIOLOGIST CONCERNED. HE ASKED THAT I RETURNED IN 2 MONTHS FOR A REPEAT TEST TO SEE IF IT WAS STILL HIGH 20.1. IN (B)(6), THE TEST WAS REPEATED WITH THE SAME RESULT 20.1. SENT ME FOR A CHEST CT SCAN. CAME BACK ABNORMAL AGAIN. MY CT SHOWED MANY SPOTS WITH INFILTRATES IN BOTH LUNGS AND PATCHY SPOTS WITH ABNORMAL LYMPH NODES. HE REFERRED ME TO A PULMONOLOGIST; SHE SAID I NEED A LYMPH NODE BIOPSY IN MY AXILLARY'S NODES, WANTED TO R/O LYMPHOMA. SHE HAD MORE BLOOD TEST DONE AND MY CPR WAS UP TO 43 AND SED RATE WAS UP, WBC WAS UP, BLOOD WORK IS STARTING TO COME BACK ABNORMAL. SHE REFERRED ME TO A GENERAL SURGEON TO PERFORM THE BIOPSY AND THE BIOPSY CAME BACK SHOWING SILICONE IN THE LYMPH NODES AND ALSO IN MY MEDIA-STERNUM FROM THE LAST BIOPSY. THE DOCTORS ARE NOW SAYING THIS HAS BEEN LEAKING INTO SYSTEM SLOWLY SINCE BEFORE 2004 AND MY AUTOIMMUNE SYSTEM HAS BEEN FIGHTING, WHICH IS WHY I HAVE BEEN SO SICK. WELL, THE 1ST SURGERY WAS ON (B)(6) 2007. THE INCISIONS ARE ABOUT 3IN ON BOTH SIDE OF MY PELVIC AREA. THIS SURGERY WILL BE DIVIDING THE INFERIOR EPIGASTRIC BLOOD VESSELS, TRAINING THE TRAM TISSUES TO RELY ON THE SUPERIOR EPIGASTRIC SYSTEM. THIS STEP IS NOT REQUIRED FOR SUCCESSFUL PEDICLE TRAM RECONSTRUCTION BUT CAN IMPROVE BLOOD SUPPLY TO THE FLAP. SO-CALLED DELAY PROCEDURES MAY EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY OF PERFORMING MICROSURGERY (""SUPERCHARGING"") IF THE PEDICLE FLAP HAS ANY ARTERIAL OR VENOUS INSUFFICIENCY PROBLEMS, SINCE THE VESSELS DIVIDED IN THE ""DELAY"" CANNOT BE USED. IT IS INFECTING MY LUNGS AND IMMUNE SYSTEM AND OTHER MAJOR ORGANS. IN ALL I HAD A MINIMUM OF 13 MAJOR SURGERIES WHICH INCLUDE MORE RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY AND WOUND CARE, DEVELOP NECROSIS FROM THE SURGERY, ALL THE SILICONE COULD NOT BE REMOVED. I HAD DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH AND THERE IS VERY LITTLE ABOUT MY CONDITION AND SILICONE ILLNESS. BOTH THE SURGEON AND PLASTIC SURGEON HAVE SAID THIS IS A VERY RARE CONDITION. ON (B)(6) 2007, BILATERAL PEDICLES TRAM FLAP WITH THE REMOVAL OF SILICONE IMPLANTS. BOTH IMPLANTS WERE RUPTURED AND BLEEDING OUT, MORE ON THE LEFT THEN ON THE RIGHT SIDE. BUT THE PLASTIC SURGEON -PS- SAID THESE HAVE BEEN LEAKING FOR A LONG TIME. THE PS CLEANED ALL THE AREA WHILE NOT TO DISTURB THE BLOOD VESSEL FOR THE TRAM FLAPS. THE PS USED THE SKIN OF THE BREASTS FROM WHERE HE REMOVED THE IMPLANTS AND TRANSPLANTED THE FLAPS BILATERALLY TO KEEP ME THE SAME SIZE AND SYMMETRICALLY. THE ABDOMEN REPAIR ""TUMMY TUCK"". THERE HAS BEEN SOME BRUISING AROUND THE ""NEW PLACEMENT"" OF THE BELLY BUTTON AND ABDOMEN AROUND THERE. THE PS USED MESH FOR MY ABDOMEN INSTEAD OF ALLODERM, BECAUSE THE MESH WAS STRONGER. I CAN FEEL THAT MESH WHEN I WALK. I WAS IN SURGERY FOR 8 1/2 HOURS AND SUFFERED RESPIRATORY FAILURE WITH PULMONARY EDEMA WITHIN THE FIRST 24 HOURS. I WAS MOVED TO THE FLOOR AND DEVELOPED PNEUMONIA IN THE RIGHT LOWER LOBE. I SWEAR, I WAS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT BASED ON BREATHING. ANTIBIOTICS PUSH AND LASIX PUSH AND PLENTY OF RESPIRATORY THERAPY, WHEN I GOT HOME I HAD EXTRA EQUIPMENT OXYGEN, WALKER, AND HOSPITAL BED. I WAS ON A LOT OF ANTIBIOTICS AND PAIN PILLS. I WENT TO THE DOCTOR AND IT LOOKS LIKE I'M GOING TO BE ADMITTED BACK INTO THE HOSPITAL ON (B)(6) 2008 FOR MORE SURGERY FOR A WOUND THAT DEVELOPED IN THE ABDOMEN. THE SURGERY IS FOR DEBRIDEMENT OF THE WOUND THAT IS NOT HEALING AND PLACING A WOUND VAC ON IT. THE DOCTOR WILL HAVE TO REDO 8 INCHES OF THE INCISION. I WILL BE IN THE HOSPITAL FOR 2-3 DAYS; I WILL HAVE TO PRAY MORE. THE SURGERY IS SUPPOSED TO TAKE 1 TO 1 1/2 HOUR; WITH THE COMPLICATIONS OF MY LUNGS THAT TIME SHOULDN'T BE TOO BAD. I WAS AFRAID OF DEVELOPING INFECTION, (B)(6). THEN 6 WEEKS OF THE WOUND VAC ON MY ABDOMEN. I DID DEVELOP (B)(6) AND WAS HOSPITALIZE FOR 4 MONTHS IN 2008. I HAVE STARTED TO SEE THE TRANSPLANTATION TEAM TO HAVE A POSSIBLE LUNG REMOVED BEFORE I RUN OUT OF TIME. BOTH LUNGS ARE FILLED WITH SILICONE, AS WELL AS MY KIDNEYS, AND MY GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT. MY PULMONARY DOCTOR I HAVE HAS BEEN WITH ME FOR 4 YEARS, AND SHE HAS SEEN ME GET WORSE THROUGH ON-GOING TESTS AND YEARS. WITH THE LUNG BIOPSIES (B)(6) 2011, SHOWING SILICONE THROUGHOUT MY LUNGS, SHE THEN SAW MY LAST PFTS AND IT WAS WORSE BY 80% SINCE (B)(6) 2011, AND MY O2 LEVEL IS AT 7 LITERS NOW. IT HAS GONE UP BY 3 LITERS SINCE (B)(6) 2010. SO CURRENTLY, I AM GOING THROUGH THE PRE-TESTING FOR LUNG TRANSPLANTS TO SEE IF I QUALIFY FOR THE TRANSPLANTS. SO I HAVE TO GO THROUGH A LOT OF TESTING TO SEE IF MY BODY CAN HANDLE THE TRANSPLANTS. ONLY MY DOCTOR UNDERSTANDS EVERYTHING ABOUT WHAT IMPLANTS CAN DO TO YOU. SHE HAS SEEN ME GO THROUGH IT A LOT. WHEN MY IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED IN 2007, THE DOCTOR HAD TO LEAVE THE OUTER PART IN BECAUSE MY TISSUE WAS ALREADY TAKEN OVER. MY IMPLANTS HAD BEEN LEAKING UP TO 7 YEARS PER THE TIMELINE OF ALL THE ISSUE WITH MY HEALTH PER MY DOCTORS. I HOPE THE LUNG TRANSPLANTS WILL BE APPROVE TO PLACE ME ON THE ORGAN TRANSPLANT LIST. SILICONE IMPLANTS SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL MORE AND NEW UPDATED RESEARCH IS DONE.

SURGERY WAS UNEVENTFUL, I HAD HUGE SWELLING UPPER LEFT BREAST AREA POST SURGERY. I WAS DISCHARGED THE NEXT DAY WITH 2 BREAST DRAINS AND INSTRUCTED TO FOLLOW-UP WITH SURGEON. I FOLLOWED UP WITH MY PLASTIC SURGEON AT LEAST TWICE A WEEK. BREAST SURGERY WAS VERY PAINFUL. ON THIRD WEEK POST-SURGERY, I HAD SEVERAL MEDICAL COMPLAINTS: HEADACHE, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, NUMBNESS OF FACE, AND EVENTUALLY MOTTLING, REDNESS AND SWELLING OF LEFT BREAST, SWELLING ON PORT BELOW INTRA-MAMMARY FOLD. I HAD SEVERAL VISITS TO URGENT CARE, EMERGENCY HOSPITAL, AND DOCTORS' OFFICES. I DEVELOPED FEVER AND CELLULITIS ON BREAST; WHICH FELT LIKE A BALLOON. I WENT TO URGENT CARE ON (B)(6) 2012; WAS GIVEN VANCOMYCIN IV. THE NEXT DAY, I FELT THAT THE LEFT BREAST DEFLATED AND AREA AROUND PORT (INTRA-MAMMARY FOLD) FILLED WITH MORE FLUID. I SAW MY SURGEON WHO ORDERED ADMISSION TO HOSPITAL FOR SURGICAL EXPLANTATION, IRRIGATION, AND DEBRIDEMENT. SURGERY WAS PERFORMED ON THE NEXT DAY, (B)(6) 2012. CLOUDY SEROMA AND GRANULATION TISSUE WAS EVACUATED AND SALINE BREAST EXPANDER AND PORT WAS REMOVED.

SHE SAID THAT THE IMPLANT WILL BE SUBMITTED FOR EXAMINATION AND THEN RETURNED TO MFR. I WAS GIVEN CONTINUOUS VANCOMYCIN TREATMENT FOR 2 DAYS AND WAS PRESCRIBED CIPRO AND ORAL PAIN MEDS. I HAD FOLLOW-UP VISITS AT HER OFFICE AND 2 DRAIN TUBES WERE REMOVED AFTER SEVERAL DAYS. THE INITIAL CULTURE TEST RESULTS AT (B)(6) CAME OUT AS ACID-FAST BACILLI, A FAST GROWER. I SAW AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR FOR EMPIRICAL TREATMENT WHILE WAITING FOR SENSITIVITY TESTING RESULTS. I STARTED WITH A COMBINATION TREATMENT OF CLARITHROMYCIN AND DOXYCYCLINE.

RESULTS OF THE TEST IDENTIFIED AS M. FORTUITUM, SENSITIVE TO CLARITHROMYCIN, BUT RESISTANT TO DOXYCYCLINE.

I FINALLY CONSULTED WITH (B)(6); WELL KNOWN EXPERTS IN DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF MYCOBACTERIAL INFECTIONS. I WANTED TO GET A ""DEFINITE REGARDING CAUSE"" OF PERSISTENT FIBRINOUS NODULAR TISSUE ON MY LEFT BREAST AND AXILLA.

ASSESSMENT WAS POSSIBLE MYCOBACTERIUM FORTUITUM IATROGENIC HEALTH CARE ASSOCIATED INFECTION OF THE LEFT BREAST IMPLANT. BECAUSE OF ABSENCE OF PERI-OPERATIVE PATHOLOGY TO LOOK FOR GRANULOMAS, NOR ABILITY TO RE-CULTURE THE SITE, PLAN WAS TO GET MRI OF RESIDUAL BREAST TISSUE AND CONSULT WITH SURGEON WHO SPECIALIZED IN MYCOBACTERIAL INFECTIONS. MRI RESULTS: SOME ABNORMAL FINDINGS, BUT COULD NOT RULE OUT IF THIS IS DUE TO INFECTIOUS DISEASE OR POST-SURGICAL CHANGES. I SAW A SURGEON AT (B)(6). SHE CONCURRED WITH (B)(6) TREATMENT OF 6 MONTHS ANTIBIOTICS AND RETURN APPOINTMENT FOR REASSESSMENT IN 3 MONTHS. ANTIBIOTIC COMBINATION WERE PRESCRIBED, CHANGED FROM TIME TO TIME TO PREVENT BACTERIAL RESISTANCE AND SIDE EFFECTS.

ON (B)(6) 2012, I HAD A RETURN DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT AND MRI AND BLOOD TEST AT (B)(6). SURGEON'S ASSESSMENT WAS THAT I HAVE NO APPARENT LESION OF MYCOBACTERIAL DISEASE. MY INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR WITHDREW ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT ON (B)(6). I STARTED HAVING STOMACH PAINS RIGHT AFTER I WITHDREW MY ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT. THE PAIN CONTINUED AND SPREAD ON THE ABDOMEN SPECIALLY ON THE LEFT LOWER QUADRANT. MY OBGYN DOCTOR PERFORMED ENDOMETRIAL BIOPSY WHICH RESULT WAS NEGATIVE. MY GASTROENTEROLOGIST ALSO PERFORMED COLONOSCOPY LAST WEEK AND AWAITING FOR RESULTS OF THE BIOPSY. HE SUGGESTED BREATH TEST TO RULE OUT SIBO.

THERE WAS NO TREATMENT GIVEN THE PT AT THAT TIME. FROM THAT TIME UNTIL (B)(6) 2014 THE PT STILL DID NOT FEEL VERY WELL. SHE BEGAN A MILD YOGA EXERCISE THAT DAY, AND COMPLAINED OF A SORE CHEST, SO SHE FELT SHE HAD OVERDONE IT. THE HUSBAND NOTICED SHE WAS RETAINING FLUID. ON (B)(6) 2014, SHE FELT SHE HAD THE FLU, WITH MALAISE/HIGH FEVER, AND THEN DEVELOPED VOMITING AND DIARRHEA. AT 1 AM ON (B)(6) 2014, THE PT ROLLED OFF THE BED, WAS DELIRIOUS, BUT STILL COMMUNICATIVE. HER TEMPERATURE WAS 103. SHE ""WENT UNCONSCIOUS BUT WAS RESPONSIVE"" AND HER HUSBAND CALLED 911. WHEN THE EMTS ARRIVED THEREAFTER, SHE HAD NO PULSE. IN THE ER, HER BP WAS 60/12. ""SHE WAS ON A VENTILATOR AND IN THE ICU IMMEDIATELY, ON STEROIDS, PRESSORS, AND IN AN INDUCED COMA FOR 4-5 DAYS. HER RIGHT BREAST WAS SO STRETCHED FROM SWELLING WITH INFECTION THAT YOU COULD SEE CLEAR FLUID WEEPING FROM IT. THERE WAS MUCH CLEAR FLUID FROM THE MASTECTOMY. SHE WAS ON DIALYSIS. SHE ACTUALLY STARTED TO IMPROVE AFTER SHE WAS EXPLANTED. THE SWELLING DECREASED, MEDS WERE BEING WEANED, BUT HER SKIN WAS SLOUGHING. HER FINGERTIPS, HER FEET WERE TURNING BLACK."" THE PT'S DATE OF DEATH WAS (B)(6) 2014. THE PT'S HUSBAND VERIFIED THE PROVISIONAL DEATH CERTIFICATE LISTED THE CAUSE OF DEATH AS COMPLICATIONS OF BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY/TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME.

DEVICE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. CALCIUM DEPOSITS CAN FORM IN THE TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT WITH SYMPTOMS THAT MAY INCLUDE PAIN AND FIRMNESS. LYMPHADENOPATHY HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED IN SOME WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS. POSTOPERATIVE HEMATOMA AND SEROMA MAY BE MINIMIZED BY METICULOUS ATTENTION TO HEMOSTASIS DURING SURGERY, AND POSSIBLY ALSO BY POSTOPERATIVE USE OF A CLOSED DRAINAGE SYSTEM. PERSISTENT, EXCESSIVE BLEEDING MUST BE CONTROLLED BEFORE IMPLANTATION. ANY POSTOPERATIVE EVACUATION OF HEMATOMA OR SEROMA MUST BE CONDUCTED WITH CARE TO AVOID BREAST IMPLANT CONTAMINATION OR DAMAGE FROM SHARP INSTRUMENTS. USE CARE IN SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURES SUCH AS OPEN CAPSULOTOMY, BREAST POCKET REVISION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA ASPIRATION, AND BIOPSY/LUMPECTOMY TO AVOID DAMAGE TO THE IMPLANT. THE (B)(4) STUDY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE LONG-TERM ((B)(4)) SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, ALLERGAN HAS INITIATED A SEPARATE (B)(4) POST-APPROVAL STUDY ((B)(4)) TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC ISSUES WHICH ALLERGAN'S CORE STUDY WAS NOT DESIGNED TO FULLY ANSWER, AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE A REAL-WORLD ASSESSMENT OF SOME ENDPOINTS.

4702227|13234344|N|1||(B)(4). DEVICE LABELING: BASED ON INFORMATION TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGAN'S AND OTHER MANUFACTURER'S BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. THERE WERE 9 PRIMARY AUGMENTATION PATIENTS (1.9%) WITH A NEW DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER THROUGH 10 YEARS IN THE ALLERGAN PIVOTAL STUDY. IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION PATIENTS, THERE WAS 1 REPORT OF SKIN CANCER AND 1 REPORT OF RENAL CELL CANCER, AND 1 PRIMARY AUGMENTATION PATIENT WHO WAS PREGNANT AT THE TIME OF IMPLANTATION GAVE BIRTH TO A CHILD WHO LATER DEVELOPED HISTIOCYTOSIS. THERE WAS 1 REVISION-AUGMENTATION PATIENT (0.8%) WITH A NEW DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER THROUGH 10 YEARS AND 1 PATIENT REPORT OF BLADDER CANCER AND 1 PATIENT REPORT OF MULTIPLE MYELOMA. THERE WERE 17 RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS (7.6%) WITH RECURRENCE OF BREAST CANCER THROUGH 10 YEARS, 1 REPORT OF NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA AND 1 REPORT OF UTERINE CANCER. THERE WERE NO REVISION-RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS WHO REPORTED A RECURRENCE OF BREAST CANCER THROUGH 10 YEARS AND NO REPORTS OF OTHER CANCERS IN REVISION-RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. ONE RECONSTRUCTION PATIENT IN THE PIVOTAL STUDY WAS REPORTED WITH ALCL THROUGH 10 YEARS. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. LITERATURE REPORTS HAVE ALSO BEEN MADE ASSOCIATING SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS WITH VARIOUS RHEUMATOLOGICAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS SUCH AS FATIGUE, EXHAUSTION, JOINT PAIN AND SWELLING, MUSCLE PAIN AND CRAMPING, TINGLING, NUMBNESS, WEAKNESS, AND SKIN RASHES.|STYLE 410 COHESIVE SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|MF-410335|04/16/2015||02/25/2013|DA|Y|Y||0HP|FTR|1.0|02/02/2011|nan||1223847|||ARKLOW, COUNTY WICKLOW|EI|ALLERGAN|||||||True

PUBLISHED STUDIES INDICATE THAT BREAST CANCER IS NO MORE COMMON IN WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS THAN THOSE WITHOUT IMPLANTS. A LARGE, LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP FOUND NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE RISK RATES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CANCERS, INCLUDING STOMACH CANCER, LEUKEMIA, AND LYMPHOMA. PTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE.

5222818|31178939|N|1||(B)(4). DEVICE LABELING: BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. IN THE PASS STUDY, AT LEAST 1 REOPERATION WAS PERFORMED ON 315 PATIENTS (36.5%) THROUGH 10 YEARS. A TOTAL OF 424 REOPERATIONS WERE PERFORMED. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR REOPERATION THROUGH 10 YEARS ON AUGMENTATION PATIENTS WAS IMPLANT DEFLATION AT 21.7%. THE PERCENTAGE OF REOPERATIONS DUE TO LUMP/MASS/CYST INCREASED FROM 8.5% OF 293 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 5 YEARS TO 13.9% OF 424 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 10 YEARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF LUMPS, MASSES, AND CYSTS CAN BE EXPECTED TO NATURALLY INCREASE AS PATIENTS AGE AND COULD BE AN EXPLANATION FOR THE INCREASE. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, ASYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. OF THE 237 PATIENTS IN THE R95 STUDY, AT LEAST 1 REOPERATION WAS PERFORMED ON 99 PATIENTS (42%) FOR A TOTAL OF 125 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 5 YEARS. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR REOPERATION THROUGH 5 YEARS WAS CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE AT 25.6%. OF THE 237 RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS IN R95, THERE WERE 62 PATIENTS (26.2%) WHO HAD 70 IMPLANTS REMOVED THROUGH 5 YEARS. OF THE 70 RECONSTRUCTION IMPLANTS REMOVED THROUGH 5 YEARS, 70% WERE REPLACED. THE MOST COMMON REASON FOR IMPLANT REMOVAL WAS CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE (31.4%). THROUGH 10 YEARS, THERE WERE 104 IMPLANTS REMOVED FROM 85 PATIENTS. THE MOST COMMON REASON FOR IMPLANT REMOVAL WAS IMPLANT LEAKAGE/DEFLATION (32.7%).|STYLE 363 SALINE FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|363LF-410|11/13/2015||||N|R||0HP|FWM|1.0|10/09/2005|PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||569053|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True
4902572|14225628|N|1||UNIQUE IDENTIFIER (UDI) # NA. MEDWATCH SUBMITTED TO THE FDA ON 07/08/2015. DEVICE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENT THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, ASYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. BASED ON INFO REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL) A TYPE OF NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGAN'S AND OTHER MFRS' BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBLY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REP PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WITH DEFORMITY. CALCIUM DEPOSITS CAN FORM IN THE TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT WITH SYMPTOMS THAT MAY INCLUDE PAIN AND FIRMNESS. LYMPHADENOPATHY HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED IN SOME WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS. PTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADD'L SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER THESE ADD'L SURGERIES.

DEVICE LABELING: IN ADDITION, CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED REGARDING POTENTIAL DAMAGING EFFECTS ON CHILDREN BORN TO MOTHERS WITH IMPLANTS. TWO STUDIES IN HUMANS HAVE FOUND THAT THE RISK OF BIRTH DEFECTS OVERALL IS NOT INCREASED IN CHILDREN BORN AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY. ALTHOUGH LOW BIRTH WEIGHT WAS REPORTED IN A THIRD STUDY, OTHER FACTORS (FOR EXAMPLE, LOWER PRE-PREGNANCY WEIGHT) MAY EXPLAIN THIS FINDING. THIS AUTHOR RECOMMENDED FURTHER RESEARCH ON INFANT HEALTH. A REVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE DID NOT FIND THAT OFFSPRING OF WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS WERE AT AN INCREASED RISK FOR ESOPHAGEAL DISORDERS, RHEUMATIC DISEASES, OR CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS. IF YOU HAVE A PATIENT WHO HAS EXPERIENCED ONE OR MORE SERIOUS PROBLEMS RELATED TO HER BREAST IMPLANTS, YOU ARE ENCOURAGED TO REPORT THE SERIOUS PROBLEM(S) TO THE FDA THROUGH THE MEDWATCH VOLUNTARY REPORTING SYSTEM FOR HER. EXAMPLES OF SERIOUS PROBLEMS INCLUDE DISABILITY, HOSPITALIZATION, HARM TO OFFSPRING, AND MEDICAL OR SURGICAL INTERVENTION TO PREVENT LASTING DAMAGE. THIRTY-SIX (B)(4) OF THE PRIMARY AUGMENTATION PATIENTS IN THE (B)(6) STUDY REPORTED A REPRODUCTION PROBLEM THROUGH 10 YEARS, MOST COMMONLY MISCARRIAGE. SIX (B)(4) REVISION-AUGMENTATION PATIENTS EXPERIENCED A REPRODUCTION PROBLEM, MOST COMMONLY MISCARRIAGE, THROUGH 10 YEARS.

FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTER REGARDING EVENT, PRODUCT, OR PATIENT DETAILS HAS BEEN REQUESTED. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. DEVICE LABELING ADDRESSES: ""BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: ...REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, INFECTION. PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER THESE ADDITIONAL SURGERIES. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF DEFLATION.""

THE DARN IMPLANTS HAVE BEEN LEAKING AS PER THE BIOPSY THAT I JUST WAS NOTIFIED ABOUT I HAVE SILICONE IN MY TISSUE EVEN THOUGH MY IMPLANTS DID NOT HAVE A NORMAL BREAK IN THEM. SO MAYBE THE FDA SHOULD HAVE MADE ME AWARE OF HOW UNSAFE SILICONE IMPLANTS BY THIS COMPANY INNAMED OR MCGHAN STYLE 153 DOUBLE LUMEN. THE MRI I DID HAVE COULD NOT TELL FOR SURE ANYTHING I THOUGHT IT COULD HAVE A RUPTURE IN ONE BREAST.
