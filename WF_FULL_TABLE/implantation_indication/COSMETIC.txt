FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTER REGARDING THE EVENT, PRODUCT, AND/OR PATIENT DETAILS WAS REQUESTED. NO FURTHER FOLLOW UP IS POSSIBLE, AS THE CORRESPONDING AUTHOR IS DECEASED. DEVICE LABELING: POSTOPERATIVE HEMATOMA AND SEROMA MAY BE MINIMIZED BY METICULOUS ATTENTION TO HEMOSTASIS DURING SURGERY, AND POSSIBLY BY POSTOPERATIVE USE OF CLOSED DRAINS. PERSISTENT, EXCESSIVE BLEEDING MUST BE CONTROLLED BEFORE THE TISSUE EXPANDER IS PLACED. IF THE WOUND IS STABLE THE TISSUE EXPANDER MAY BE FILLED TO TISSUE TOLERANCE AT THE TIME OF SURGERY TO HELP MINIMIZE SEROUS FLUID ACCUMULATION IN THE SURROUNDING POCKET. IF WOUND STABILITY IS A CONCERN, INFLATE ONLY SLIGHTLY TO FILL THE POCKET SPACE, WITHOUT APPLYING TENSION TO THE TISSUE. ANY POSTOPERATIVE EVACUATION OF HEMATOMA OR OTHER FLUID ACCUMULATION MUST BE CONDUCTED WITH CARE TO AVOID INTRODUCTION OF CONTAMINANTS OR DAMAGE TO THE TISSUE EXPANDER FROM NEEDLES OR OTHER SHARP INSTRUMENTS. POSTOPERATIVE HEMATOMA AND SEROMA MAY CONTRIBUTE TO INFECTION. POSTOPERATIVE HEMATOMA AND SEROMA MAY BE MINIMIZED BY METICULOUS ATTENTION TO HEMOSTASIS DURING SURGERY, AND POSSIBLY BY POSTOPERATIVE USE OF CLOSED DRAINS. PERSISTENT, EXCESSIVE BLEEDING MUST BE CONTROLLED BEFORE THE DEVICE IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY.

DEVICE LABELING: THE STRESSES OF THE EXPANDING DEVICE MAY INDUCE PRESSURE ISCHEMIA AND NECROSIS, ESPECIALLY IN TIGHT OR THIN-SKINNED AREAS. FOLDS IN A PARTIALLY FILLED TISSUE EXPANDER MAY ALSO RESULT IN THINNING AND EROSION OF ADJACENT TISSUE. EXCESSIVELY RAPID TISSUE EXPANSION MAY COMPROMISE THE VASCULARITY OF THE OVERLYING TISSUE. AS EXPECTED FOLLOWING ANY INVASIVE SURGICAL PROCEDURE, PAIN OF VARYING INTENSITY AND DURATION MAY OCCUR FOLLOWING TISSUE EXPANDER PLACEMENT. IN ADDITION, THE EXPANSION PROCESS MAY CAUSE SOME DISCOMFORT, BUT SHOULD NOT CAUSE EXCESSIVE PAIN. PAIN MAY INDICATE EXPANSION BEYOND TISSUE TOLERANCE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN ISCHEMIA AND NECROSIS. PAIN MAY ALSO ACCOMPANY OTHER ADVERSE REACTIONS. UNEXPLAINED PAIN MUST BE PROMPTLY INVESTIGATED. FURTHER EXPANSION SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED UNTIL THE PAIN IS RESOLVED. ACTIVE INFECTION ANYWHERE IN THE BODY MAY INCREASE RISK OF PERIPROSTHETIC INFECTION. DO NOT EXPOSE THE TISSUE EXPANDER OR INJECTION NEEDLES TO CONTAMINANTS, WHICH INCREASE THE RISK OF INFECTION. PATIENTS WHO PRESENT WOUND DEHISCENCE, TISSUE EROSION, ISCHEMIA OR NECROSIS RUN AN INCREASED RISK OF PERIPROSTHETIC INFECTION. MEASURES TO PROTECT SUCH AREAS FROM INFECTION SHOULD BE TAKEN.

THE REPORTED EVENTS ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THESE EVENTS. REPORTED EVENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN THE LABELING: THE OCCURRENCE OF LUMPS, MASSES, AND CYSTS CAN BE EXPECTED TO NATURALLY INCREASE AS PATIENTS AGE AND COULD BE AN EXPLANATION FOR THE INCREASE. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. REPORTS IN THE MEDICAL LITERATURE INDICATE THAT PATIENTS WITH BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT AT A GREATER RISK THAN THOSE WITHOUT BREAST IMPLANTS FOR DEVELOPING BREAST CANCER. REPORTS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT BREAST IMPLANTS MAY INTERFERE WITH OR DELAY BREAST CANCER DETECTION BY MAMMOGRAPHY AND/OR BIOPSY; HOWEVER, OTHER REPORTS IN THE PUBLISHED MEDICAL LITERATURE INDICATE THAT BREAST IMPLANTS NEITHER SIGNIFICANTLY DELAY BREAST CANCER DETECTION NOR ADVERSELY AFFECT CANCER SURVIVAL OF WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS. A LARGE FOLLOW-UP STUDY REPORTED NO EVIDENCE OF AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND CANCER, AND EVEN SHOWED A DECREASED INCIDENCE OF BREAST CANCER COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION. ONE STUDY HAS REPORTED AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF BRAIN CANCER IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS AS COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION. THE INCIDENCE OF BRAIN CANCER, HOWEVER, WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS WHEN COMPARED TO WOMEN WHO HAD OTHER PLASTIC SURGERIES A PUBLISHED REVIEW OF 4 LARGE STUDIES IN WOMEN WITH COSMETIC IMPLANTS AND AN ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP STUDY CONCLUDED THAT THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT SUPPORT AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BRAIN CANCER AND BREAST IMPLANTS. AN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL REVIEW ALSO LENT SUPPORT TO THE LACK OF CAUSATION BETWEEN IMPLANTS AND ANY TYPE OF CANCER. STUDIES HAVE REPORTED AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF RESPIRATORY/LUNG CANCER IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS. OTHER STUDIES OF WOMEN IN SWEDEN AND DENMARK HAVE FOUND THAT WOMEN WHO GET BREAST IMPLANTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE CURRENT SMOKERS THAN WOMEN WHO GET BREAST REDUCTION SURGERY OR OTHER TYPES OF COSMETIC SURGERY. SEVERAL LARGE STUDIES HAVE FOUND NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND RESPIRATORY/LUNG CANCER. TWO STUDIES REPORTED AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF CERVICAL/VULVAR CANCER IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS. ANOTHER LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP STUDY SHOWED EQUIVALENT INCIDENCES OF CERVICAL CANCER IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION. OTHER RECENT LARGE STUDIES CONCLUDED THAT THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT SUPPORT AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM CANCERS AND BREAST IMPLANTS. THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL STUDIES PUBLISHED THAT EXAMINED THE RISK OF OTHER TYPES OF CANCERS, E.G., THYROID CANCERS, URINARY SYSTEM CANCERS, SARCOMA, ENDOCRINE CANCER, CONNECTIVE TISSUE CANCER, CANCER OF THE EYE, AND UNSPECIFIED CANCERS IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS.

20734|145100|D|1||"RPTR WRITES, ""I AM CANCER AND SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT SURVIVOR AND I FEEL MY HISTORY MAY BE OF SOME INTEREST TO YOU. IN 1975 I HAD DOW CORNING BREAST IMPLANTS PLACED IN MY BODY FOR COSMETIC REASONS. I WAS A HEALTHY 33 YEAR OLD WOMAN. AFTER BEING TOLD IMPLANTS WERE PERFECTLY SAFE AND THAT THEY WOULD LAST A LIFE TIME I WILLINGLY SIGNED UP FOR SURGERY. WITHIN THREE MONTHS I DEVELOPED HARD CAPSULES BILATERALLY. MY SURGEON ASSURED ME ALL WAS WELL, HOWEVER HE WOULD NEED TO PERFORM A CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY IN ORDER TO SOFTEN BOTH BREASTS. I RECALL BEING FEARFUL OF THIS PROCEDURE AS A) MY SURGEON MADE ME PROMISE ""NOT TO YELL"" AND B) THERE WOULD BE NO ANESTHESIA. PROCEDURE WAS INDEED VERY PAINFUL AS HE MANUALLY APPLIED PRESSURE TO EACH BREAST AND ""CRACKED"" THEM. I FELT A TEARING SENSATION AROUND EACH BREAST. THIS WAS FIRST OF NINE CLOSED CAPSULOTOMIES, AND I SUSPECT MY LEFT IMPLANT WAS RUPTURED FROM VERY FIRST ONE. ONE YEAR AFTER IMPLANTATION I BEGAN TO HAVE PAIN IN JOINTS OF MY RIGHT HAND AND A STRANGE RASH APPEARED ON MY CHEST AND ARMS. THREE YEARS LATER I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH THYROID CANCER. WHEN I COLLECTED ALL MY MEDICAL RECORDS OVER LAST FEW YEARS I FOUND MY BIOPSY WHICH REFERRED NOT ONLY TO MY MALIGNANT TUMOR, BUT ALSO TO ""YELLOW GELATINOUS MATERIAL"" SURROUNDING MY THYROID GLAND. EVEN THOUGH MY MEDICAL RECORDS CLEARLY STATED I HAD HAD A BREAST AUGMENTATION, NO ONE AT TIME OF SURGERY MENTIONED PRESENCE OF A FOREIGN BODY MATERIAL FOUND IN MY GLAND. MY TUMOR WAS REMOVED YET AN OBVIOUSLY RUPTURED IMPLANT WAS ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN MY BODY FOR SEVERAL MORE YEARS. IT IS KNOWN THAT MOST OF MEDICAL COMMUNITY REFUSES TO ADMIT ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS AND DISEASE; HOWEVER, GIVEN THE PRESENCE OF SILICA THOUGHOUT MY THYROID GLAND AND LYMPH NODES THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND AS TO WHAT CAUSED MY CANCER. SIX YEARS AFTER IMPLANTATION MY RASH CONTINUED TO SPREAD, MY JOINTS ACHED AND MY LEFT BREAST BECAME PAINFUL AND ""HOT"" FEELING. MY LEFT NIPPLE ALSO TURNED A DARKER COLOR THAN OTHER ONE. I FELT FATIGUED, AND DISORIENTATED MOST OF TIME. I CONTINUED TO SEEK MEDICAL CARE AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS NO EXPLANATION FOR MY BODY RASH. MY PHYSICIANS COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR MY SLOW RECOVERY FROM THYROID CANCER AND ALL RELATED TREATMENTS I ENDURED. DUE TO PAIN AND CONTINUED HARDENING OF MY LEFT BREAST MY SURGEON DECIDED TO REPLACE THIS IMPLANT WITH ANOTHER DOW CORNING UNIT. AFTER SURGERY HE DID NOT TELL ME THAT EXPLANTED IMPLANT WAS RUPTURED (I LEARNED ABOUT RUPTURE WHEN COLLECTING ALL MY DATA THREE YEARS AGO). TWELVE YEARS AFTER IMPLANTATION I BEGAN TO HAVE TREMORS IN MY LEFT HAND, CHRONIC GASTRITIS, JOINT ACHE AND A ""PINS AND NEEDLES"" SENSATION IN MY LEGS AND ARMS. AT TIMES I IMAGINED SPIDERS WERE CRAWLING ON MY LEGS. FROM THIS POINT MY HEALTH WENT INTO A DOWNWARD SPIRAL AND I BECAME MORE DEPRESSED AS EACH DOCTOR'S APPT SUGGESTED SAME METHOD OF TREATMENT... SEEK MENTAL THERAPY. BY 1994, AFTER 19 YEARS OF IMPLANTS, MY HEALTH HIT ROCK BOTTOM. I WAS FATIGUED BEYOND POINT OF RECOVERY, NERVOUS, DEPRESSED AND, YES, SUICIDAL. MY BODY WOULD REACT TO SLIGHTEST STIMULANT AND I WAS HAVING SEVERE MEMORY LOSS, AND I BECAME DYSLEXIC. AT ONE POINT I WENT TO OUR LOCAL MARKET, LESS THAN A MILE FROM HOME, AND I COULDN'T REMEMBER HOW TO DRIVE HOME. I BEGAN TO LOSE MY BALANCE AND I HAD DISTORTED VISION. EVEN TODAY ONE OF MY PUPILS DOES NOT DILATE NORMALLY. I RETURNED MANY TIMES TO TRY TO FIND A CURE FOR MY RACING HEARTBEAT, MY RASH, STIFFNESS AND PAIN IN MY LIMBS, TREMOR IN MY HAND, EYE AND VAGINAL DRYNESS. AGAIN I WAS TOLD TO SEEK COUNSELING. OVER THIS PERIOD MY MARRIAGE FAILED AND I BEGAN TO THINK I WAS REALLY CRAZY. I CONSIDERED TAKING MY LIFE MANY TIMES. BY 1994 I WAS FALLING INTO A DEEP HOLE. AFTER A NEAR HEAD ON COLLISION BECAUSE I WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY DISCERNING LEFT FROM RIGHT I BEGAN TO FEAR DRIVING. MY LIFE WAS OUT OF CONTROL. AS A RESULT OF ALL MEDIA COVERAGE AROUND 1994 ON BREAST IMPLANTS I RETURNED TO MY PLASTIC SURGEON. HE TOLD ME THERE COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN MY ""IMAGINED SYMPTOMS"" AND BREAST IMPLANTS. HE DID, HOWEVER, CONCEDE THAT MY IMPLANTS ""LOOKED TERRIBLE"" DUE TO EVER PRESENT CAPSULES. HE RELUCTANTLY AGREED TO REMOVE MY IMPLANTS ON MAY 4, 1994. OF COURSE IT WAS SUGGESTED I REPLACE THEM WITH SALINE IMPLANTS WHICH I DECLINED. ONE MONTH AFTER EXPLANTATION I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BRAIN LESIONS WHICH EXPLAINS MY DIAGNOSES OF ATYPICAL MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. FOR SIX MONTHS MY SYMPTOMS SEEM TO INTENSIFY AND THEN I BEGAN TO SLOWLY IMPROVE. TODAY I LIVE WITH DISCOMFORT AND PAIN OF STIFF LEGS AND SENSATION OF SPIDERS ON MY SKIN IS STILL WITH ME. CLIMATE EXTREMES MAKES PAIN IN MY LEGS UNBEARABLE. MY MEMORY HAS IMPROVED AND I NO LONGER SUFFER, OR CAUSE OTHERS TO SUFFER, THOSE HORRIBLE AND UNPREDICTABLE MOOD SWINGS. MY CANCER IS IN REMISSION AND I AM ON MEDICATION FOR REST OF MY LIFE. MY RASH, IT APPEARS, IS WITH ME FOR LIFE. EVEN THOUGH I'VE HAD SOME IMPROVEMENT MY HEALTH HAS BEEN PERMANENTLY DAMAGED BY BREAST IMPLANTS. WHAT HAS ALL THIS MEANT TO ME? I AM ANGRY TO HAVE LOST 19 YEARS OF MY LIFE TO AVARICE AND DECEPTION OF DOW CORNING. I MOURN LOSS OF MY FIRST MARRIAGE AND I CAN'T HELP WONDERING WHAT LONG TERM HEALTH RISKS ARE FOR ME AND MY FELLOW SURVIVORS. WOULD I HAVE CONSENTED TO BREAST IMPLANTS HAD I BEEN TOLD OF CONSEQUENCES OR GIVEN CONSIDERATION OF READING MANY NEGATIVE TEST RESULTS DOW CORNING HAD AVAILABLE AS EARLY AS 1975? ABSOLUTELY NOT! I WILL DO ALL THAT IS POSSIBLE TO DISCOURAGE YOUNGER WOMEN FROM PURSUING IMPLANTS BE THEY SALINE, SOY, OR WHATEVER ELSE SOME MISGUIDED SCIENTIST DREAMS UP. I STRUGGLE EACH DAY TO COME TO TERMS WITH WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME. THER'S A PART OF ME THAT WANTS TO DENY DECEPTION AND LIES OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. IN OTHER WORDS I STILL WANT TO TRUST AND BELIEVE IN THE GOODNESS OF MAN. THIS I REALIZE IS A FALLACY. I STRONGLY URGE THAT ALL IMPLANTS BE TAKEN OFF MARKET."|GEL-FILLED MAMMARY IMPLANT|973|03/27/1995|V|||Y||20619.0|*|FTR|1.0||BREAST IMPLANT|Y|HH3253|*||MIDLAND|US|DOW CORNING CORP.||MI|48686|0994|*|RIGHT|True

MY BODY WOULD REACT TO SLIGHTEST STIMULANT AND I WAS HAVING SEVERE MEMORY LOSS, AND I BECAME DYSLEXIC. AT ONE POINT I WENT TO OUR LOCAL MARKET, LESS THAN A MILE FROM HOME, AND I COULDN'T REMEMBER HOW TO DRIVE HOME. I BEGAN TO LOSE MY BALANCE AND I HAD DISTORTED VISION. EVEN TODAY ONE OF MY PUPILS DOES NOT DILATE NORMALLY. I RETURNED MANY TIMES TO TRY TO FIND A CURE FOR MY RACING HEARTBEAT, MY RASH, STIFFNESS AND PAIN IN MY LIMBS, TREMOR IN MY HAND, EYE AND VAGINAL DRYNESS. AGAIN I WAS TOLD TO SEEK COUNSELING. OVER THIS PERIOD MY MARRIAGE FAILED AND I BEGAN TO THINK I WAS REALLY CRAZY. I CONSIDERED TAKING MY LIFE MANY TIMES. BY 1994 I WAS FALLING INTO A DEEP HOLE. AFTER A NEAR HEAD ON COLLISION BECAUSE I WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY DISCERNING LEFT FROM RIGHT I BEGAN TO FEAR DRIVING. MY LIFE WAS OUT OF CONTROL. AS A RESULT OF ALL THE MEDIA COVEREAGE AROUND 1994 ON BREAST IMPLANTS I RETURNED TO MY PLASTIC SURGEON. HE TOLD ME THERE COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN MY ""IMAGINED SYMPTOMS"" AND BREAST IMPLANTS. HE DID, HOWEVER, CONCEDE THAT MY IMPLANTS ""LOOKED TERRIBLE"" DUE TO EVER PRESENT CAPSULES. HE RELUCTANTLY AGREED TO REMOVE MY IMPLANTS ON 5/4/94. OF COURSE IT WAS SUGGESTED I REPLACE THEM WITH SALINE IMPLANTS WHICH I DECLINED. ONE MONTH AFTER EXPLANTATION I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BRAIN LESIONS WHICH EXPLAINS MY DIAGNOSES OF ATYPICAL MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. FOR SIX MONTHS MY SYMPTOMS SEEM TO INTENSIFY AND THEN I BEGAN TO SLOWLY IMPROVE. TODAY I LIVE WITH DISCOMFORT AND PAIN OF STIFF LEGS AND SENSATION OF SPIDERS ON MY SKIN IS STILL WITH ME. CLIMATE EXTREMES MAKES PAIN IN MY LEGS UNBEARABLE. MY MEMORY HAS IMPROVED AND I NO LONGER SUFFER, OR CAUSE OTHERS TO SUFFER, THOSE HORRIBLE AND UNPREDICTABLE MOOD SWINGS. MY CANCER IS IN REMISSION AND I AM ON MEDICATION FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. MY RASH, IT APPEARS, IS WITH ME FOR LIFE. EVEN THOUGH I'VE HAD SOME IMPROVEMENT MY HEALTH HAS BEEN PERMANENTLY DAMAGED BY BREAST IMPLANTS. WHAT HAS ALL THIS MEANT TO ME? I AM ANGRY TO HAVE LOST 19 YEARS OF MY LIFE TO THE AVARICE AND DECEPTION OF DOW CORNING. I MOURN THE LOSS OF MY FIRST MARRIAGE AND I CAN'T HELP WONDERING WHAT THE LONG TERM HEALTH RISKS ARE FOR ME AND MY FELLOW SURVIVORS. WOULD I HAVE CONSENTED TO BREAST IMPLANTS HAD I BEEN TOLD OF THE CONSEQUENCES OR GIVEN CONSIDERATION OF READING MANY NEGATIVE TEST RESULTS DOW CORNING HAD AVAILABLE AS EARLY AS 1975? ABSOLUTELY NOT! I WILL DO ALL THAT IS POSSIBLE TO DISCOURAGE YOUNGER WOMEN FROM PURSUING IMPLANTS BE THEY SALINE, SOY, OR WHATEVER ELSE SOME MISGUIDED SCIENTIST DREAMS UP. I STRUGGLE EACH DAY TO COME TO TERMS WITH WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME. THERE'S A PART OF ME THAT WANTS TO DENY THE DECEPTION AND LIES OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. IN OTHER WORDS I STILL WANT TO TRUST AND BELIEVE IN GOODNESS OF MAN. THIS I REALIZE IS A FALLACY. I STRONGLY URGE THAT ALL IMPLANTS BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET..."""|GEL-FILLED MAMMARY IMPLANT|350-7200|03/27/1995|Y|||Y||20620.0|*|FTR|1.0||BREAST IMPLANT|Y|229038|*||MIDLAND|US|DOW CORNING CORP.||MI|48686|0994|*|LEFT|True

IN 1970, RPTR WAS INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT WHICH RESULTED IN COSMETIC BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY. AT THE TIME HER PLASTIC SURGEON REASSURED HER THAT IMPLANTS WERE VERY SAFE. THE FIRST SEVERAL YEARS SHE HAD NO ADVERSE EFFECTS. BEFORE SURGERY SHE WAS AN ACTIVE HEALTHY MOTHER AND HOMEMAKER WHO HIKED, BIKED, RAISED TWO CHILDREN, MANAGED A HOME AND WAS VERY ACTIVE IN CHARITY WORK. IN 1980 SHE BEGAN HER SECOND CAREER. SHE ALSO STARTED TO EXPERIENCE SYMPTOMS. DESPITE MANY TESTS HER PHYSICIAN COULD NOT DIAGNOSE PROBLEMS. SHE HAD CHRONIC STOMACH PROBLEMS, COLON AND ABDOMINAL PAIN, FREQUENT HEADACHES, WHICH PROGRESSED TO OTHER BODY PAINS; CHRONIC NECK AND SHOULDER PAIN, ARM AND HAND PAIN, WHICH WAS AGAIN UNEXPLAINED. IN 1981 SHE HAD A RASH ON HER ENTIRE BODY WHICH NEVER WENT AWAY AND NOW ARE BROWN SPOTS ALL OVER HER TORSO, AND LESS ON THE EXTREMITIES. PROGRESSIVELY HER HEALTH BECAME WORSE AS SHE CONTINUED WORKING. BY 1986-87, SHE FOUND HERSELF SUFFERING MORE SEVERELY WITH CHRONIC FATIGUE AND BY 1990 SHE HAD TO RESIGN FROM A POSITION WHICH AFFECTED HER FAMILY SINCE SHE WAS A MAJOR FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTOR. SINCE THAT TIME SHE HAD NEEDED TO WORK PART TIME BECAUSE SHE IS INCAPABLE OF WORKING MORE THAN 3-4 HOUR A DAY AND ONLY 3-4 DAYS A WEEK. THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS SHE HAS GONE TO SEVERAL PHYSICIANS WHO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DIAGNOSE HER CONDITION. CURRENTLY SHE IS BEING TREATED FOR THE FOLLOWING, WITH LITTLE TO NO RELIEF: 1) LUPUS 2) RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS 3) MAJOR DEPRESSION 4) RAYNAUD'S 5) CHRONIC EYE PROBLEMS/OCULAR HYPERTENSION 6) CHRONIC FATIGUE 7) IMMUNE DEFICIENCY 8) FIBROMYALGIA. SHE HAS NO ENERGY, SHE LIVES WITH CONSTANT PAIN, HER DIAGNOSIS OF LUPUS FROM A SPECIALIST. SWOLLEN JOINTS, NECK, ARMS AND HAND PAIN ARE EVEN MORE THAN ARTHRITIS. SHE FEELS DISABLED NOW.

SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDED INFECTION, RUPTURE, CHRONIC PAIN AND FATIGUE, CHRONIC INFLAMMATION, SPEECH AND VISION PROBLEMS, DISCHARGE FROM NIPPLE, HUMAN ADJUVANT DISEASE, FIBROMYALGIA. ACCORDING TO A MEDICAL AND NEUROLOGIC EVALUATION 1/30/95: PT REPORTS BEING IN HER USUAL EXCELLENT STATE OF MEDICAL, NEUROLOGIC, AND PSYCHIATRIC HEALTH WHEN SHE CONSULTED THE DR FOR COSMETIC AUGMENTATION MAMMOPLASTY WITH INSERTION OF BILATERAL SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS. SHE DEVELOPED SOME IMMEDIATE DECREASED SENSATION IN THE NIPPLES, WHICH WITH TIME CHANGED TO A MILD HYPERSENSITIVITY. OTHERWISE, THERE WERE NO IMMEDIATE COMPLICATIONS FROM THIS SURGERY. HOWEVER, ONE WEEK LATER, PT WAS INVOLVED IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT. SHE IMMEDIATELY DEVELOPED BURNING PAIN IN HER BREASTS, AND IMPLANTS WERE KNOCKED INTO NEW POSITIONS, WITH ONE OBVIOUSLY AT A DIFFERENT LEVEL THAN THE OTHER. NO IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION WAS ATTEMPTED, WITH THE HOPE THAT WITH TIME IMPLANTS WOULD RELOCATE TO A BETTER POSITION ON THEIR OWN. HOWEVER, INSTEAD, BOTH IMPLANTS HARDENED MARKEDLY, ESPECIALLY ON THE RIGHT, AND DID NOT IMPROVE IN PLACEMENT. DUE TO THE UNACCEPTABLE HARDENING AND PLACEMENT, PT WAS REOPERATED IN 1975, WITH FINDINGS OF BILATERAL IMPLANT RUPTURE. NEW IMPLANTS WERE PLACED AT THAT TIME. SHORTLY THEREAFTER, BOTH IMPLANTS HARDENED, ESPECIALLY ON THE RIGHT, AND SEVERAL CLOSED CAPSULOTOMIES WERE PERFORMED, WHICH EVENTUALLY SOFTENED THE LEFT IMPLANT, BUT COULD NOT EFFECTIVELY SOFTEN THE RIGHT ONE. IN 1978, THE RIGHT IMPLANT AND EXTENSIVE SCAR TISSUE WERE REMOVED AND A NEW IMPLANT PLACED ON THE RIGHT. THIS IMPLANT AGAIN MARKEDLY HARDENED AND WAS REPLACED AGAIN IN 1979, 1982, AND 1982, WITH SEVERE RE-HARDENING AND PAIN EACH TIME. STINGING AND BURNING PAINS IN THE CHEST AND BREAST AREAS PERSISTED. BETWEEN 1985 AND 1990, THERE WAS AGAIN SEVERE RE-HARDENING ON THE RIGHT ""LIKE A ROCK."" IN 1990, PT HAD BOTH IMPLANTS REMOVED AND NEW IMPLANTS PLACED.

THE IMPLANTS WERE REPLACED ONCE BILATERALLY, AND RPTR CLAIMS SHE HAS HAD ONE BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY, BEGINNING WITH THE FIRST IMPLANT SURGERY. SHE CURRENTLY DOES NOT HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. RPTR CLAIMS THAT BILATERALLY THE IMPLANTS: RUPTURED, HAD BLEEDING THROUGH THE ENVELOPE, AND WERE ASSOCIATED WITH A SURGICAL AREA INFECTION. RPTR HAD ONE CLOSE CAPSULOTOMY AS TREATMENT FOR ONE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE.

MD REPORT STATES: THE RIGHT SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT APPEARS TO HAVE MAINTAINED ITS STRUCTURAL SHAPE AND ELASTOMER INTEGRITY. UPON CLOSE EXAMINATION THE ELASTOMER SURFACE APPEARS DRY AND DEVOID OF ANY LUSTROUS APPEARANCE. THE SILICONE GEL WAS TRANSPARENT AND COLORLESS, BUT CONTAINED SOME PRECIPITATED PARTICLES. THE NATURE OF THE PRECIPITATED PARTICLES NOTED ABOVE WAS NOT POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED BECAUSE TO DO SO WOULD HAVE REQUIRED DAMAGING THE ELASTOMER MEMBRANE AND RUINING THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE PROSTHETIC DEVICE. NEVERTHELESS, THE PRECIPITATED PARTICLES APPEAR SIMILAR TO AGGREGATES STUDIES IN OTHER RUPTURED DEVICES. MICROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF THESE PARTICLES REVEALS THAT THEY ARE COTTON-LIKE PARACRYSTALLINE FORMATIONS. THESE FORMATIONS WERE FOUND TO BE CHEMICAL RATHER THAN BIOLOGICAL IN ORIGIN. THE LEFT SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT, UNLIKE ITS COUNTERPART, WAS RUPTURED AND SILICONE GEL WAS EXTERNALIZED. THE SILICONE GEL WAS TRANSPARENT, COLORLESS, AND DID NOT CONTAIN ANY AGGREGATED PARTICLES. THE PATHOLOGY SECTION OF THIS REPORT REVEALS THAT CELLULAR REACTIVE CHANGES OCCURRED RESULTING IN THE FORMATION OF A FIBROCONNECTIVE TISSUE CAPSULE. THIS CAPSULE DISPLAYS SIGNS OF CHRONIC INFLAMMATION. IT CONTAINS FOREIGN BODIES IN TISSUE CELLS AND FIBERS. THE SEARCH REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF SILICONE PARTICLES INFILTRATING THE BREAST CAPSULE TISSUE. THE PARTICLES WERE OBSERVED COATING THE WALLS OF THE EXTRACELLULAR SPACES BETWEEN THE TISSUE FIBERS AND CELL PARENCHYMA. THE ENLARGED PRINTS ILLUSTRATE THE SILICONE PARTICLES IN A BRIGHT OFF-WHITE COLOR THAT STANDS OUT AGAINST THE TISSUE AND BACKGROUND WHICH ARE PURPLE AND BLUE, RESPECTIVELY. THE PRESENCE AND LOCATION OF THE SILICONE GEL PARTICLES IN THESE TISSUES INDICATE THAT THEY HAD MIGRATED FROM A RUPTURED AND/OR BLEEDING IMPLANT. THE BREAST TISSUE REACTED TO THEIR PRESENCE BY FRAGMENTING THE EXTRUDED SILICONE GEL INTO MICROSCOPIC PARTICLES AND ENCAPSULATING THEM WITHIN FIBROUS TISSUE. THESE PROCESSES OCCURRED OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME AND DID NOT RESULT FROM ANY SILICONE LEAKAGE/RUPTURE THAT MAY HAVE OCCURRED DURING SURGERY FOR THEIR REMOVAL. GROSS DESCRIPTION: LABELED AS ""RIGHT BREAST IMPLANT"", THIS SPECIMEN CAME IN A PLASTIC CONTAINER INTACT. THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF BLEEDING OR RUPTURE. THE SILICONE GEL IS COLORLESS BUT SOME PRECIPITATE IS NOTICED INSIDE THE GEL. THE IMPLANT CONTAINS 225CC OF FLUID. THE IMPLANT WEIGHS 228.7 GRAMS AND MEASURES 12CM IN DIAMETER. LABELED AS ""LEFT BREAST IMPLANT"", THIS SPECIMEN CAME IN A PLASTIC CONTAINER RUPTURED. THE RUPTURE POINT IS 2CM IN LENGTH AND SILICONE GEL CAN BE SEEN PROTRUDING THROUGH THE ORIFICE. THE GEL IS CLEAR AND NO PRECIPITATE IS NOTICED. THE IMPLANT MEASURES 12.5CM IN DIAMETER AND WEIGHS 226.2 GRAMS. OPERATIVE REPORT: THIS IS A 52 YEAR OLD WHITE FEMALE WHO REQUESTED REMOVAL OF HER BILATERAL BREAST PROSTHESES. THIS PT UNDERWENT SILICONE BREAST AUGMENTATION IN 6/86 AND NOW RELATES A HISTORY OF JOINT PAINS AND RINGING IN HER EARS SINCE 3/92. AT THE TIME OF INITIAL CONSULTATION THE POSSIBILITY OF REPLACING THE IMPLANTS WITH SALINE FILLED PROSTHESES WAS DISCUSSED AND HER HUSBAND APPEARED TO FAVOR THIS. HOWEVER, THE PT WAS ADAMANT THAT SHE WANTED NO IMPLANTS AT ALL AND THEREFORE IT WAS MENTIONED THAT HER BREASTS WOULD BE SOMEWHAT PTOTIC AFTER THE SURGERY. SURGICAL PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION REPORT: THE SPECIMEN IS RECEIVED IN THE FRESH STATE, LABELLED WITH THE PT'S NAME AND ACCESSION NUMBER AS ""SALIVARY GLAND BIOPSY"", AND CONSISTS OF ONE IRREGULAR PIECE OF PINK, TAN, AND RED SOFT TISSUE MEASURING 0.8X 0.7X 0.4CM.

THE FIRST TIME WAS BECAUSE FROM WHAT THE DR SAID IT APPEARED TO BE HAVING WHAT HE CALLED ""A SLOW LEAK"" WHICH LATER TURNED OUT TO BE WRONG, HE JUST PUT THE WRONG SIZE IN. THEN THE SECOND TIME WAS TO CORRECT THE CAPSULE AND SIZE DIFFERENCE. CAPSULED AFTER THEY WERE REPLACED AGAIN WHICH THE DR APPARENTLY CORRECTED WITH MASSAGES.

827167|18106831|D|1||THIS COMPLAINT DETAILS THE MEDICAL FRAUD AND ABUSE THAT I EXPERIENCED THROUGH BUSINESS DONE WITH INAMED AESTHETICS. I AM SENDING YOU THIS NOTICE IN ORDER TO INCREASE YOUR AWARENESS OF THEIR FRADULENT CONDUCT AND MAKE YOU AWARE OF THESE PRESSING MEDICAL CONCERNS. I RECENTLY PURCHASED SALINE FILLED BILATERAL BREAST IMPLANTS AND A MOLECULAR ENZYME TRANSFER TYPE REJUVENATION SUIT TO CONTOUR FACE AND BODY FROM INAMED AESTHETICS. FOLLOWING MY PURCHASE, I EXPERIENCED DIZZINESS, NAUSEA, FAINTING AND OTHER MEDICAL SYMPTOMS ACCOMPANIED BY DEFORMITIES IN THE APPEARANCE OF MY FACE, BODY AND BREASTS. I HAVE CONTACTED THE CO SEVERAL TIMES, BUT THERE HAS BEEN NO SUITABLE RESPONSE OR RESOLUTION TO MY CLAIM AGAINST THEM. THEY HAVE NOT OFFERED SETTLEMENT IN A PRODUCT DEFECT LAWSUIT, THEY HAVE NOT OFFERED EXPLORATORY SURGERY OPTIONS AND THEY HAVE NOT OFFERED TO FURNISH ME WITH A NEW MORE AESTHETICALLY APPEALING SURGERY TO REPLACE THE OLD ONE. NONE OF THEIR SOLUTIONS ARE SATISFACTORY AND ALL OF THEIR SOLUTIONS REVOLVE AROUND PUSHING ME ASIDE AND TELLING ME 'WE ARE SO SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE.' I AM VERY SERIOUS IN THE EFFORT OF FILING THIS COMPLAINT AND I EXPECT FOR THIS CO TO OFFER ME AN EQUITABLE SOLUTION. I WOULD ALSO LIKE FOR YOUR BUSINESS TO ENTER MY COMPLAINT IN YOUR RECORDS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THIS IS A CO THAT YOU REFER CLIENTS TO OFTEN. IN MY OPINION, INAMED AESTHETICS IS NOT A REPUTABLE CO WITH HIGH STANDARDS OF EXCELLENCE AND SHOULD NOT BE REGARDED AS SUCH BY THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF PLASTIC SURGEONS OR THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR AESTHETIC PLASTIC SURGERY. I INITIALLY PURCHASED THE SALINE IMPLANTS AT THE SURGERY CENTER AND THE REJUVENATION SUIT AT THE INAMED OFFICES. AT ONE POINT, THEY EVEN DENIED THAT THEY COMPLETED THE PROCEDURE WHILE THE PICTURE OF MY FACE WAS CLEARLY POSTED ON THE WALL OF THEIR OFFICE DEMONSTRATING THE SUCCESS OF THEIR FIRST PROCEDURE. IN FACT, THIS PICTURE IS OFTEN COMMENTED ON BY OUTSIDE OBSERVERS AS IT IS POSTED DIRECTLY ABOVE THE HALL CORRIDOR TO THEIR OFFICES. I AM SENDING THIS LETTER OF COMPLAINT TO THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL BECAUSE I DO NOT KNOW WHAT MORE I CAN DO TO WORK THINGS OUT ON MY OWN ACCORD WITH THE PEOPLE FROM INAMED/ALLERGAN, A COSMETIC SURGERY CO, AND THEIR SUSIDIARY MACKENZIE PARTNERS. I BELIEVE THAT THIS BUSINESS IS NOT LEGITIMATE AND SHOULD BE REGULATED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE THAT THEY PROVIDE THE SERVICES THAT THEY ADVERTISE AND AT LEAST ATTEMPT TO RECTIFY ANY HARMFUL EFFECTS. THEY HAD MY PICTURE POSTED ON THE WALL. I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE FOR THEM TO ALTER MAY APPEARANCE BACK TO MY OWN LIKENESS TODAY AND I DO NOT FEEL THAT THEY HAVE PROVIDED AN AESTHETICALLY PLEASING SURGICAL PRODUCT TO ENHANCE MY FACE. I WOULD LIKE MY BODY AND BREASTS RECONTOURED TO BE MORE AESTHETICALLY PLEASING INCLUDING APPLYING LARGER IMPLANTATIONS IN THE BREASTS. I HAVE CONTACTED THIS CO SEVERAL TIMES TO ANSWER TO MY COMPLAINTS. MY FLUSH LINE HAS NOT BEEN CLEARED, MY MEZMERIZER HAS NOT BEEN REASSIGNED AND I AM RECEIVING SO MUCH INTERFERENCE ON MY MOLECULAR TRANSFER LINE THAT I HAVE GAINED WEIGHT AND IT HAS ADDED AN UGLY APPEARANCE TO MAY FACE. I WOULD LIKE FOR THE CO TO REPLACE MY SUIT WITH THE ONE OF MY OWN LIKENESS. THESE PEOPLE DO NOT ALLOW INSURANCE COVERAGE SO THAT THE INSURANCE PROVIDER CAN NOT BE USED TO REGULATE THEIR CONDUCT.

IT TOOK ME BEGGING THE HOSPITAL TO GIVE ME THE MRI'S -COMMONLY CONSIDERED A ""COSMETIC PROCEDURE""- TO SHOW THAT BOTH IMPLANTS HAD RUPTURED. THE FOLLOWING MONTH, I HAD SURGERY TO REMOVE THE LEAKING SILICONE IMPLANTS WHICH BY THIS TIME HAD BECOME EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURES - SILICONE HAD TRAVELED THROUGHOUT MY BODY. I HAD AN ""EXCHANGE"" SURGERY PERFORMED, NEW SILICONE IMPLANTS PUT IN DURING THIS OPERATION. SURGEON MADE A MISTAKE - PUT WRONG SIZE SILICONE IMPLANT INTO WRONG BREAST. WAITED 1 YEAR AND HAD ""REVISION"" SURGERY IN 2008. THE SURGEON SWITCHED THE 1-YEAR-OLD IMPLANTS - DID NOT ORDER AND USE NEW IMPLANTS.

LET ME MAKE THIS CLEAR: SONOGRAM 2007 SHOWED BOTH IMPLANTS INTACT AND FINE. WRONG! I FELT VERY ILL, HAD NO ENERGY, WAS EXPERIENCING RAPID WEIGHT LOSS AND KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG. IT TOOK ME BEGGING THE HOSPITAL TO GIVE ME THE MRI'S -COMMONLY CONSIDERED A ""COSMETIC PROCEDURE""- TO SHOW THAT BOTH IMPLANTS HAD RUPTURED. THE FOLLOWING MONTH, I HAD SURGERY TO REMOVE THE LEAKING SILICONE IMPLANTS WHICH BY THIS TIME HAD BECOME EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURES - SILICONE HAD TRAVELED THROUGHOUT MY BODY. I HAD AN ""EXCHANGE"" SURGERY PERFORMED, NEW SILICONE IMPLANTS PUT IN DURING THIS OPERATION. SURGEON MADE A MISTAKE - PUT WRONG SIZE SILICONE IMPLANT INTO WRONG BREAST. WAITED 1 YEAR AND HAD ""REVISION"" SURGERY IN 2008. THE SURGEON SWITCHED THE 1-YEAR-OLD IMPLANTS - DID NOT ORDER AND USE NEW IMPLANTS. BY THE WAY, THIS SURGEON IS THE SAME SURGEON WHO PERFORMED THE PROCEDURE IN 1977. MORE PROBLEMS - AFTER ASPIRATING THE LEFT BREAST DUE TO A HEMATOMA, A ""HOLE"" DEVELOPED AT THE ASPIRATION SITE LEAVING THE LEFT IMPLANT EXPOSED. I ""GAVE UP"" DUE TO THE ONGOING TRAUMA AND IN A WISH FOR THE HEALTHIEST OUTCOME POSSIBLE, DECIDED TO HAVE BOTH ""NEW/1-YEAR-OLD"" IMPLANTS REMOVED. THE EXPLANT PROCEDURE WAS CONDUCTED IN EARLY 2009 BY A DIFFERENT SURGEON. I AM NOW VERY DISFIGURED WITH SCARRED/BURNED OFF RIGHT AREOLA WITH OPEN WOUND ON RIGHT AREOLA THAT HAS NOT HEALED SINCE LATE 2007 SURGERY; MAJOR SCARRING ON BOTH BREASTS; SMALLER, TUBULAR, NIPPLE OUT OF ALIGNMENT OF LEFT BREAST. BOTTOM LINE, I WANT YOU TO BE AWARE OF: I HAVE HAD SEVERE PAIN-RELATED DISABILITIES/PROBLEMS, WEIGHT LOSS, BRAIN MEMORY ISSUES, NUMBNESS IN HANDS/FEET, ETC. SINCE THE FALL OF 2007. I WAS GIVEN A SURVEY TO COMPLETE FROM MENTOR THAT IS PART OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY IN ORDER TO KEEP FDA APPROVAL, BUT I COULD NOT COMPLETE IT THEREFORE DID NOT SUBMIT IT, BECAUSE IT WAS RELEVANT ONLY FOR 1ST TIME PATIENTS. IT HAS NOT BEEN DESIGNED FOR ""MY COHORT"" OF WHICH THEY ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE WOMEN WHO HAVE HAD IMPLANTS FOR A LONG TIME THAT NOW NEED TO BE REMOVED OR REPLACED."|MENTOR||01/10/2009||||Y|||0HP|FTR|2.0||SILICONE IMPLANTS||5753349|||||MENTOR|||||3754BC||True

1783239|1568093|D|1||SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLANTS - HAD THIS SURGERY AROUND 1980 OR 1981. I AM (B)(6) NOW, I WAS (B)(6) AT THE TIME OF SURGERY. TEN YEARS AFTER THE FACT, I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BENIGN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS - NO ONE ELSE IN ENTIRE FAMILY, EITHER SIDE, HAD THIS DISEASE. I WAS BEING TOLD BY ALL DOCTORS, THE IMPLANTS WERE NOT THE PROBLEM. I EVEN WENT TO A WOMAN PLASTIC SURGEON WHO DID NOTHING, NOT EVEN CHECK WITH MRI FOR PROBLEMS WITH THE IMPLANTS. I WAS NOT EVER INFORMED THAT IS THE WAY TO FIND PROBLEMS NOW - THIS YEAR - 2 YEARS AGO, I BECAME SO SICK AND COULD NOT WALK OR USE MY HANDS FROM THE ELBOW DOWN; THE INTENSE NUMBNESS, BURNING, TINGLING, HEAVY HOT SENSATION NON-STOP 24 HOURS A DAY. I CONTACTED MY MS DOCTORS, STEROIDS DIDN'T EVEN HELP. I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SO I WENT TO AN ALTERNATIVE DOCTOR. SHE IS AN ALLERGY, ENVIRONMENTAL DOCTOR AND HAS AN MD AS THE FIRST INITIALS BESIDES OTHERS AFTER HER NAME VERY WELL KNOWN EVEN WITH MY (B)(6) INS. I HAD A 2 HOUR CONSULTATION WITH HER AND SHE WENT THROUGH MY WHOLE MEDICAL HISTORY AND SAID GET THE IMPLANTS OUT; YOU WERE HEALTHY UP TILL YOU HAD THEM. NO ONE EVER SAID THEY DO NOT LAST IN FACT, I WAS LED TO BELIEVE THEY LAST FOREVER, WHAT A JOKE, THESE ALMOST KILLED ME. I HAVE A 20 YEAR HISTORY OF NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS WITH THIS DISEASE THAT NO DOCTORS WANT TO ADMIT TO. WELL I HAD THE IMPLANTS REMOVED (B)(6) 2010 AND I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DETOX. MY ALTERNATIVE DOCTOR DID TOXIC TESTS, I HAVE VERY ELEVATED LEVELS OF MERCURY, LEAD, CADIUM, BARIUM GADOLINIUM THEY ARE OFF THE CHARTS FOR TOXICITY. I AM GETTING A LITTLE BETTER, I CAN AT LEAST GET TO SLEEP AT NIGHT WHERE AS BEFORE, I COULD NOT BECAUSE OF THE DISCOMFORT AND PAIN. WITH CHELATION, THE HANDS ARE COMING BACK BUT ITS TOO EARLY TO KNOW THE FULL OUT-COME. I CAN STILL FEEL A COOL TINGLING RUNNING DOWN MY ARMS AND BACK OF NECK SAME AS THE FEELING I FELT IN BOTH BREASTS. I DID HAVE A MS NURSE SAY THAT SILICONE IMPLANTS CAN CAUSE AUTO-IMMUNE BUT BASICALLY MY CONVENTIONAL DOCTORS DON'T WANT TO STEP ON ANY FEET, THEY ALL KNOW EACH OTHER. I AM DISABLED AND HAVE BEEN SINCE 10 YEARS AFTER THE IMPLANTS WERE PUT IN. I LIVE ON DISABILITY MONEY WHICH IS VERY HARD TO DO, I CAN PROVE THE TOXIC TESTS AND THE PATHOLOGY REPORTS OF PLASTER YELLOW BROWN SUBSTANCE CALCIFIED MATERIAL THEY FOUND IN MY BREASTS. ALSO, THE PLASTIC SURGEON CALLED ME THE MORNING AFTER THE SURGERY TO TELL ME HE FOUND NOTHING FELT AND COULD ONLY REMOVE THE CAPSULES - THAT'S NICE - BUT YET, THEY CODED MY SURGERY AS COSMETIC AND MY INS.

BREAST IMPLANT RUPTURE IS CONSIDERED Â¿SYMPTOMATICÂ¿ WHEN IT IS ACCOMPANIED BY CHANGES IN THE LOOK OR FEEL OF THE BREAST AND/OR BREAST IMPLANT. ADVISE YOUR PATIENT THAT SHE WILL NEED TO HAVE REGULAR MRIS TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE EVEN IF SHE IS HAVING NO PROBLEMS. MRI SCREENINGS SHOULD BE PERFORMED AT 3 YEARS POSTOPERATIVELY, THEN EVERY 2 YEARS THEREAFTER. IF RUPTURE IS NOTED VIA MRI, THEN YOU SHOULD ADVISE YOUR PATIENT TO HAVE HER IMPLANT REMOVED. BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. BREAST IMPLANTS RUPTURE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. RUPTURES CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO RUPTURE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, STRESSING THE IMPLANT DURING IMPLANTATION AND WEAKENING IT, FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL, EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED), TRAUMA, COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING, AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF RUPTURE FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT. IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF RUPTURE. LABORATORY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RUPTURE ARE ONGOING. SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE. IF RUPTURE OCCURS, SILICONE GEL MAY EITHER REMAIN WITHIN THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), MOVE OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE (EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), OR MOVE OUTSIDE THE BREAST (GEL MIGRATION). THERE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY THAT RUPTURE MAY PROGRESS FROM INTRACAPSULAR TO EXTRACAPSULAR AND BEYOND. PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY TO THEIR BREAST AND/OR IMPLANT WILL LIKELY BE NECESSARY OVER THE COURSE OF THEIR LIVES. ADDITIONAL SURGERIES TO THE PATIENTSÂ¿ BREASTS WILL LIKELY BE REQUIRED, EITHER BECAUSE OF IMPLANT RUPTURE, OTHER COMPLICATIONS, OR UNACCEPTABLE COSMETIC OUTCOMES. EXPLANTED DEVICES SHOULD BE INTRAOPERATIVELY ASSESSED BY THE EXPLANTING SURGEON TO IDENTIFY THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF IMPLANT RUPTURE AND GEL MIGRATION AND RETURNED TO ALLERGAN FOR EVALUATION. RUPTURED BREAST IMPLANTS MUST BE REPORTED AND SHOULD BE RETURNED TO ALLERGAN.|STYLE 15 SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|15-304|05/01/2015||05/09/2016|DA|R|Y||0HP|FTR|1.0|04/12/2013|PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||1597907|||LA AURORA DE HEREDIA|CS|ALLERGAN|||||||True

ALL ALONG THESE MANY YEARS OF DEALING WITH SYMPTOMS UNK AS TO WHY THEY WERE OCCURRING, THEN BEING THOUGHT TO HAVE FIBROMYALGIA, DIVINE INTERVENTION LED ME TO DIG DEEPER INTO MY EXISTING CONDITION, AS I COULD NOT AND WOULD NOT ACCEPT THIS HEALTH DETERIORATION AS WHAT I WILL FACE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. TO PREFACE THIS PAT ABOUT MY FINDINGS AND WHAT FOLLOWED, I'LL BRIEFLY EXPLAIN HOW THIS CAME ABOUT. HERE AND THERE THROUGHOUT THESE MANY YEARS, I SPECULATED THAT THE CULPRIT BEHIND MY HEALTH PROBLEMS COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN STEMMING FROM MY BREAST IMPLANTS, BUT AFTER CONSULTING THE COSMETIC SURGEON WHO PERFORMED BY BREAST AUGMENTATION, AND OTHER VARIOUS PHYSICIANS, I WAS CONVINCED BY THESE PRACTITIONERS THAT MY BREAST IMPLANTS WERE MOST DEFINITELY NOT THE CAUSE OF MY HEALTH ISSUES. NATURALLY, IT IS ANYONE'S INCLINATION TO TRUST WHAT DOCTORS TELL US, AND THEREFORE I DID JUST THAT. NOT BEING ABLE TO LET GO OF THE PRESSING THOUGHT THAT MY BREAST IMPLANTS JUST MIGHT BE THE ROOT TO ALL OF MY SUFFERING, I BEGAN PUTTING ALL OF MY EXPENDABLE ENERGY INTO RIGOROUS RESEARCH REGARDING BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESSES. IT DID NOT TAKE ME VERY LONG TO CONCLUDE THAT MY SUSPICIONS OF MY BREAST IMPLANTS WERE INDEED THE ROOT CAUSE OF ALL OF MY MANY YEARS OF PAIN AND SUFFERING. I QUICKLY LEARNED ABOUT A DOCTOR OUT OF (B)(6) WHO SPECIALIZES AND ADVOCATES IN BREAST IMPLANT DISEASES AND BREAST IMPLANT REMOVALS. I THEN STARTED A REGULAR CORRESPONDENCE WITH THIS DOCTOR AND SET AN APPOINTMENT TO HAVE MY IMPLANTS REMOVED. PRIOR TO MY REMOVAL SURGERY, MY BLOOD LABORATORY RESULTS SHOWED THE PRESENCE OF MYCOPLASMA PNEUMONIA. THIS ALARMED ME AS I LEARNED THE NATURE OF THIS HARMFUL MICROORGANISM THAT INVADED BY BODY AS A RESULT OF TAINTED IMPLANTS AND A SUPPRESSED IMMUNITY. IT TURNS OUT THAT FOR YEARS, MY BODY WAS FIGHTING A SILENT BATTLE THAT EVENTUALLY BEGAN SHOWING ITS FACE WITH THE ONSET OF MY INITIAL SYMPTOMS YEARS EARLIER. ALL OF THE YEARS THAT WENT BY WITH LITTLE TO NO ANSWERS OR REPUTABLE TREATMENTS, THE MYCOPLASMA WAS WREAKING HAVOC WITHIN MY BODY AND TERRIBLY STRESSING MY IMMUNE SYSTEM. WHEN MY BREAST IMPLANT REMOVAL SURGERY DAY CAME ABOUT, MY SURGEON WAS NOT SURPRISED TO SEE THAT MY BREAST TISSUES SURROUNDING THE IMPLANTS WERE BADLY INFECTED AND GROWING MOLD AND FUNGUS. FIVE INFECTED LYMPH NODES WERE REMOVED THAT WERE LOCATED NEAR THE BREAST, ALONG WITH THE INFECTED TISSUES, AND OF COURSE THE IMPLANTS THEMSELVES. MY SURGEON WHO PERFORMED THE REMOVAL, ALSO EXPLAINED THAT THE MYCOPLASMA PNEUMONIA WAS RESIDING WITHIN ANY AND ALL REGIONS OF BY BODY INCLUDING MAJOR INTERNAL ORGANS.|SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS||11/09/2015||||*|*||0LP|FWM|1.0||SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS||475 CC|||||MENTOR|||||5530938||True

4672656|13207851|N|1||(B)(4). THE EVENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA WAS INITIALLY REPORTED VIA EASR ON (B)(6), 2010, WITH THE ADVERSE EVENT TERM CODE OF CANCER. AN UPDATE TO OUR SAFETY DATABASE FOR THIS REPORTED EVENT NOTES THAT THE TERM CODE HAS BEEN CHANGED FROM CANCER TO LYMPHOMA-ALCL DUE TO INCREASED SPECIFICITY. SEROMA WAS REPORTED AT THAT TIME ALSO. DEVICE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. CALCIUM DEPOSITS CAN FORM IN THE TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT WITH SYMPTOMS THAT MAY INCLUDE PAIN AND FIRMNESS. LYMPHADENOPATHY HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED IN SOME WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS. BASED ON INFO REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGAN'S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERS' BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MUFTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. USE CARE IN SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURES SUCH AS OPEN CAPSULOTOMY, BREAST POCKET REVISION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA ASPIRATION, AND BIOPSY/LUMPECTOMY TO AVOID DAMAGE TO THE IMPLANT SHELL OR VALVE. ANY POSTOPERATIVE EVACUATION OF HEMATOMA OR SEROMA MUST BE CONDUCTED WITH CARE TO AVOID BREAST IMPLANT CONTAMINATION, OR DAMAGE FROM SHARP INSTRUMENTS. THE USE OF MICROWAVE DIATHERMY IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST IMPLANTS IS NOT RECOMMENDED, AS IT HAS BEEN REPORTED TO CAUSE TISSUE NECROSIS, SKIN EROSION, AND EXTRUSION OF THE IMPLANT. ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE IN VIVO EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. PATIENTS SHOULD BE INFORMED THAT DISSATISFACTION WITH COSMETIC RESULTS RELATED TO SUCH THINGS AS SCAR DEFORMITY, HYPERTROPHIC SCARRING, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, INCORRECT SIZE, AND IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY MAY OCCUR. CAREFUL SURGICAL PLANNING AND TECHNIQUE CAN MINIMIZE, BUT NOT PRECLUDE, THE RISK OF SUCH RESULTS. PRE-EXISTING ASYMMETRY MAY NOT BE ENTIRELY CORRECTABLE. REVISION SURGERY MAY BE INDICATED TO MAINTAIN PATIENT SATISFACTION BUT CARRIES ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS AND RISKS.

5649766|45202175|D|1||"I HAD BREAST IMPLANTS PUT IN BEHIND THE MUSCLE ON (B)(6) 2012. SHORTLY AFTER THE SURGERY, I BECAME ILL STARTING WITH FATIGUE AND HAIR LOSS. EACH YEAR SINCE, I HAVE HAD AN INCREASING AMOUNT OF SYMPTOMS BEGIN AND BASICALLY EACH ORGAN WITHIN MY BODY FELT AS THOUGH IT WAS FAILING AS MY SYMPTOMS WORSENED. I HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO SPECIALISTS IN VARIOUS DIFFERENT SPECIALITIES AS WELL AS HOLISTIC HEALERS AND NATUROPATHS TRYING TO FIND THE SOURCE OF MY SUDDEN ONSET OF ILLNESSES. PRIOR TO HAVING THE BREAST IMPLANTS, I WAS A HEALTHY MOTHER OF TWO AND HARDLY EVER MISSED WORK FOR ANYTHING BEYOND THE COMMON COLD. WITH ALL OF THE MEDICAL PROBLEMS, I WAS REQUIRED TO FILE (B)(6) WITH MY EMPLOYER OF SIX YEARS DUE TO THE NATURE OF MY SYMPTOMS AND THE AMOUNT OF WORK I MISSED FOR TREATMENTS AND NEW CONSULTATIONS WITH DOCTORS ON A CONSISTENT BASIS. I WAS FINALLY DIAGNOSED WITH COMMON VARIABLE IMMUNE DEFICIENCY AND BEGAN IVIG TREATMENTS EVERY OTHER WEEK TRYING TO PREVENT THE CONSTANT INFECTIONS I WAS GETTING REGULARLY AND I HOPED WAS THE SOURCE OF MY PROBLEMS. AFTER A YEAR OF THOSE TREATMENTS AND MORE REFERRALS TO DIFFERENT SPECIALISTS, I FOUND A GROUP OF WOMEN WHO ALL HAVE EVERY SYMPTOM THAT I HAD AND SOME EVEN MORE AND THEY HAVE BEEN LINKED TO THEIR BREAST IMPLANTS AND HAVE CALLED THE ILLNESS BII OR BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESS. AFTER HEARING THAT WOMEN WERE GETTING BETTER AFTER HAVING THEM REMOVED, I DECIDED TO EXPLANT ON (B)(6) 2016. SINCE THAT TIME, OVER HALF OF MY SYMPTOMS HAVE DISAPPEARED AND OTHERS ARE GOING AWAY EACH DAY. I AM ON LESS THAN OF HALF OF THE MEDICATIONS I HAD BEE TAKING SINCE IMPLANTING IN 2012 AND I FEEL OVER 50% BETTER THAN I DID WHILE THE IMPLANTS WERE IN MY BODY. I DO NOT KNOW FOR SURE IF THERE WAS MOLD OR FUNGUS PRESENT AS MOST COSMETIC SURGEONS WIL NOT TEST THEM AFTER TAKING THEM OUT AND DO NOT BELIEVE THAT BREAST IMPLANTS (ESPECIALLY SALINE) CAN MAKE WOMEN ILL. I HAVE RECENTLY FOUND OUT THE COMBINATION OF TOXIC MATERIALS USED TO MAKE THE SHELL OF SALINE IMPLANTS AND WAS NEVER GIVEN THAT LIST OF INGREDIENTS PRIOR TO IMPLANTING. MOST OF MY SYMPTOMS MIMIC THAT OF AN AUTOIMMUNE ILLNESS YET I WAS GIVEN NO DIAGNOSIS DUE TO ""NORMAL"" LAB WORK. I HAVE NEVER BEEN DIAGNOSED NOR HAD THE SYMPTOMS OF AUTOIMMUNE ILLNESS PRIOR TO IMPLANTING AND BELIEVE THE SALINE IMPLANTS HAVE MADE ME ILL AND TAKEN AWAY 4 YEARS OF MY LIFE. WOMEN SHOULD BE TOLD THE INGREDIENTS AND SURGEONS SHOULD NOT TELL US THAT SALINE OR SILICONE IMPLANTS ARE SAFE AFTER THE PROBLEMS WITH EARLIER IMPLANTS. I ALSO WAS NOT TESTED OR ASKED IF I HAD AN AUTOIMMUNE ILLNESSES PRIOR TO IMPLANTING. BOTH SALINE AND SILICONE IMPLANTS ARE MAKING WOMEN SICK AND IN SOME CASES LEADING TO DEATH. THEY WOULD NOT BE ADVERTISED AS SAFE AND FURTHER TESTING NEEDS TO BE DONE TO FIND OUT WHY THOUSANDS OF WOMEN ARE BECOMING ILL WITH THE SAME SYMPTOMS. I AM PROOF THAT BII EXISTS. HERE ARE MY LIST OF SYMPTOMS PRIOR TO EXPLANTING. THERE WERE SEVERAL MORE RIGHT BEFORE MY EXPLANT SURGERY BUT COULD NOT LIST THEM AS MY ""BRAIN FOG"" AND MEMORY ISSUES BECAME DEBILITATING. CHARLEY HORSES (RLS), IRRITABILITY, FOOD SENSITIVITIES, SWOLLEN HANDS/FEET, FREQUENT URINATION, FATIGUE, BRAIN FOG, MEMORY LOSS, DIFFICULTY GETTING TO SLEEP (FEEL LIKE I DIDN'T SLEEP), HAIR LOSS, HEADACHES, MUSCLE PAIN, MUSCLE WEAKNESS, CARPAL TUNNEL, VEIN ISSUES, HOT ALL THE TIME, TENDON ISSUES, VISION PROBLEMS, EPITHELIAL IN GROWTH, PANIC ATTACKS, EAR PAIN (HAVE TUBES), SKIN ISSUES, DELAYED HEALING, SORES (FACE, CHEST, BACK), NO SEX DRIVE, CRYING, SIDE EFFECTS TO MEDICATIONS, IMMUNE DEFICIENCY, FIBROMYALGIA, WEIGHT GAIN/LOSS, HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, BRUISING, OCD MOMENTS, INFLAMMATION, CANDIDA/YEAST INFECTIONS, THYROID CHANGES, LOSS OF APPETITE, NIGHT SWEATS, CONSTIPATION, VERTIGO (DIZZY), ANXIETY, PANIC ATTACKS. THERE IS CURRENTLY NO LAB, SCANS OR ANY OTHER DIAGNOSTIC TEST THAT CAN IDENTIFY BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESS. THERE ARE ALSO NO TESTS AVAILABLE TO TEST FOR MOLD, FUNGUS, BACTERIA OR ANY OF THE OTHER TOXIC INGREDIENTS IN THE IMPLANT MATERIALS IN A HUMAN BODY. IF THERE ARE ANY, MOST PHYSICIANS ARE NOT AWARE OF THEM OR BELIEVE THEY ARE INACCURATE. IF WOMEN FIND A PROVIDER OF TESTS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT IDENTIFY ANY OF THE INGREDIENTS LISTED ABOVE, WE HAVE TO PAY HUNDREDS TO THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO OBTAIN TESTS THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY RECOGNIZED BY THE MEDICAL FIELD.

THE ADJUNCT 5-YEAR STUDY HAD A LOW F/U RATE OF 13.8%, THE LARGE STUDY WAS ALLOWED TO BE CUT SHORT AT YEAR 7 INSTEAD OF 10 WITH A LOW F/U RATE OF 20.1% AND IT WAS IGNORED, THE CORE STUDY HAD A F/U RATE OF 62% BUT THE REPORT SCHEDULE STOPS SHORT AT YEAR 6 INSTEAD OF 10 ON NOVEMBER 13, 2012. THE FDA MENTOR PMA, THE MANUFACTURE DOCUMENT, STATES SHELF LIFE TO BE FIVE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF STERILIZATION, YET THEY ARE MARKETED FOR UP TO 10 YEARS TO STAY IN THE BODY WITHOUT ANY SAFETY EVIDENCE. THE (B)(6) STUDY FROM 2013 RUN BY THE (B)(6), FUNDED BY THE THREE BREAST IMPLANT MFRS, DOES NOT QUALIFY AS AN INDEPENDENT STUDY FOR THE ASTOUNDING CONFLICT OF INTEREST IN REGARDS TO THE PLASTIC SURGEONS THAT PROFIT LARGELY FROM THE SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS AND, THE MFRS THEMSELVES THAT PROFIT FROM THEIR OWN SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. ALL THE PREVIOUS SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT SYMPTOMS FROM THE 1990S ARE REPEATING THEMSELVES WITH THE CURRENT SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS, THUS PROVING RECURRING LACK OF SAFETY. A FEW PEOPLE FOLLOWING THIS MATTER HAVE MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED, BUT NOW THOUSANDS OF WOMEN HAVE GROUPED TOGETHER TO SHARE THEIR RECORDS WITH (B)(6) AND FOR THEIR OWN PROTECTION THEY HAVE ALSO TAKEN MEASURES TO SHARE THEIR RECORDS AMONG THEMSELVES AND HAVE THOSE RECORDS SAFEGUARDED WITH THEIR OWN ATTORNEYS. PRIVATE INTERESTS CANNOT SILENCE OR BUY OUT RECORDED MEDICAL EVIDENCE FROM THOUSANDS OF SICK WOMEN FROM SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS ANY LONGER.
