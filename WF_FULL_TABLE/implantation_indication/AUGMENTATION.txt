FILL INSPECTION NOTED NO BLOCKAGE IN THE VALVE. MICROSCOPIC ANALYSIS ASSESSED THE DEVICE AS INTACT AND FUNCTIONAL WITH NO OPENINGS FOUND IN THE DEVICE. THE EVENT OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, BAKER GRADE IV, IS A PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATION AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THIS EVENT. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE EVENT, PRODUCT, OR PATIENT DETAILS WAS REQUESTED; NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE. DEVICE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, ASYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. DEFLATION Â¿ BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS DEFLATE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. DEFLATION CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO DEFLATE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS; FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL; EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED); TRAUMA; COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING; AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF DEFLATION FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT; HOWEVER, IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF DEFLATION. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER THESE ADDITIONAL SURGERIES. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF DEFLATION.|UNK SALINE IMPLANT|UNK SALINE IMPLANT|07/21/2017||07/10/2017||R|Y||0HP|FWM|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||NI|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

6732140|80678267|N|1||FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTER REGARDING RETURN OF THE DEVICE HAS BEEN REQUESTED. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. DEVICE LABELING: SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANTS ARE PRONE TO UNINTENDED INSTRUMENT TRAUMA DURING IMPLANTATION OR DURING EXPLANTATION. NUMBER 1, 2 SHELL FAILURE CAN RESULT FROM DAMAGE BY SCALPELS, SUTURE NEEDLES, HYPODERMIC NEEDLES, HEMOSTATS, AND ADSON FORCEPS AND HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN EXPLANTED DEVICE SHELLS USING SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY. ALLERGANÂ¿S (RETRIEVAL STUDY) ANALYSES OF EXPLANTED DEVICES HAVE IDENTIFIED UNINTENDED SURGICAL INSTRUMENT DAMAGE AS ONE POTENTIAL CAUSE OF SHELL FAILURE AND THUS IMPLANT RUPTURE. THE PATIENT SHOULD BE TOLD THAT THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGE IN THE IMPLANT SHAPE MAY BE SIGNS OF SYMPTOMATIC RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. IF THE PATIENT HAS ANY OF THESE SIGNS, SHE SHOULD BE TOLD TO REPORT THEM AND POSSIBLY HAVE AN MRI EVALUATION TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. BREAST IMPLANTS RUPTURE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. RUPTURES CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO RUPTURE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, STRESSING THE IMPLANT DURING IMPLANTATION AND WEAKENING IT, FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL, EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED), TRAUMA, COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING, AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF RUPTURE FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT. IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF RUPTURE. LABORATORY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RUPTURE ARE ONGOING. SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SEE TABLE 3 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING MRI SCREENING. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE. IF RUPTURE OCCURS, SILICONE GEL MAY EITHER REMAIN WITHIN THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), MOVE OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE (EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), OR MOVE OUTSIDE THE BREAST (GEL MIGRATION). THERE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY THAT RUPTURE MAY PROGRESS FROM INTRACAPSULAR TO EXTRACAPSULAR AND BEYOND. IN ALLERGANÂ¿S CORE STUDY, THERE WAS A MRI SCREENING COHORT WHO HAD REGULAR MRIS TO SCREEN FOR BREAST IMPLANT RUPTURE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE SYMPTOMATIC (I.E., MRI COHORT) AND A NON-MRI SCREENING COHORT WHO WERE NOT SCREENED WITH BREAST IMPLANT MRIS (I.E., NON-MRI COHORT). THE RUPTURE RATES IN THE MRI COHORTS WERE 9.3% FOR PRIMARY AUGMENTATION, 5.4% FOR REVISION-AUGMENTATION, 35.4% FOR PRIMARY RECONSTRUCTION, AND 0% FOR REVISION-RECONSTRUCTION. THE RUPTURE RATE FOR THE WHOLE MRI COHORT IN THE CORE STUDY (INCLUDING AUGMENTATION, REVISION-AUGMENTATION, RECONSTRUCTION, AND REVISION-RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS) THROUGH 10 YEARS WAS 13.0% FOR PATIENTS AND 7.7% FOR IMPLANTS. ACROSS ALL PATIENTS IN THE CORE STUDY, ALL RUPTURES WERE INTRACAPSULAR WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 3 CASES OF EXTRACAPSULAR GEL (ONE RUPTURE PROGRESSED TO EXTRACAPSULAR GEL FOLLOWING EXPLORATORY SURGERY TO CONFIRM THE RUPTURE AND THEN IMPLANT REPLACEMENT WAS DELAYED).|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|07/21/2017||||N|R||0HP|FWM|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||NI|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENT. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. YOU SHOULD PERFORM SELF-EXAMINATION OF YOUR BREASTS EVERY MONTH FOR CANCER SCREENING. HOWEVER, THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU DISTINGUISH THE IMPLANT FROM YOUR BREAST TISSUE. THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGES IN IMPLANT SHAPE, MAY BE SIGNS OF A RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. THESE SIGNS SHOULD BE REPORTED TO YOUR SURGEON AND POSSIBLY EVALUATED WITH AN MRI. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM.

POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, ASYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER THESE ADDITIONAL SURGERIES. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF DEFLATION. ADDITIONAL COMPLICATIONS Â¿ AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. CALCIUM DEPOSITS CAN FORM IN THE TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT WITH SYMPTOMS THAT MAY INCLUDE PAIN AND FIRMNESS. LYMPHADENOPATHY HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED IN SOME WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS. IN THE PASS STUDY, AT LEAST 1 REOPERATION WAS PERFORMED ON 315 PATIENTS (36.5%) THROUGH 10 YEARS. A TOTAL OF 424 REOPERATIONS WERE PERFORMED. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR REOPERATION THROUGH 10 YEARS ON AUGMENTATION PATIENTS WAS IMPLANT DEFLATION AT 21.7%. THE PERCENTAGE OF REOPERATIONS DUE TO LUMP/MASS/CYST INCREASED FROM 8.5% OF 293 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 5 YEARS TO 13.9% OF 424 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 10 YEARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF LUMPS, MASSES, AND CYSTS CAN BE EXPECTED TO NATURALLY INCREASE AS PATIENTS AGE AND COULD BE AN EXPLANATION FOR THE INCREASE. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. FOR MORE COMPLETE AND UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ON FDAÂ¿S ANALYSIS AND REVIEW OF THE ALCL IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST IMPLANTS PLEASE VISIT: HTTP://WWW.FDA.GOV/MEDICALDEVICES/PRODUCTSANDMEDICALPROCEDURES/IMPLANTSANDPROSTHETICS/BREASTIMPLANTS/UCM239995.HTM YOU ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO REPORT ANY PRODUCT PROBLEM OR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT TO ALLERGAN. DEATHS MUST BE REPORTED TO ALLERGAN AND FDA. SILICONE DEVICE LABELING: ONE OF THE KEY COMPLICATIONS REPORTED IS CALLED Â¿CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE.Â¿ CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS A TIGHTENING OF THE SCAR TISSUE (ALSO CALLED A CAPSULE) THAT NORMALLY FORMS AROUND THE BREAST IMPLANT DURING THE HEALING PROCESS AFTER SURGERY. IN SOME WOMEN, THE SCAR TISSUE (CAPSULE) SQUEEZES THE IMPLANT. THIS RESULTS IN FIRMNESS OR HARDENING OF THE BREAST, AND IT IS A RISK FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE. DEGREES OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE ARE CLASSIFIED BY THE BAKER GRADING SCALE.1 CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BAKER GRADES III AND IV ARE THE MOST SEVERE. BAKER GRADE III OFTEN RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SURGERY (REOPERATION) BECAUSE OF PAIN AND POSSIBLY ABNORMAL APPEARANCE. BAKER GRADE IV USUALLY RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR REOPERATION BECAUSE OF PAIN AND UNACCEPTABLE APPEARANCE. DO NOT TREAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BY CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY OR FORCEFUL EXTERNAL COMPRESSION, WHICH WILL LIKELY RESULT IN IMPLANT DAMAGE, RUPTURE, FOLDS, AND/OR HEMATOMA. ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. YOU SHOULD PERFORM SELF-EXAMINATION OF YOUR BREASTS EVERY MONTH FOR CANCER SCREENING. HOWEVER, THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU DISTINGUISH THE IMPLANT FROM YOUR BREAST TISSUE. THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGES IN IMPLANT SHAPE, MAY BE SIGNS OF A RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. THESE SIGNS SHOULD BE REPORTED TO YOUR SURGEON AND POSSIBLY EVALUATED WITH AN MRI. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT.

DEFLATION Â¿ BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS DEFLATE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. DEFLATION CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO DEFLATE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS; FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL; EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED); TRAUMA; COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING; AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME.

FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTER REGARDING THE EVENT, PRODUCT, AND/OR PATIENT DETAILS WAS REQUESTED. DEVICE LABELING: BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.

THE EVENTS OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, BAKER GRADE IV, DELAYED HEALING, HEMATOMA, ALLERGIC RASH, CELLULITIS, SEROMA, WOUND DEHISCENCE, AND NECROSIS ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLAINTS, AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THESE EVENTS. FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTER REGARDING THE EVENT, PRODUCT, AND/OR PATIENT DETAILS WAS REQUESTED. DEVICE LABELING: Â¿POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, IMPLANT DEFLATION, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING.Â¿ Â¿DEFLATION Â¿ BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS DEFLATE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. DEFLATION CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO DEFLATE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS; FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL; EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED); TRAUMA; COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING; AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF DEFLATION FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT; HOWEVER, IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF DEFLATION.Â¿ Â¿CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER THESE ADDITIONAL SURGERIES. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF DEFLATION.Â¿ Â¿AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY.

6571985|75334429|N|1||ARTICLE CITATION: Â¿COMMENTARY ON: CLINICAL EVALUATION OF SHAPED GEL BREAST IMPLANT ROTATION USING HIGH-RESOLUTION ULTRASOUND,Â¿ BY BRADLEY P. BENGSTON, MD, FACS, PUBLISHED IN AESTHETIC SURGERY JOURNAL, VOL. 37, ISSUE 3, 01MAR2017 PP. 297-300. THE EVENT OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, BAKER GRADE IV, IS A PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLAINT, AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THESE EVENTS. FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTER REGARDING THE EVENT, PRODUCT, AND/OR PATIENT DETAILS WAS REQUESTED. DEVICE LABELING: Â¿POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE.Â¿ Â¿CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER THESE ADDITIONAL SURGERIES. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF DEFLATION.Â¿|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|05/17/2017||||N|R||0HP|FWM|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||NI|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True
6378474|69092787|D|1||IT WAS REPORTED THAT A (B)(6) FEMALE PATIENT WITH HISTORY OF BREAST PROSTHESIS IMPLANTATIONS WAS DIAGNOSED WITH LEFT BREAST CANCER. THE PATIENT WAS IMPLANTED WITH MENTOR SMOOTH ROUND GEL MAMMARY PROSTHESES ON (B)(6) 2005. (CATALOG # 350-7300BC, SERIAL NUMBER LEFT SIDE (B)(4) AND SERIAL NUMBER RIGHT SIDE (B)(4)). THE PATIENT HAD A MAMMOGRAM DONE ON 10/20/2015 THAT SHOWED Â¿SOME MICRO CALCIFICATIONS IN THE LEFT SUPERIOR BREASTÂ¿ AND RECOMMENDED PATIENT ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN PRIOR MAMMOGRAM IMAGES FOR COMPARISON AND FOR ADDITIONAL IMAGING (SPOT MAGNIFICATION VIEWS) TO EVALUATE THE MICRO CALCIFICATIONS. THEY ALSO RECOMMENDED ULTRASOUND AT THE DISCRETION OF THE RADIOLOGIST. CONCLUSION ON CALCIFICATIONS WAS BI-RADS CATEGORY: 0- INCOMPLETE: NEEDS ADDITIONAL IMAGING EVALUATION. ADDITIONAL MAMMOGRAMS WERE DONE ON (B)(6) 2016 AND (B)(6) 2017. A BILATERAL BREAST MRI WAS DONE ON (B)(6) 2017 DUE TO RECENT DIAGNOSIS OF LEFT BREAST CANCER (EXACT DATE OF DIAGNOSIS IS UNKNOWN) THE MRI WAS DONE TO ASSESS EXTENT OF DISEASE AND FOR POSSIBLE CONTRALATERAL DISEASE. MRI CONFIRMED THAT BILATERAL IMPLANTS WERE RUPTURED. MRI REPORT ((B)(6) 2017) CITES PATIENT HAD AUGMENTATION REVISION PROCEDURE IN 2008 (NO FURTHER INFORMATION STATED; NO INFORMATION ON TYPES OR BRAND OF IMPLANTS USED). THE PATIENT HAS NO FAMILY OR PERSONAL HISTORY OF BREAST CANCER BEFORE THIS DIAGNOSIS. PATIENT ADVISED THAT SHE HAD NOT SELECTED AN EXPLANT SURGEON OR EXPLANT SURGERY DATE AS OF YET. MENTOR MADE A DECISION TO FILE A FDA MEDWATCH REPORT BASED ON THE ABOVE INFORMATION; HOWEVER, CURRENTLY, THERE IS NO SOLID EVIDENCE IN THE LITERATURE TO SUGGEST THAT BREAST IMPLANT RUPTURE ALTER THE RISK OF BREAST MALIGNANCIES.|nan|350-7300BC|03/03/2017||||*|R||0HP|FTR|1.0||BREAST IMPLANT||5566433|3041 SKYWAY CIRCLE||NORTH IRVING|US|MENTOR WORLDWIDE LLC|750383540|TX|75038|3540||350-7300BC|True

SHE WILL GO A COUPLE OF YRS WITHOUT HAVING ANY PAIN AND IT NEVER LASTS MORE THAN 20 MINS. SHE DESCRIBES THE PAIN AS VERY SHARP, LOCATED IN THE AREA OF THIS SCAR AND SOMETIMES SHE NOTICES SOME KIND OF A TINGLING FEELING. THE PAIN INTENSITY IS ANYWHERE FROM A SCALE OF 1-10, SOMETIMES THE PAIN IS SO SEVERE SHE STATES THAT IT BRINGS HER TO HER KNEES. SOMETIMES JUST STIMULATION OF SKIN OVER HER POSTERIOR BACK INCREASES THE PAIN OVER THE SCAR. THE PAIN IS AGGRAVATED BY MOBILITY. ROLLING OVER IN BED AGGRAVATES THE PAIN. WHEN THE PAIN IS PRESENT BREATHING OR COUGHING MAKES THE PAIN WORSE. NO POSITIONS OR HEAT OR COLD HELP THE PAIN. SHE HAS BEEN ON NUMEROUS MEDICATIONS INCLUDING NONSTEROIDALS, MOTRIN AND TOLECTIN, THAT HAVE BEEN NO HELP WHATSOEVER. SHE HAD BEEN ON PAMELOR AND TEGRETOL WHICH ALSO HAVE BEEN NO HELP. THE ONLY MEDICATION THAT HAS GIVEN HER ANY HELP IS HYDROCODONE 5 MG QID. SHE STILL HAS THE PAIN WHILE ON THIS MEDICATION BUT IT SORT OF DULLS THE INTENSITY. HER CURRENT MEDICATIONS INCLUDE LIBRIUM 10 MG TID AND SHE IS ON HORMONE REPLACEMENT. THE PLASTIC SURGEON WHO DID THE INTITIAL SURGERY, HAS BEEN SEEING HER FOR THIS PROBLEM AND HAS INJECTED SCAR NUMEROUS TIMES WITH STEROIDS AND HAS DONE INTERCOSTAL BLOCKS. THE INTERCOASTAL BLOCKS SEEM TO HAVE BEEN INEFFECTIVE IN THAT THERE WAS NO NUMBNESS IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE INTERCOSTAL NERVE. BECAUSE OF HER HEALTH INSURANCE THE PLASTIC SURGEON HAD TO DO THESE BLOCKS BEFORE HE COULD RE-OPERATE ON HER. IN 10/91 HE RE-OPERATED ON HER AND FOUND THAT SHE HAD SILICONE LEAKS FROM THE BREAST IMPLANTS AND CAPSULITIS AND HAD SIGNS OF NERVE ENTRAPMENT. HE FIXED ALL THESE PROBLEMS, CLEARED OUT SCAR TISSUE AND PUT IN NEW BREAST IMPLANTS, THIS TIME BELOW THE PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE. SHE HAD NOTICED THAT THE PAIN HAS BEEN NO DIFFERENT SINCE THIS PARTICULAR OPERATION. AN ANESTHESIOLOGIST DID INTERCOASTAL BLOCK ON 7/22/92. SHE HAD NUMBNESS IN THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE NERVE BLOCKS WHICH WERE T6 THROUGH T9 ON THE LEFT, HOWEVER THE PAIN WAS NOT RELIEVED. THE PT STATES THAT THIS PAIN IS CAUSING HER A LOT OF STRESS. RECENTLY SHE HAS BEEN HAVING INCREASED INCIDENTS OF THESE PAINFUL EPISODES THAT SHE THINKS ARE RELATED TO STRESS. EXAM OF HER CHEST WALL REVEALS THE SCAR IS WELL-HEALED. IT IS VERY FLAT, THERE IS NO TENDERNESS ON PALPATION OF THE SCAR. NO SIGNS OF NEUROMAS. PT NOTES THAT THE PAIN WENT COMPLETELY AWAY FOR 7 MONTHS AFTER A TRIAL OF DILANTIN BUT SHE HAD A REACTION OT THE MEDICATION AND COULD NOT CONTINUE IT. DR WAS UNABLE TO REPRODUCE THE PT'S PAIN WITH DEEP PRESSURE, SUPERFICIAL PRESSURE, STROKING OR BRUSHING. HOWEVER, DR COULD REPRODUCE THE PAIN WITH TENS OVER RPTR'S INTERCOSTAL AREA, BOTH ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR. PHYSICAL THERAPY IMPRESSION IS INTERCOSTAL NEURALGIA.

HE WAS HIGHLY RESPECTED (AND EXPENSIVE) PLASTIC SURGEON. RPTR UNDERWENT THE SURGERY. RPTR IS A VERY THIN PERSON WITH LITTLE BREAST TISSUE AND HAD IMPLANTS OF A MODEST SIZE.

THE MUSCLE PAIN WAS PRIMARILY IN THE LONG BONES, ARMS AND LEGS. THE DR THOUGHT IT WAS THE ONSET OF SOME MUSCULAR DISEASE OR A KIDNEY PROBLEM. RPTR HAD AN IVP FOR KIDNEY FUNCTION ETC BUT IT SHOWED NO CHANGE FROM A PREVIOUS ONE AT LEAST 20 YEARS PRIOR. RPTR DID NOT TELL THE DR OF HER BREAST IMPLANTS AS THERE WAS NO WAY IN HER MIND THAT THERE COULD BE ANY TIE. THEN, BY LUCK, RPTR SOUGHT THE COUNSEL OF A FOURTH DR. HER BREASTS WERE THEN AS HARD AS ""DOOR KNOBS"" WITH A CONFIGURATION OF THE SAME. THAT WAS IN 86-87.

20734|145100|D|1||"RPTR WRITES, ""I AM CANCER AND SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT SURVIVOR AND I FEEL MY HISTORY MAY BE OF SOME INTEREST TO YOU. IN 1975 I HAD DOW CORNING BREAST IMPLANTS PLACED IN MY BODY FOR COSMETIC REASONS. I WAS A HEALTHY 33 YEAR OLD WOMAN. AFTER BEING TOLD IMPLANTS WERE PERFECTLY SAFE AND THAT THEY WOULD LAST A LIFE TIME I WILLINGLY SIGNED UP FOR SURGERY. WITHIN THREE MONTHS I DEVELOPED HARD CAPSULES BILATERALLY. MY SURGEON ASSURED ME ALL WAS WELL, HOWEVER HE WOULD NEED TO PERFORM A CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY IN ORDER TO SOFTEN BOTH BREASTS. I RECALL BEING FEARFUL OF THIS PROCEDURE AS A) MY SURGEON MADE ME PROMISE ""NOT TO YELL"" AND B) THERE WOULD BE NO ANESTHESIA. PROCEDURE WAS INDEED VERY PAINFUL AS HE MANUALLY APPLIED PRESSURE TO EACH BREAST AND ""CRACKED"" THEM. I FELT A TEARING SENSATION AROUND EACH BREAST. THIS WAS FIRST OF NINE CLOSED CAPSULOTOMIES, AND I SUSPECT MY LEFT IMPLANT WAS RUPTURED FROM VERY FIRST ONE. ONE YEAR AFTER IMPLANTATION I BEGAN TO HAVE PAIN IN JOINTS OF MY RIGHT HAND AND A STRANGE RASH APPEARED ON MY CHEST AND ARMS. THREE YEARS LATER I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH THYROID CANCER. WHEN I COLLECTED ALL MY MEDICAL RECORDS OVER LAST FEW YEARS I FOUND MY BIOPSY WHICH REFERRED NOT ONLY TO MY MALIGNANT TUMOR, BUT ALSO TO ""YELLOW GELATINOUS MATERIAL"" SURROUNDING MY THYROID GLAND. EVEN THOUGH MY MEDICAL RECORDS CLEARLY STATED I HAD HAD A BREAST AUGMENTATION, NO ONE AT TIME OF SURGERY MENTIONED PRESENCE OF A FOREIGN BODY MATERIAL FOUND IN MY GLAND. MY TUMOR WAS REMOVED YET AN OBVIOUSLY RUPTURED IMPLANT WAS ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN MY BODY FOR SEVERAL MORE YEARS. IT IS KNOWN THAT MOST OF MEDICAL COMMUNITY REFUSES TO ADMIT ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS AND DISEASE; HOWEVER, GIVEN THE PRESENCE OF SILICA THOUGHOUT MY THYROID GLAND AND LYMPH NODES THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND AS TO WHAT CAUSED MY CANCER. SIX YEARS AFTER IMPLANTATION MY RASH CONTINUED TO SPREAD, MY JOINTS ACHED AND MY LEFT BREAST BECAME PAINFUL AND ""HOT"" FEELING. MY LEFT NIPPLE ALSO TURNED A DARKER COLOR THAN OTHER ONE. I FELT FATIGUED, AND DISORIENTATED MOST OF TIME. I CONTINUED TO SEEK MEDICAL CARE AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS NO EXPLANATION FOR MY BODY RASH. MY PHYSICIANS COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR MY SLOW RECOVERY FROM THYROID CANCER AND ALL RELATED TREATMENTS I ENDURED. DUE TO PAIN AND CONTINUED HARDENING OF MY LEFT BREAST MY SURGEON DECIDED TO REPLACE THIS IMPLANT WITH ANOTHER DOW CORNING UNIT. AFTER SURGERY HE DID NOT TELL ME THAT EXPLANTED IMPLANT WAS RUPTURED (I LEARNED ABOUT RUPTURE WHEN COLLECTING ALL MY DATA THREE YEARS AGO). TWELVE YEARS AFTER IMPLANTATION I BEGAN TO HAVE TREMORS IN MY LEFT HAND, CHRONIC GASTRITIS, JOINT ACHE AND A ""PINS AND NEEDLES"" SENSATION IN MY LEGS AND ARMS. AT TIMES I IMAGINED SPIDERS WERE CRAWLING ON MY LEGS. FROM THIS POINT MY HEALTH WENT INTO A DOWNWARD SPIRAL AND I BECAME MORE DEPRESSED AS EACH DOCTOR'S APPT SUGGESTED SAME METHOD OF TREATMENT... SEEK MENTAL THERAPY. BY 1994, AFTER 19 YEARS OF IMPLANTS, MY HEALTH HIT ROCK BOTTOM. I WAS FATIGUED BEYOND POINT OF RECOVERY, NERVOUS, DEPRESSED AND, YES, SUICIDAL. MY BODY WOULD REACT TO SLIGHTEST STIMULANT AND I WAS HAVING SEVERE MEMORY LOSS, AND I BECAME DYSLEXIC. AT ONE POINT I WENT TO OUR LOCAL MARKET, LESS THAN A MILE FROM HOME, AND I COULDN'T REMEMBER HOW TO DRIVE HOME. I BEGAN TO LOSE MY BALANCE AND I HAD DISTORTED VISION. EVEN TODAY ONE OF MY PUPILS DOES NOT DILATE NORMALLY. I RETURNED MANY TIMES TO TRY TO FIND A CURE FOR MY RACING HEARTBEAT, MY RASH, STIFFNESS AND PAIN IN MY LIMBS, TREMOR IN MY HAND, EYE AND VAGINAL DRYNESS. AGAIN I WAS TOLD TO SEEK COUNSELING. OVER THIS PERIOD MY MARRIAGE FAILED AND I BEGAN TO THINK I WAS REALLY CRAZY. I CONSIDERED TAKING MY LIFE MANY TIMES. BY 1994 I WAS FALLING INTO A DEEP HOLE. AFTER A NEAR HEAD ON COLLISION BECAUSE I WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY DISCERNING LEFT FROM RIGHT I BEGAN TO FEAR DRIVING. MY LIFE WAS OUT OF CONTROL. AS A RESULT OF ALL MEDIA COVERAGE AROUND 1994 ON BREAST IMPLANTS I RETURNED TO MY PLASTIC SURGEON. HE TOLD ME THERE COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN MY ""IMAGINED SYMPTOMS"" AND BREAST IMPLANTS. HE DID, HOWEVER, CONCEDE THAT MY IMPLANTS ""LOOKED TERRIBLE"" DUE TO EVER PRESENT CAPSULES. HE RELUCTANTLY AGREED TO REMOVE MY IMPLANTS ON MAY 4, 1994. OF COURSE IT WAS SUGGESTED I REPLACE THEM WITH SALINE IMPLANTS WHICH I DECLINED. ONE MONTH AFTER EXPLANTATION I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BRAIN LESIONS WHICH EXPLAINS MY DIAGNOSES OF ATYPICAL MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. FOR SIX MONTHS MY SYMPTOMS SEEM TO INTENSIFY AND THEN I BEGAN TO SLOWLY IMPROVE. TODAY I LIVE WITH DISCOMFORT AND PAIN OF STIFF LEGS AND SENSATION OF SPIDERS ON MY SKIN IS STILL WITH ME. CLIMATE EXTREMES MAKES PAIN IN MY LEGS UNBEARABLE. MY MEMORY HAS IMPROVED AND I NO LONGER SUFFER, OR CAUSE OTHERS TO SUFFER, THOSE HORRIBLE AND UNPREDICTABLE MOOD SWINGS. MY CANCER IS IN REMISSION AND I AM ON MEDICATION FOR REST OF MY LIFE. MY RASH, IT APPEARS, IS WITH ME FOR LIFE. EVEN THOUGH I'VE HAD SOME IMPROVEMENT MY HEALTH HAS BEEN PERMANENTLY DAMAGED BY BREAST IMPLANTS. WHAT HAS ALL THIS MEANT TO ME? I AM ANGRY TO HAVE LOST 19 YEARS OF MY LIFE TO AVARICE AND DECEPTION OF DOW CORNING. I MOURN LOSS OF MY FIRST MARRIAGE AND I CAN'T HELP WONDERING WHAT LONG TERM HEALTH RISKS ARE FOR ME AND MY FELLOW SURVIVORS. WOULD I HAVE CONSENTED TO BREAST IMPLANTS HAD I BEEN TOLD OF CONSEQUENCES OR GIVEN CONSIDERATION OF READING MANY NEGATIVE TEST RESULTS DOW CORNING HAD AVAILABLE AS EARLY AS 1975? ABSOLUTELY NOT! I WILL DO ALL THAT IS POSSIBLE TO DISCOURAGE YOUNGER WOMEN FROM PURSUING IMPLANTS BE THEY SALINE, SOY, OR WHATEVER ELSE SOME MISGUIDED SCIENTIST DREAMS UP. I STRUGGLE EACH DAY TO COME TO TERMS WITH WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME. THER'S A PART OF ME THAT WANTS TO DENY DECEPTION AND LIES OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. IN OTHER WORDS I STILL WANT TO TRUST AND BELIEVE IN THE GOODNESS OF MAN. THIS I REALIZE IS A FALLACY. I STRONGLY URGE THAT ALL IMPLANTS BE TAKEN OFF MARKET."|GEL-FILLED MAMMARY IMPLANT|973|03/27/1995|V|||Y||20619.0|*|FTR|1.0||BREAST IMPLANT|Y|HH3253|*||MIDLAND|US|DOW CORNING CORP.||MI|48686|0994|*|RIGHT|True

AFTER SURGERY HE DID NOT TELL ME THAT THE EXPLANTED IMPLANT WAS RUPTURED (I LEARNED ABOUT THE RUPTURE WHEN COLLECTING ALL MY DATA THREE YEARS AGO). TWELVE YEARS AFTER IMPLANTATION I BEGAN TO HAVE TREMORS IN MY LEFT HAND, CHRONIC GASTRITIS, JOINT ACHE AND A ""PINS AND NEEDLES"" SENSATION IN MY LEGS AND ARMS. AT TIMES I IMAGINED SPIDERS WERE CRAWLING ON MY LEGS. FROM THIS POINT MY HEALTH WENT INTO A DOWNWARD SPRIAL AND I BECAME MORE DEPRESSED AS EACH DR'S APPOINTMENT SUGGESTED SAME METHOD OF TREATMENT...SEEK MENTAL THERAPY. BY 1994, AFTER 19 YEARS OF IMPLANTS, MY HEALTH HIT ROCK BOTTOM. I WAS FATIGUED BEYOND THE POINT OF RECOVERY, NERVOUS, DEPRESSED AND, YES, SUICIDAL. MY BODY WOULD REACT TO SLIGHTEST STIMULANT AND I WAS HAVING SEVERE MEMORY LOSS, AND I BECAME DYSLEXIC. AT ONE POINT I WENT TO OUR LOCAL MARKET, LESS THAN A MILE FROM HOME, AND I COULDN'T REMEMBER HOW TO DRIVE HOME. I BEGAN TO LOSE MY BALANCE AND I HAD DISTORTED VISION. EVEN TODAY ONE OF MY PUPILS DOES NOT DILATE NORMALLY. I RETURNED MANY TIMES TO TRY TO FIND A CURE FOR MY RACING HEARTBEAT, MY RASH, STIFFNESS AND PAIN IN MY LIMBS, TREMOR IN MY HAND, EYE AND VAGINAL DRYNESS. AGAIN I WAS TOLD TO SEEK COUNSELING. OVER THIS PERIOD MY MARRIAGE FAILED AND I BEGAN TO THINK I WAS REALLY CRAZY. I CONSIDERED TAKING MY LIFE MANY TIMES. BY 1994 I WAS FALLING INTO A DEEP HOLE. AFTER A NEAR HEAD ON COLLISION BECAUSE I WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY DISCERNING LEFT FROM RIGHT I BEGAN TO FEAR DRIVING. MY LIFE WAS OUT OF CONTROL. AS A RESULT OF ALL THE MEDIA COVEREAGE AROUND 1994 ON BREAST IMPLANTS I RETURNED TO MY PLASTIC SURGEON. HE TOLD ME THERE COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN MY ""IMAGINED SYMPTOMS"" AND BREAST IMPLANTS. HE DID, HOWEVER, CONCEDE THAT MY IMPLANTS ""LOOKED TERRIBLE"" DUE TO EVER PRESENT CAPSULES. HE RELUCTANTLY AGREED TO REMOVE MY IMPLANTS ON 5/4/94. OF COURSE IT WAS SUGGESTED I REPLACE THEM WITH SALINE IMPLANTS WHICH I DECLINED. ONE MONTH AFTER EXPLANTATION I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BRAIN LESIONS WHICH EXPLAINS MY DIAGNOSES OF ATYPICAL MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. FOR SIX MONTHS MY SYMPTOMS SEEM TO INTENSIFY AND THEN I BEGAN TO SLOWLY IMPROVE. TODAY I LIVE WITH DISCOMFORT AND PAIN OF STIFF LEGS AND SENSATION OF SPIDERS ON MY SKIN IS STILL WITH ME. CLIMATE EXTREMES MAKES PAIN IN MY LEGS UNBEARABLE. MY MEMORY HAS IMPROVED AND I NO LONGER SUFFER, OR CAUSE OTHERS TO SUFFER, THOSE HORRIBLE AND UNPREDICTABLE MOOD SWINGS. MY CANCER IS IN REMISSION AND I AM ON MEDICATION FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. MY RASH, IT APPEARS, IS WITH ME FOR LIFE. EVEN THOUGH I'VE HAD SOME IMPROVEMENT MY HEALTH HAS BEEN PERMANENTLY DAMAGED BY BREAST IMPLANTS. WHAT HAS ALL THIS MEANT TO ME? I AM ANGRY TO HAVE LOST 19 YEARS OF MY LIFE TO THE AVARICE AND DECEPTION OF DOW CORNING. I MOURN THE LOSS OF MY FIRST MARRIAGE AND I CAN'T HELP WONDERING WHAT THE LONG TERM HEALTH RISKS ARE FOR ME AND MY FELLOW SURVIVORS. WOULD I HAVE CONSENTED TO BREAST IMPLANTS HAD I BEEN TOLD OF THE CONSEQUENCES OR GIVEN CONSIDERATION OF READING MANY NEGATIVE TEST RESULTS DOW CORNING HAD AVAILABLE AS EARLY AS 1975? ABSOLUTELY NOT! I WILL DO ALL THAT IS POSSIBLE TO DISCOURAGE YOUNGER WOMEN FROM PURSUING IMPLANTS BE THEY SALINE, SOY, OR WHATEVER ELSE SOME MISGUIDED SCIENTIST DREAMS UP. I STRUGGLE EACH DAY TO COME TO TERMS WITH WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME. THERE'S A PART OF ME THAT WANTS TO DENY THE DECEPTION AND LIES OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. IN OTHER WORDS I STILL WANT TO TRUST AND BELIEVE IN GOODNESS OF MAN. THIS I REALIZE IS A FALLACY. I STRONGLY URGE THAT ALL IMPLANTS BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET..."""|GEL-FILLED MAMMARY IMPLANT|350-7200|03/27/1995|Y|||Y||20620.0|*|FTR|1.0||BREAST IMPLANT|Y|229038|*||MIDLAND|US|DOW CORNING CORP.||MI|48686|0994|*|LEFT|True

AFTER RECEIVING A DISSATISFYING MASTOPEXY, SHE UNDERWENT A SECOND OPERATION AT THE SAME HOSP TO HAVE SILICONE IMPLANTS PLACED IN BOTH BREASTS. SOON AFTER THE SECOND OPERATION THE IMPLANTS HARDENED IN BOTH BREASTS AND THE DR BEGAN PERFORMING A SQUEEZING TECHNIQUE TO BREAK UP THE SCAR TISSUE THAT HAD CAUSED THE IMPLANTS TO BECOME ENCAPSULATED. DURING ONE OF THE SQUEEZING EPISODES, THE LEFT BREAST IMPLANT RUPTURED AND A LOCAL OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN THE DR'S OFFICE WAS DONE TO REMOVE THE DAMAGED IMPLANT AND HE REPLACED IT WITH ANOTHER IMPLANT. EVENTUALLY, AFTER THE THIRD OPERATION, THE IMPLANTS HARDENED AGAIN CAUSING HER TREMENDOUS UNHAPPINESS. HAVING THE BREAST HARDEN AND THEN SQUEEZED BY THE DR WAS EXTREMELY DEMEANING AND PAINFUL AND CAUSED HER DISTRESS AND MENTAL ANGUISH. THIS PROBLEM CONTINUED THROUGHOUT THE NEXT THREE YRS, UNTIL ON ONE OFFICE VISIT WHEN HE WAS PERFORMING THE SQUEEZING TECHNIQUE THE LEFT IMPLANT RUPTURED ONCE MORE AND THIS TIME HE REQUESTED THAT RPTR MEET HIM AT HOSP WERE DR, HIS WIFE, AND A RN PERFORMED THE FOURTH OPERATION TO REMOVE THE RUPTURED SILICONE IMPLANT. HE DIDN'T REPLACE IT LEAVING HER WITH THE RIGHT BREAST A 34C AND THE LEFT BREAST A 34B, IN WHICH SHE USES VARIOUS PROSTHESIS TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LACK OF MASS IN THE LEFT BREAST. FOR THE LAST 17 YRS, SHE HAS HAD TO LIVE WITH AN ENCAPSULATED RIGHT IMPLANT SEALED TO THE UPPER CAVITY OF HER CHEST, HATING EVERY MINUTE IT HAS BEEN IN HER BODY. RPTR STATES THE MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL STRESS HAS BEEN HORRENDOUS TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT WHAT IT HAS CAUSED HER IMMUNE SYSTEM. SHE SUFFERS DAILY FROM RESPIRATORY ALLERGIES AND HAS TO USE ANTIHISTAMINES AND NASAL SPRAYS. INITIALLY, SHE WENT IN FOR  WHAT SHE THOUGHT WAS A SIMPLE PROCEDURE THAT WOULD ENHANCE HER SELF-ESTEEM AND THE WHOLE EPISODE RESULTED IN HER LOOKING LIKE A FREAK. RPTR FEELS THESE IMPLANTS CONTRIBUTED TO THE DESTRUCTION OF HER SANITY.

ACCORDING TO PHYSICIAN'S LETTER DATED 10/25/93, PT HAD AN AUGMENTATION MAMMOPLASTY DONE ON 3/11/82, AT WHICH TIME 250 CC CONTOURED TYPE GEL PROSTHESES WERE UTILIZED. ABOUT THREE YRS AGO SHE RECEIVED A BEAR HUG AND FELT SOMETHING POP ON THE LEFT SIDE. SINCE THAT TIME SHE HAS HAD CONTINUAL PAIN AND SORENESS IN THE LEFT BREAST. SHE HAS NOTICED THAT IT HAS GOTTEN QUITE HARD AND FIRM, AND IT HAS BEEN A CONSTANT SOURCE OF TROUBLE AND IRRITATION. PT ALSO SEEMS CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT IS SILICONE GEL, DUE TO ALL THE CONTROVERSY RECENTLY. OF ALL SUGGESTIONS MADE CONCERNING THIS PROBLEM, THE ALTERNATIVE SHE PREFERS IS TO HAVE THE IMPLANTS REMOVED AND SUBSTITUTED WITH TEXTURED SALINE. THE CONTRACTURE ON THE LEFT IS A GRADE III TO IV, WITH SOME UPPER POLE DISTORTION, WHILE THE RIGHT BREAST IS STILL FAIRLY GOOD. IN CORRESPONDENCE DATED 1/27/94, PHYSICIAN STATES PT IS HAVING QUITE A FEW ADD'L PROBLEMS THAT SHOULD BE NOTED. FIRST, SHE STATES THE PAIN IS QUITE SEVERE, TO THE POINT SHE CANNOT WEAR HER BRA. SHE HAS SHOOTING PAINS IN THE LEFT BREAST AND NIPPLE, THAT GO THROUGH HER SIDE AND DOWN HER ARM. SHE MUST AVOID ANY TYPE OF HEAVY, STRENUOUS ACTIVITY, SUCH AS MOVING FURNITURE WHILE CLEANING, AS THIS CAUSES HER GREAT PAIN, AND HAS REQUIRED BEDREST TO RECOVER.

MD REPORT STATES: THE RIGHT SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT APPEARS TO HAVE MAINTAINED ITS STRUCTURAL SHAPE AND ELASTOMER INTEGRITY. UPON CLOSE EXAMINATION THE ELASTOMER SURFACE APPEARS DRY AND DEVOID OF ANY LUSTROUS APPEARANCE. THE SILICONE GEL WAS TRANSPARENT AND COLORLESS, BUT CONTAINED SOME PRECIPITATED PARTICLES. THE NATURE OF THE PRECIPITATED PARTICLES NOTED ABOVE WAS NOT POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED BECAUSE TO DO SO WOULD HAVE REQUIRED DAMAGING THE ELASTOMER MEMBRANE AND RUINING THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE PROSTHETIC DEVICE. NEVERTHELESS, THE PRECIPITATED PARTICLES APPEAR SIMILAR TO AGGREGATES STUDIES IN OTHER RUPTURED DEVICES. MICROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF THESE PARTICLES REVEALS THAT THEY ARE COTTON-LIKE PARACRYSTALLINE FORMATIONS. THESE FORMATIONS WERE FOUND TO BE CHEMICAL RATHER THAN BIOLOGICAL IN ORIGIN. THE LEFT SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT, UNLIKE ITS COUNTERPART, WAS RUPTURED AND SILICONE GEL WAS EXTERNALIZED. THE SILICONE GEL WAS TRANSPARENT, COLORLESS, AND DID NOT CONTAIN ANY AGGREGATED PARTICLES. THE PATHOLOGY SECTION OF THIS REPORT REVEALS THAT CELLULAR REACTIVE CHANGES OCCURRED RESULTING IN THE FORMATION OF A FIBROCONNECTIVE TISSUE CAPSULE. THIS CAPSULE DISPLAYS SIGNS OF CHRONIC INFLAMMATION. IT CONTAINS FOREIGN BODIES IN TISSUE CELLS AND FIBERS. THE SEARCH REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF SILICONE PARTICLES INFILTRATING THE BREAST CAPSULE TISSUE. THE PARTICLES WERE OBSERVED COATING THE WALLS OF THE EXTRACELLULAR SPACES BETWEEN THE TISSUE FIBERS AND CELL PARENCHYMA. THE ENLARGED PRINTS ILLUSTRATE THE SILICONE PARTICLES IN A BRIGHT OFF-WHITE COLOR THAT STANDS OUT AGAINST THE TISSUE AND BACKGROUND WHICH ARE PURPLE AND BLUE, RESPECTIVELY. THE PRESENCE AND LOCATION OF THE SILICONE GEL PARTICLES IN THESE TISSUES INDICATE THAT THEY HAD MIGRATED FROM A RUPTURED AND/OR BLEEDING IMPLANT. THE BREAST TISSUE REACTED TO THEIR PRESENCE BY FRAGMENTING THE EXTRUDED SILICONE GEL INTO MICROSCOPIC PARTICLES AND ENCAPSULATING THEM WITHIN FIBROUS TISSUE. THESE PROCESSES OCCURRED OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME AND DID NOT RESULT FROM ANY SILICONE LEAKAGE/RUPTURE THAT MAY HAVE OCCURRED DURING SURGERY FOR THEIR REMOVAL. GROSS DESCRIPTION: LABELED AS ""RIGHT BREAST IMPLANT"", THIS SPECIMEN CAME IN A PLASTIC CONTAINER INTACT. THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF BLEEDING OR RUPTURE. THE SILICONE GEL IS COLORLESS BUT SOME PRECIPITATE IS NOTICED INSIDE THE GEL. THE IMPLANT CONTAINS 225CC OF FLUID. THE IMPLANT WEIGHS 228.7 GRAMS AND MEASURES 12CM IN DIAMETER. LABELED AS ""LEFT BREAST IMPLANT"", THIS SPECIMEN CAME IN A PLASTIC CONTAINER RUPTURED. THE RUPTURE POINT IS 2CM IN LENGTH AND SILICONE GEL CAN BE SEEN PROTRUDING THROUGH THE ORIFICE. THE GEL IS CLEAR AND NO PRECIPITATE IS NOTICED. THE IMPLANT MEASURES 12.5CM IN DIAMETER AND WEIGHS 226.2 GRAMS. OPERATIVE REPORT: THIS IS A 52 YEAR OLD WHITE FEMALE WHO REQUESTED REMOVAL OF HER BILATERAL BREAST PROSTHESES. THIS PT UNDERWENT SILICONE BREAST AUGMENTATION IN 6/86 AND NOW RELATES A HISTORY OF JOINT PAINS AND RINGING IN HER EARS SINCE 3/92. AT THE TIME OF INITIAL CONSULTATION THE POSSIBILITY OF REPLACING THE IMPLANTS WITH SALINE FILLED PROSTHESES WAS DISCUSSED AND HER HUSBAND APPEARED TO FAVOR THIS. HOWEVER, THE PT WAS ADAMANT THAT SHE WANTED NO IMPLANTS AT ALL AND THEREFORE IT WAS MENTIONED THAT HER BREASTS WOULD BE SOMEWHAT PTOTIC AFTER THE SURGERY. SURGICAL PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION REPORT: THE SPECIMEN IS RECEIVED IN THE FRESH STATE, LABELLED WITH THE PT'S NAME AND ACCESSION NUMBER AS ""SALIVARY GLAND BIOPSY"", AND CONSISTS OF ONE IRREGULAR PIECE OF PINK, TAN, AND RED SOFT TISSUE MEASURING 0.8X 0.7X 0.4CM.

THESE COMPRISE: 1. SOME CORRESPONDENCE WHICH DEMONSTRATES OUR DIFFICULTIES WITH THE MEDICAL DEVICES AGENCY (MDA). THIS GIVES A) AN EXAMPLE OF THE EVASIVE RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE NATIONAL BREAST IMPLANT REGISTRY AND B) THE LACK OF ANY REVIEW OF ORAL AND WRITTEN ACCOUNTS SENT IN TO IRG BY SILICONE CASUALTIES. THIS, WE INSIST, IS A MOST SERIOUS OMISSION SINCE THE IRG WAS, PURPORTEDLY, SET UP IN RESPONSE TO NUMBERS OF COMPLAINTS ON PROBLEMS WITH SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS. 2. QUESTIONS CONCERNING PROBLEMS WITH THE STRUCTURE AND PROCESS OF THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW GROUP (IRG). THESE QUESTIONS TO THE THEN MINISTER OF HEALTH, WHO CALLED FOR THE IRG, AND LATER MINISTER FOR WOMEN) GIVE A SUMMARY OF OUR CAUSES FOR CONCERN IN TERMS OF THE DESCRIPTION ""INDEPENDENT"" OF THE IRG. WE HAVE MATERIAL TO SUBSTANTIATE OUR COMPLAINT. WE ARE AT PRESENT OFFERING OUR EVIDENCE TO THE CHAIR FOR THE SELECT COMMITTEE FOR HEALTH IN PRESSING THE NEED FOR AN INQUIRY INTO THE REVIEWING AND MONITORING (MDA) SYSTEMS EMPLOYED TO INVESTIGATE THE 'SILICONE GEL' PROBLEM HERE. 3. EXAMPLES OF EVALUATIONS SUBMITTED BY DOCTORS TO THE IRG, BUT NOT GIVEN REFERENCE IN THE TABLE OF IRG REFERENCES. 4. MY OWN COMMENTS ON THE MDA BOOK, 'SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS AND CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE' PUBLISHED IN 1994 FROM RESEARCH UNDERTAKEN BY THE MDA. THE MDA CONDUCTED THIS RESEARCH BEFORE ITS OFFICIAL INSTALLATION AS AN AGENCY OF THE DEPT OF HEALTH. THEREFORE, WHEN ACTUAL FLESH AND BLOOD CASUALTIES TRIED TO REPORT PROBLEMS, THE MDA HAD ALREADY MADE UP ITS MIND THAT THERE WERE NO SUCH THINGS AS SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH REGARD TO SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS. A NUMBER OF US HAVE NOW SUCCEEDED IN HAVING OUR COMPLAINT AGAINST THE MDA INVESTIGATED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY OMBUDSMAN. THIS IS ON THE GROUNDS OF A) EVASIVE INFO AND B) FAILURE TO TAKE UP REPORTS OF IMPLANT RUPTURE AS ADVERSE INCIDENTS AS WRITTEN DOWN IN THE MDA FRAMEWORK DOCUMENT. FOLLOWING OUR CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT IN 1997 AND AFTER CONTINUAL LOBBYING ON BEHALF OF SILICONE IMPLANT SUFFERERS, THE IRG WAS INSTALLED TO CONDUCT ITS REVIEW. THE IRG REPORT WAS PUBLISHED IN 7/98. YOU WILL NOTE OUR MISGIVINGS ABOUT THE IRG FROM THE ENCLOSED ATTACHMENT NUMBERS 1,2,3 AND 5. PERHAPS THE MOST PROBLEMATICAL AREA FOR US HAS BEEN THE MDA INFLUENCE UPON THE IRG. THE MDA WAS EMPLOYED AS SECRETARIAT TO THE IRG, BUT IT BY FAR EXCEEDED THIS ROLE. THE MDA CAME WITH A PREDETERMINED STANCE CONTAINED IN ITS STRONGLY HELD SILICONE-GEL-SAFE VIEW. IN OTHER WORDS, THE WHOLE PROCESS WAS SET ON A BIAS. THIS WAS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW THE CONVENIENT, SHORT TERM VIEW CAN BE PASSED FROM ONE REVIEW BODY TO ANOTHER, WHILE THE TERM 'INDEPENDENT' IS REPETITIVELY USED TO DESCRIBE THESE BODIES. 5. DOSSIER OF STATISTICS DRAWN FROM MODEST DISPERSAL OF QUESTIONNAIRES. THESE WERE MODELLED ON THE MEDWATCH FORMAT. BOTH THE QUESTIONNAIRES AND THE STATISTICS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED BY OUR CAMPAIGN TO THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION (WHO). 6. DOSSIER OF RESPONSES TO THE IRG REPORT FROM DOCTORS WHO DISAGREE WITH THE RESULT. THIS SHOULD BE SELF EXPLANATORY. WE ASK THAT YOU MIGHT INCLUDE OUR SUBMISSION IN YOUR DELIBERATIONS ON THIS SERIOUS PROBLEM. STATISTICS: SURVEY CARRIED OUT ON 286 WOMEN WHO DEVELOPED ILLNESSES AFTER BEING IMPLANTED WITH SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLANTS.

THEY ALSO SUSPECT A LEAK IN THE RIGHT IN THAT THEY FEEL THEY ARE SMALLER ON THE SIDE. THEY ARE NOW TAKEN TO THE OPERATING ROOM FOR SUBSEQUENT REPLACEMENT OF BILATERAL IMPLANTS. PROCEDURE: AFTER ADMINISTRATION OF GENERAL ENDOTRACHEAL ANESTHESIA, THE PT WAS PREPPED AND DRAPED IN A STERILE FASHION. SUBSEQUENTLY A #15 BLADE WAS UTILIZED TO EXCISE THE PREVIOUS INFRAMAMMARY SCAR. BOVIE CAUTERIZATION WAS UTILIZED TO DISSECT THROUGH THE UNDERLYING BREAST IMPLANT CAPSULE. HERE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE BREAST IMPLANT WAS TOTALLY FLAT AND WAS REMOVED FROM ITS POCKET. THE CAPSULE WAS EXAMINED AND FOUND TO STILL TO RETAIN MOST OF ITS BASE. PT WAS NOTED TO HAVE AN INFRAMAMMARY CREASE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER BY AT LEAST 2CM ON THE LEFT AS COMPARED TO THE RIGHT. AN INFERIOR CAPSULOTOMY WAS PERFORMED AFTER REFLECTION OF THE BREAST CAPSULE EXTENDING FROM APPROX THE THREE O'CLOCK POSITION OF THE LATERAL CAPSULE TO THE NINE O'CLOCK POSITION OF THE MEDIAL CAPSULE. HEMOSTASIS WAS ACHIEVED WITH BOVIE CAUTERIZATION. AFTER COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF NORMAL SALINE WAS UTILIZED TO IRRIGATE THE POCKET, A 350CC IMPLANT WAS BROUGHT INTO THE FIELD, EVACUATED OF ALL AIR AND FILLED WITH 120CC OF SALINE. SUBSEQUENTLY THIS WAS THEN PLACED INTO THE POCKET AND THEN OVERFILLED TO MFR'S SPECIFICATIONS OF 400CC. AFTER REMOVING THE ANTERIOR FILL APPARATUS AND REPLACING THE PLUG, THE IMPLANT WAS APPROPRIATELY POSITIONED IN THE CAPSULE. PREPLACED 3-0 VICRYL SUTURES WERE THEN TIED DOWN THROUGH THE CAPSULAR PORTION OF THE ORIGINAL INCISION AND BURIED INTERRUPTED 4-0 PDS SUTURE WAS UTILIZED FOR COAPTATION OF DERMAL SKIN EDGES. ATTENTION WAS THEN TURNED TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE WHERE AGAIN THE PREVIOUS SCAR WAS EXCISED AND THEN BOVIE CAUTERIZATION UTILIZED TO DIVIDE DOWN AND THROUGH THE UNDERLYING IMPLANT CAPSULE. HERE THEN THE IMPLANT WAS REMOVED FROM ITS POCKET. IT APPEARED TO BE INTACT AS BEST COULD BE DETERMINED. BOTH IMPLANTS WERE APPROPRIATELY PACKAGED TO BE RETURNED TO MENTOR. AFTER EXAMINING THE CAPSULE, COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF NORMAL SALINE WAS UTILIZED TO IRRIGATE THE POCKET. A SECOND 350CC IMPLANT WAS BROUGHT TO THE FIELD, SUBSEQUENTLY FILLED WITH 120CC SALINE AND EVACUATED OF ALL AIR. AFTER PREPLACING AGAIN 3-0 VICRYL THROUGH THE INFERIOR CAPSULAR INCISION, THE IMPLANT WAS THEN PLACED INTO THE POCKET AND OVERFILLED TO MFR'S SPECIFICATIONS OF 400CC SALINE SOLUTION. THE ANTERIOR FILL APPARATUS WAS REMOVED AND THE PLUG REPLACED. AFTER POSITIONING THE IMPLANT, IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE CAPSULE EXTENDED MUCH FARTHER LATERALLY I.E. TO THE MID-AXILLARY LINE AS COMPARED TO THE RIGHT SIDE WHICH EXTENDED ONLY TO THE ______-AXILLARY LINE. SUBSEQUENTLY THIS ALSO CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT ABNORMAL CONCAVITY AS THE IMPLANT PULLED AWAY FROM ITS MEDIAL CAPSULE REFLECTION CAUSING A TELLTALE CONCAVITY IN THIS AREA. THE IMPLANT SUBSEQUENTLY WAS REMOVED FROM THE POCKET AND A CAPSULOPLASTY PERFORMED LATERALLY BY UTILIZING A SPINAL NEEDLE AS WELL AS BRILLIANT GREEN TO MARK THE APPROX NEW REFLECTIONS SYMMETRIC WITH THE OPPOSITE SIDE THROUGH THE ENTIRE BREAST AFTER THIS WAS MARKED APPROPRIATELY. A CAPSULOTOMY THEN WAS PERFORMED LATERALLY ACROSS THIS PRE-MARKED AREA ALONG THE LATERAL ASPECT OF THE CAPSULE DOME AS WELL AS ALONG THE CHEST WALL. THE CAPSULOPLASTY WAS THEN PERFORMED WITH RUNNING 2-0 VICRYL SUTURE, SUTURING THE MOST MEDIAL EDGES OF THE CAPSULOTOMIES TOGETHER. AFTER THIS WAS SECURELY IN PLACE, THE IMPLANT WAS BROUGHT INTO THE FIELD AND PLACED BACK INTO THE POCKET WHERE THEN IT APPEARED TO BE MUCH MORE SYMMETRIC WITH THE OPPOSITE SIDE IN TERMS OF ITS POSITION. AGAIN THE PREPLACED 3-0 VICRYL SUTURES WERE THEN TIED DOWN ALONG THE INFERIOR CAPSULAR INCISION. INVERTED INTERRUPTED 4-0 PDS SUTURE WAS UTILIZED FOR COAPTATION OF DERMAL SKIN EDGES. AFTER TREATING THIS SKIN WITH USE OF BENZOIN, 1/2"" STERI-STRIPS WERE APPLIED LONGITUDINALLY FOR COAPTATION OF EPIDERMIS. A CIRCUMTHORACIC DRESSING WAS APPLIED CONSISTING OF MULTIPLE FLUFFS ANTERIORLY ABOUT BOTH BREASTS, SECURED WITH THE USE OF A PIZZA BOARD WITH TWO WRAPS OF KERLIX ROLL AS WELL AS TWO 6"" ACE WRAPS SECURED ANTERIORLY WITH 2"" WIDE SILK TAPE. THE PT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY EXTUBATED AND TAKEN TO THE RECOVERY ROOM. FINAL SPONGE AND NEEDLE COUNTS WERE CORRECT. TOTAL TIME OF OPERATION WAS APPROX ONE HOUR AND TEN MINUTES.

404770|270334|D|1||"PURE MEDICAL HEALTH PROBLEM, CAUSED BY A DUBIOUS MEDICAL DEVICE, WHICH MADE VICTIMS OF RPTR'S FAMILY AND RPTR. CHILDREN NEVER HAD A REAL PARENT, SPOUSE NEVER A SPOUSE. AFTER A CHRONIC BREAST INFECTION, RPTR GOT BREAST IMPLANTS ADVISED. SO, THEY COULD ""AT LEAST"" WEAR A BRA. RPTR REALLY LOVED THAT IDEA. SURGEON TOLD RPTR: ""WHEN YOU DIE AT, SAY 80, YOUR BREASTS WILL BE STAYING STRAIGHT AHEAD. NO BREAST PROBLEMS ANYMORE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE"". IT TURNED OUT TO BE A GREAT DISASTER. RPTR HAD 18 SURGERIES. PROSTHESIS IN/OUT, IN/OUT, TRANSPLANTATION OF OWN TISSUE (WITHOUT SUCCESS), ANOTHER RECONSTRUCTION-TRY, PROSTHESIS IN/OUT, ETC. WITHIN 3 YEARS, RPTR GOT RHEUMATISM (R.A.) DIAGNOSED (WAS FORCED TO MOVE INTO A SPECIAL HOUSE FOR DISABLED PEOPLE) AND A LOT OF OTHER DISEASES WHICH DIDN'T FIT THEM AT ALL. THEIR BODY TOLD ANOTHER TALE, SO EVERYTHING WAS ALL IN THEIR MIND. IN 1990 A RUPTURED IMPLANT WAS REMOVED AND A ""VERY SAFE"" THICK ONE RE-IMPLANTED. SPECIALIST ASSURED RPTR THAT THIS NEW DEVICE DIDN'T CAUSE PROBLEMS. RPTR RECOVERED, COULD WALK WITHOUT PAIN (MIRACLE). ALAS ONLY FOR 2 MOS. THE NEW (LOW BLEED) IMPLANT STARTED TO POISON RPTR'S BODY AGAIN AND MADE THEM SICK AS NEVER BEFORE. RPTR WAS COMPLETELY DISABLED AND HELPLESS. THE ONLY WAY TO SURVIVE WAS A RADICAL EXPLANTATION OF THIS SICK-MAKER, A VERY HARD DECISION. DURING THAT TIME RPTR LAID HANDS ON AN INTERESTING MEDICAL REPORT (PUBLICIZED IN 1987) ABOUT THE POSSIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN SILICONE AND IMMUNE DISORDERS LIKE RHEUMATISM, NAMED H.A.D., ILUMAN ADJUVANT DISEASE. RPTR COULD NOT AND STILL CANNOT FIND WORDS TO EXPRESS THEIR FEELINGS OF ANGER AND BETRAYAL. ALL THOSE LOST YEARS. ALL THIS PAIN, SCARS, DESPAIR. NOT ONLY FOR THEMSELF, ALSO FOR THEIR SPOUSE AND CHILDREN. BEFORE RPTR REALIZED IT THEY WERE THE ""HEAD OF A FAST GROWING SUPPORT GROUP FOR WOMEN WITH SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS, OFFICIALLY REGISTERED BY LAW 5/7/92. RPTR'S BODY LOOKED AWFUL; ONE BREAST WAS COMPLETELY GONE. SINCE RPTR STARTED THEIR CRUSADE THEY HAVE HEARD THE VERY SAME STORY OVER 4,000 TIMES. THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR RPTR. CONTACTED OTHER GROUPS AROUND THE WORLD, ONLY ""THE TONGUE"" WAS DIFFERENT, THE TALE THE VERY SAME. RPTR ALSO WROTE OR PHONED TO DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES ALL OVER THE WORLD TO INFORM THEMSELF AS WELL AS POSSIBLE. PLASTIC SURGEONS HARDLY INFORM THE WOMEN ABOUT POSSIBLE FUTURE HEALTH RISKS BOTH TO THEMSELVES AND THEIR YET UNBORN BABIES. THEY ONLY SHOW NICE PICTURES. ""SILICONE IS AN INERT MATERIAL, NO DANGER AT ALL! THE WORLDWIDE COMMOTION IS GOSSIP FROM HYSTERICAL WOMEN, OUT FOR MONEY. NOTHING SCIENTIFIC PROVEN, NO LINK IS FOUND TILL NOW, AS LONG AS IT ISN'T BANNED I GO ON!"", IS THEIR FAVORITE SLOGAN, IT IS POSSIBLE HERE TO BUY YOUR BREASTS NOW AND PAY MONTHLY, YOU CAN READ THAT IN ALL ADS IN ALL NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES. I THINK THAT IS A VERY HYPOCRITICAL WAY TO TRANSLATE THE OATH OF HYPOCRATIS, THE MAMMON ABOVE THE HUMAN BEINGS. SINCE THE START OF SUPPORT GROUP IN 1992 TILL NOW RPTR HAS ANSWERED OVER 20,000 TELEPHONE-CALLS (FROM 5 MINS TO 1 1/2 HRS OR EVEN MORE) AND HEARD MORE THAN 4,000 TIMES THE VERY SAME STORY, SOMETIMES ANONYMOUS. THEY ALL RECEIVED INFORMATION-PACKET TO HELP THEM TO FIND THEIR WAY. GROUP ALSO SENT THE WOMEN DIFFERENT QUESTIONNAIRES FOR MORE INVESTIGATION. THE FIRST ONE WITH ABOUT 100 ANSWER POSSIBILITIES. AGE OF THE WOMEN BETWEEN 17-78 YEARS. AGE OF IMPLANTS: ONE MONTH-35 YEARS. THE RESULTS WERE SHOCKING, BUT NOT SCIENTIFIC, THAT CAME LATER THANKS TO THE UNIVERSITY WHO ANALYZED ALL RESULTS. THE MOST SHOCKING PART, THE ANSWERS FROM MOTHERS WITH CHILDREN BEFORE AND AFTER THEIR IMPLANTS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE KIDS AND THEIR MEDICAL COMPLAINTS. OVER 199 CHILDREN ARE REGISTERED. FINDINGS WERE THE VERY SAME AS WRITTEN IN A CHILDREN HOSPITAL REPORT (1993). 83% OF THE WOMEN WHO CONTACTED SUPPORT GROUP DID HAVE MANY OF THE WELL-KNOWN DISEASES. THAT IS OVER 10% OF THE VALUED 30,000 WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS IN RTPR'S COUNTRY. 14% WANTED INFO ABOUT AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION. 2% DID NOT (YET) HAVE PROBLEMS. 1% WAS SUFFERING DUE TO OTHER MEDICAL DEVICES LIKE HIPS, TESTICLES, INJECTIONS, NEEDLES, ETC. OF THOSE 83% IS THE SCORE 99% WITH MUSCLE/JOINT PAINS, OFTEN FALSELY DIAGNOSED AS R.A. OR FIBROMYALGIA. CHRONIC FATIGUE: 98%. MEMORY LOSS, SHORT MEMORY AND BAD CONCENTRATION: 93%. MOST OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS (1487, ALL DOCUMENTED) SCORED HIGHER THAN 70%. BY EXPLANATION OVER 80% OF THE IMPLANTS WERE RUPTURED OR VISIBLY LEAKING/BLEEDING. THAT IS WHAT THE WOMEN TOLD RPTR, BUT MOSTLY NOT WRITTEN IN THEIR FILES NOR REGISTERED. 40% OF THE EXPLANTED WOMEN RECOVERED QUITE A LOT WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR. ABOUT 45% NEEDED 2 TO 5 YEARS TO FEEL BETTER. THE OTHERS, ALAS, HAVE PASSED THE WAY OF NO RETURN. NO IDEA HOW LONG THEY'LL STAY AMONG THEM. 15-20 LADIES ARE TERRIBLY SICK, GOING DOWN HILL DAILY, SOME ARE TERMINAL BY NOW. 7 TIMES THEY FOUND A TUMOR TOO LATE (AS FAR AS RPTR HAS HEARD). 16 LADIES ALREADY DIED, WITHOUT KNOWING WHY. FIVE OF THEM RPTR KNEW VERY WELL, ALMOST TILL THE VERY LAST MINUTE. ONE COMMITTED SUICIDE, 34 YEARS OLD. THEY COULD NOT STAND THE PAIN ANYMORE AND THEIR MAIMED BODY. BUT MOST OF THE IMPLANTS WERE RUPTURED (ENVELOPE GONE) OR THERE WAS VISIBLE BLEEDING. THERE ARE ALSO 2 BABIES RPTR KNOWS ABOUT. ONE CHOKED IN MUCUS AFTER BEING BREASTFED, ONLY 6 WEEKS OLD. THE OTHER ONE BLED TO DEATH, 2 WEEKS BEFORE BIRTH. NO REASON FOUND. ONLY A STRANGE DISORDER IN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. HEALTH GOVERNMENT DOESN'T TAKE ALL COMPLAINTS SERIOUSLY; THEY DON'T REALIZE THE REALITY IS EVEN MORE THAN WORSE. THEY HARDLY LISTEN TO RPTR. THEY EVEN DON'T BELIEVE RPTR AND DO NOTHING FOR THE SICK WOMEN, CHILDREN AND MEN. NO MEDICATION, NO TREATMENT, NO HELP AT ALL FOR THIS BETRAYED POPULATION. RPTR THINKS ALL THEIR HEALTH MINISTERS ARE RESPONSIBLE. THEY ALLOW DUBIOUS MEDICAL DEVICES ON THE MARKETS; THE VERY SAME DEVICE THAT IS BANNED IN AMERICA AND OTHER COUNTRIES SINCE 1992."|SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT|NI|07/10/2002|*|||*||393767.0|*|FTR|1.0||LOW BLEED SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT|Y|NI|UNK||UNK|*|UNK|||||NI|NI|True

924384|719941|D|1||MY PROBLEMS STARTED IN 2001, WHEN I NOTICED THAT MY RIGHT BREAST SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR UNDER MY ARMPIT WHEN I LAY DOWN, I TRIED TO SEEK ADVICE FROM THE HOSP WHERE I HAD MY FIRST CONSULTATION OF BREAST IMPLANTS IN 1997, FOLLOWED BY IMPLANTATION IN 1998. I TRIED FOR 4 YEARS TO GET THE DOCTORS TO BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE IMPLANT. I 'D HAD MAMMOGRAMS AND SCANS, ALL, SAID EVERYTHING WAS FINE. IN 2003, I HAD AN UNEXPLAINED NEUROLOGICAL EVENT, SLURRED SPEECH, VERTIGO, DIZZINESS AND ALL OF WHICH LASTED FOR THREE WEEKS, AN MRI SCAN DIDN'T REVEAL ANYTHING AND I WAS SENT ON MY WAY, I REC'D PHYSIO FOR THE WEAKNESS THAT WAS PRESENT IN MY RIGHT ARM. IN LATE 2004, I WENT TO MY GP COMPLAINING OF PAIN IN BOTH MY HANDS AND WRISTS AND WAS REFERRED TO AN ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON WHO SAID I HAD CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME. THE FEELING OF UNWELLNESS GREW AND GREW. I WAS EVENTUALLY SEEN BY A PLASTIC CONSULTANT AND WAS DIAGNOSED WITH A RUPTURED IMPLANT WHICH WAS EXPLANTED AND THE CHEST CAVITY CLEANED OUT AND ANOTHER IMPLANT PUT IN ITS PLACE. I HADN'T AT THIS STAGE CONNECTED THE RUPTURED IMPLANT TO MY FEELING OF UNWELLNESS. FOLLOWING THIS PROCEDURE IN 2005, I BEGAN WITH FLU LIKE SYMPTOMS, I WAS SO BREATHLESS THAT I WAS UNABLE TO HOLD A CONVERSATION, I WAS LATER DIAGNOSED WITH EMPHYSEMA, AND THIS WAS PUT DOWN TO ME HAVING ASTHMA AND AT THE TIME OF A SMOKER -NOW A NON-SMOKER-. I ALSO HAD THE MOST PAINFUL JOINTS IMAGINABLE, WALKING WAS VERY MUCH AN EFFORT.

924384|719941|D|1||MY PROBLEMS STARTED IN 2001, WHEN I NOTICED THAT MY RIGHT BREAST SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR UNDER MY ARMPIT WHEN I LAY DOWN, I TRIED TO SEEK ADVICE FROM THE HOSP WHERE I HAD MY FIRST CONSULTATION OF BREAST IMPLANTS IN 1997, FOLLOWED BY IMPLANTATION IN 1998. I TRIED FOR 4 YEARS TO GET THE DOCTORS TO BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE IMPLANT. I 'D HAD MAMMOGRAMS AND SCANS, ALL, SAID EVERYTHING WAS FINE. IN 2003, I HAD AN UNEXPLAINED NEUROLOGICAL EVENT, SLURRED SPEECH, VERTIGO, DIZZINESS AND ALL OF WHICH LASTED FOR THREE WEEKS, AN MRI SCAN DIDN'T REVEAL ANYTHING AND I WAS SENT ON MY WAY, I REC'D PHYSIO FOR THE WEAKNESS THAT WAS PRESENT IN MY RIGHT ARM. IN LATE 2004, I WENT TO MY GP COMPLAINING OF PAIN IN BOTH MY HANDS AND WRISTS AND WAS REFERRED TO AN ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON WHO SAID I HAD CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME. THE FEELING OF UNWELLNESS GREW AND GREW. I WAS EVENTUALLY SEEN BY A PLASTIC CONSULTANT AND WAS DIAGNOSED WITH A RUPTURED IMPLANT WHICH WAS EXPLANTED AND THE CHEST CAVITY CLEANED OUT AND ANOTHER IMPLANT PUT IN ITS PLACE. I HADN'T AT THIS STAGE CONNECTED THE RUPTURED IMPLANT TO MY FEELING OF UNWELLNESS. FOLLOWING THIS PROCEDURE IN 2005, I BEGAN WITH FLU LIKE SYMPTOMS, I WAS SO BREATHLESS THAT I WAS UNABLE TO HOLD A CONVERSATION, I WAS LATER DIAGNOSED WITH EMPHYSEMA, AND THIS WAS PUT DOWN TO ME HAVING ASTHMA AND AT THE TIME OF A SMOKER -NOW A NON-SMOKER-. I ALSO HAD THE MOST PAINFUL JOINTS IMAGINABLE, WALKING WAS VERY MUCH AN EFFORT. I THEN BEGAN THE NIGHT SWEATS, EVERY NIGHT I WOULD WAKE, SOAKED TO THE SKIN, IT WAS LIKE I HAD JUST TAKEN MY CLOTHES OUT OF THE WASHER AND PUT THEM ON. I WAS DIAGNOSED AS HAVING HYPERTHYROIDISM AND HAD TO BE TREATED WITH MEDICATION.

1783239|1568093|D|1||SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLANTS - HAD THIS SURGERY AROUND 1980 OR 1981. I AM (B)(6) NOW, I WAS (B)(6) AT THE TIME OF SURGERY. TEN YEARS AFTER THE FACT, I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BENIGN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS - NO ONE ELSE IN ENTIRE FAMILY, EITHER SIDE, HAD THIS DISEASE. I WAS BEING TOLD BY ALL DOCTORS, THE IMPLANTS WERE NOT THE PROBLEM. I EVEN WENT TO A WOMAN PLASTIC SURGEON WHO DID NOTHING, NOT EVEN CHECK WITH MRI FOR PROBLEMS WITH THE IMPLANTS. I WAS NOT EVER INFORMED THAT IS THE WAY TO FIND PROBLEMS NOW - THIS YEAR - 2 YEARS AGO, I BECAME SO SICK AND COULD NOT WALK OR USE MY HANDS FROM THE ELBOW DOWN; THE INTENSE NUMBNESS, BURNING, TINGLING, HEAVY HOT SENSATION NON-STOP 24 HOURS A DAY. I CONTACTED MY MS DOCTORS, STEROIDS DIDN'T EVEN HELP. I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SO I WENT TO AN ALTERNATIVE DOCTOR. SHE IS AN ALLERGY, ENVIRONMENTAL DOCTOR AND HAS AN MD AS THE FIRST INITIALS BESIDES OTHERS AFTER HER NAME VERY WELL KNOWN EVEN WITH MY (B)(6) INS. I HAD A 2 HOUR CONSULTATION WITH HER AND SHE WENT THROUGH MY WHOLE MEDICAL HISTORY AND SAID GET THE IMPLANTS OUT; YOU WERE HEALTHY UP TILL YOU HAD THEM. NO ONE EVER SAID THEY DO NOT LAST IN FACT, I WAS LED TO BELIEVE THEY LAST FOREVER, WHAT A JOKE, THESE ALMOST KILLED ME. I HAVE A 20 YEAR HISTORY OF NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS WITH THIS DISEASE THAT NO DOCTORS WANT TO ADMIT TO. WELL I HAD THE IMPLANTS REMOVED (B)(6) 2010 AND I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DETOX. MY ALTERNATIVE DOCTOR DID TOXIC TESTS, I HAVE VERY ELEVATED LEVELS OF MERCURY, LEAD, CADIUM, BARIUM GADOLINIUM THEY ARE OFF THE CHARTS FOR TOXICITY. I AM GETTING A LITTLE BETTER, I CAN AT LEAST GET TO SLEEP AT NIGHT WHERE AS BEFORE, I COULD NOT BECAUSE OF THE DISCOMFORT AND PAIN. WITH CHELATION, THE HANDS ARE COMING BACK BUT ITS TOO EARLY TO KNOW THE FULL OUT-COME. I CAN STILL FEEL A COOL TINGLING RUNNING DOWN MY ARMS AND BACK OF NECK SAME AS THE FEELING I FELT IN BOTH BREASTS. I DID HAVE A MS NURSE SAY THAT SILICONE IMPLANTS CAN CAUSE AUTO-IMMUNE BUT BASICALLY MY CONVENTIONAL DOCTORS DON'T WANT TO STEP ON ANY FEET, THEY ALL KNOW EACH OTHER. I AM DISABLED AND HAVE BEEN SINCE 10 YEARS AFTER THE IMPLANTS WERE PUT IN. I LIVE ON DISABILITY MONEY WHICH IS VERY HARD TO DO, I CAN PROVE THE TOXIC TESTS AND THE PATHOLOGY REPORTS OF PLASTER YELLOW BROWN SUBSTANCE CALCIFIED MATERIAL THEY FOUND IN MY BREASTS. ALSO, THE PLASTIC SURGEON CALLED ME THE MORNING AFTER THE SURGERY TO TELL ME HE FOUND NOTHING FELT AND COULD ONLY REMOVE THE CAPSULES - THAT'S NICE - BUT YET, THEY CODED MY SURGERY AS COSMETIC AND MY INS. PROBABLY WON'T PAY FOR THE REMOVAL OF THESE IMPLANTS.

1981145|1896505|D|1||AFTER THE BIRTH OF MY 4TH CHILD, I WAS REFERRED TO THE PLASTIC SURGERY CLINIC AT (B)(6) MEDICAL CENTER VIA THE OB/GYN CLINIC. THE DOCTOR HAD SHARED WITH ME THAT THEY WERE OFFERING BREAST AUGMENTATION FOR FREE, ALL I'D HAVE TO DO WAS PAY THEM FOR THE IMPLANTS, WHICH I DID. I CONSULTED WITH DR (B)(6) ON (B)(6) 1988 WHO PERFORMED MY BREAST AUGMENTATION SURGERY ON (B)(6) 1988. LAST FALL, I NOTICED A CHANGE IN MY BREASTS AND BEGAN RAISING THOSE CONCERNS WITH MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN, WHO HAS SENT ME TO A BREAST CENTER AND TO A PLASTIC SURGEON AS WELL. MY IMPLANTS HAVE RUPTURED, MAINLY BECAUSE OF THEIR AGE AND THE TYPE OF MATERIALS THAT MY IMPLANTS WERE MADE OF YEARS AGO COMPARED TO THOSE OF TODAY. EVERYTHING NOW MAKES SENSE WITH MY FAILING HEALTH, MY NERVOUS BREAKDOWN, WHERE I ONCE RAN 3 MILES IN THE MORNING AND 3 IN THE EVENING, I CAN'T EVEN WALK A BLOCK WITHOUT GASPING FOR AIR, CHRONIC COUGHING AND FATIGUE, I CAN'T WRITE TWO SENTENCES WITHOUT MY HANDS CRAMPING UP PAINFULLY, AND I HAD NONE OF THESE ISSUES BEFORE. I FOUND OUT ABOUT THE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT REGARDING BREAST IMPLANTS IN (B)(6), RIGHT BEFORE THE EXPIRATION DATE LAST YEAR. PRIOR TO THAT, I HEARD NOTHING OF IT...I HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF IT AT ALL. I HAVE NO MEANS OF HAVING MY IMPLANTS REMOVED BECAUSE I'M ON DISABILITY. I REQUESTED MY MEDICAL RECORDS FROM (B)(6) AND THEY CONTAIN ALL ASPECTS OF MY BREAST AUGMENTATION SURGERY. THE FACT THAT I RECEIVED 205CC LOW PROFILE IMPLANTS, HOW MY EYES WERE TAPED SHUT AND THAT I HAD A SHEET DRAPED FROM MY WAIST DOWN. THERE WAS A LIST OF THE ASSISTING DOCTORS AND NURSES, THE NAME OF THE ANESTHESIA USED, THE AMOUNT USED, HOW LONG I WAS SUBDUED, MY RECOVERY TIME, A LOG OF THE DOCTORS THAT MONITORED ME, BUT NEVER IS THERE LISTED IN THERE THE NAME OF THE IMPLANT THAT THE DOCTOR USED INSIDE OF ME. MY PLASTIC SURGEON LOOKED OVER THE RECORD AS WELL AND CONCURRED. HOW COULD SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN? SO THE ONLY WAY THAT I CAN FIND OUT IS TO HAVE MY IMPLANTS REMOVED. I'VE TRIED CALLING (B)(6) TO FIND OUT IF DURING THIS PARTICULAR TIME, IF THEY ONLY USED ONE TYPE OF IMPLANT MAYBE. I CAN'T GET ANY ASSISTANCE FROM THEM AT ALL. WAS THIS SOME TYPE OF STUDY? WERE WE USED FOR SOME TYPE OF SCHOOL/COURSE MAYBE? IS THIS WHY THE IMPLANTS ONLY COST (B)(6)? WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON? MY DOCTOR NEGLECTED TO PROVIDE THIS VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION IN MY MEDICAL RECORDS. I'M TOLD AT THE (B)(6) PLASTIC SURGERY CLINIC THAT THE PRACTICE THAT'S USED IS THAT THE PATIENT IS SHOWN A SELECTION OF BREAST IMPLANTS...SHE THEN CHOOSES WHICH IMPLANT SHE WISHES TO HAVE. THIS WAS NOT MY CASE. THE DOCTOR TOLD ME THAT IF I PAID (B)(6), THE SURGERY WAS FREE AND THAT THE IMPLANTS WOULD LAST A LIFETIME...I WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEMS FROM THEM AT ALL. HE IN TURN, PROVIDED NO INFORMATION ON THE TYPE OF IMPLANT THAT HE INSERTED IN MY BODY. I WAS NOT GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE...HE GAVE ME WHAT HE WANTED TO GIVE ME. I WAS YOUNG AND THOUGHT THAT IT WAS WHAT THE CLINIC'S PROCEDURE WAS. WHAT WAS DONE TO ME IS CRIMINAL AND UNFAIR!

I WAS TOLD BY THE PLASTIC SURGEON IT WAS A ONE TIME PROCEDURE AND I WOULD GO TO MY GRAVE WITH ""NICE LOOKING"" BREASTS. SINCE THEN THERE HAS BEEN AN EXPLOSION OF MEDICAL FACTS AND STUDIES REVEALING THE ISSUES CONNECTED TO THESE IMPLANTS. OVER THE YEARS, I EXPRESSED NUMEROUS CONCERNS AND COMPLAINTS TO MY DOCTORS ONLY TO BE TOLD NOT TO WORRY UNLESS THEY WERE GIVING ME PROBLEMS EVEN THOUGH I WAS HAVING VARIOUS HEALTH ISSUES. NO ONE IN MY AREA WANTS TO GIVE VALIDATION TO THE FACT THERE CAN BE HEALTH PROBLEMS CONNECTED TO THESE BREAST IMPLANTS. ASIDE FROM THYROID AND RHEUMATOLOGICAL DISEASES, I STARTED HAVING VARIOUS CHEST PAINS, SHORTNESS OF BREATH AND WHAT THEY CALLED CALCIFICATIONS IN MY BREAST. I WAS SENT TO A CARDIOLOGIST AND MY GYNECOLOGIST SENT ME FOR ULTRASOUNDS. HAD THEY DONE MORE INTENSE STUDIES OF MY IMPLANTS THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND BLEEDING AND RUPTURE. ON (B)(6) 2012, I HAD AN EXPLANTATION DONE FOR MY OWN PEACE OF MIND. THE PLASTIC SURGEON SAID HE HAD NO IDEA WHAT HE WAS GETTING INTO UNTIL HE OPENED ME UP FOR THE REMOVAL. HE SAID IT WAS THE WORST CASE HE HAD SEEN IN HIS 27 YEARS OF PRACTICE. THE RIGHT SIDE HAD A SIGNIFICANT GEL BLEED AND THE LEFT SIDE WAS RUPTURED WITH THE SILICONE RESEMBLING PLUMBERS CAULKING. HE SAID HE DID SCRAPING, DIGGING, AND CUTTING AWAY AT TISSUE TO REMOVE ALL HE COULD, BUT WAS UNABLE TO GET IT ALL. THERE WAS STILL SOME LEFT EMBEDDED BETWEEN MY RIBS AND IN CREVICES HE COULDN'T GET TO. NEEDLESS TO SAY, THERE WASN'T MUCH OF MY OWN BREAST LEFT AT THE COMPLETION. HE WANTED TO PUT IN SALINE IMPLANTS AND I SAID ""NO, I'VE BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH AND I DON'T THINK THE SALINE ARE SAFE EITHER."" HE SAID IT WOULD BE UP TO MY LIVER AND KIDNEYS TO TRY AND DISPOSE OF THE REMAINING SILICONE. I AM TAKING IT DAY BY DAY AND PRAY THAT ONE DAY THIS WILL BE JUST A BAD MEMORY.

I HAVE BEEN ILL FOR SOME TIME, MY SYMPTOMS INCLUDE MUSCLE LOSS (MASS AND TONE), WEIGHT LOSS, HAIR LOSS, SLURRED SPEECH, TOTAL SKIN RASH AND SORENESS, BLURRED VISION, FATIGUE, JOINT AND MUSCLE PAIN, LOSS OF COORDINATION AND DEPRESSION. AT NO TIME DID I MAKE A LINK TO MY BREAST IMPLANTS AS I THOUGHT I WAS SUFFERING SYMPTOMS OF STRESS. HOWEVER, DUE TO RECENTLY ACCELERATED MUSCLE LOSS AND SKIN PROBLEMS, ALONG WITH INCREASED PAIN IN MY CHEST AND NECK, I TRIED TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS TO SEE MY PRIVATE SURGEON AT (B)(6) WHICH TOOK ME THREE MONTHS TO SECURE. I HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT AT LEAST ONE OF MY INAMED SILICONE IMPLANTS HAD RUPTURED (NOW VERY SMALL AND DEFORMED) AND THAT THE GEL HAS INFLAMED MY LYMPH NODES. I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME CONNECTION BETWEEN MY SYMPTOMS WHICH HAVE PERSISTED AND GRADUALLY WORSENED FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS NOW - EXCEPT FOR RECENT HEIGHTENED CHEST PAINS WHICH PROMPTED ME TO CONTACT MY SURGERY PROVIDER. I NOW HAVE THE ADDED STRESS OF KNOWING THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG, AND THAT THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT DAMAGE MAY BE BEING DONE TO MY BODY, SO PERHAPS SOME MEDICAL MONITORING WOULD KEEP US ALL INFORMED? AS IT STANDS, MY CURRENT SITUATION IS THAT THE (B)(6) WON'T REMOVE THE RUPTURED IMPLANT BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT LIABILITY LIES WITH THE PRIVATE PRACTICE WHO UNDERTOOK THE SURGERY. (B)(6), FROM WHOM I PURCHASED MY IMPLANTS, CANNOT HELP ME WITHOUT PAYMENT UP FRONT. AS I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO WORK FOR SOME TIME, I CANNOT AFFORD PRIVATE SURGERY COSTS. SO, FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, THE RUPTURED IMPLANT WILL HAVE TO STAY IN MY BODY. I WONDER IF THE FDA WOULD BE INTERESTED IN COLLECTING DATA FROM MY CURRENT HEALTH SITUATION FOR FUTURE REFERENCE IN REGARD TO ANY FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS OVER THE SAFETY OF SILICONE IMPLANTS. AS MY HEALTH SEEMS TO BE DETERIORATING FAST, AND THE IMPLANT REMAINS IN PLACE, PERHAPS MY BODY CAN PROVIDE THE PROOF TO LINK OR DISMISS THE DESTRUCTIVE EFFECTS OF SILICONE IMPLANTS IN HUMANS. I FEEL I MIGHT AS WELL USE MY CURRENT PREDICAMENT TOWARDS SOME GOOD USE AT LEAST. WORSE-CASE SCENARIO, IF WE START MONITORING NOW, WE MIGHT EVEN FIND OUT IF SILICONE LEAKAGE CAN OR DOES CONTRIBUTE TO EVENTUAL DEATH.

TWO DRAINS HAD BEEN PLACED AND LEFT IN FOR TWO WEEKS POST-OP, AND WERE VERY PAINFUL, ACCORDING TO THE HUSBAND, AND THAT HE AND HIS WIFE BOTH NOTICED THAT THE IMPLANTS WERE ""LARGER THAN THE TISSUE EXPANDERS HAD BEEN."" HIS WIFE TOLD HIM AT THE TIME, ""I DON'T REMEMBER THESE BREAST WERE SUPPOSED TO BE THIS BIG. THIS WAS A REALLY BAD DECISION."" APPROXIMATELY (B)(6), SHE ""FELT A POP AND WONDERED IF THERE WAS A RUPTURE, NOTED SLIGHT WEEPING ON RIGHT SIDE. SHE ALSO FELT CHEST PAIN DURING THIS PERIOD. THE PT SAW HER PHYSICIAN WHO INFORMED HER THAT IT WAS LIKELY AN ""INTERNAL STITCH SHE FELT, AND IT WAS NOT UNUSUAL FOR WEEPING TO OCCUR AT SUTURE SITE."" THERE WAS NO TREATMENT GIVEN THE PT AT THAT TIME. FROM THAT TIME UNTIL (B)(6) 2014 THE PT STILL DID NOT FEEL VERY WELL.

HER TEMPERATURE WAS 103. SHE ""WENT UNCONSCIOUS BUT WAS RESPONSIVE"" AND HER HUSBAND CALLED 911. WHEN THE EMTS ARRIVED THEREAFTER, SHE HAD NO PULSE. IN THE ER, HER BP WAS 60/12. ""SHE WAS ON A VENTILATOR AND IN THE ICU IMMEDIATELY, ON STEROIDS, PRESSORS, AND IN AN INDUCED COMA FOR 4-5 DAYS. HER RIGHT BREAST WAS SO STRETCHED FROM SWELLING WITH INFECTION THAT YOU COULD SEE CLEAR FLUID WEEPING FROM IT. THERE WAS MUCH CLEAR FLUID FROM THE MASTECTOMY. SHE WAS ON DIALYSIS. SHE ACTUALLY STARTED TO IMPROVE AFTER SHE WAS EXPLANTED. THE SWELLING DECREASED, MEDS WERE BEING WEANED, BUT HER SKIN WAS SLOUGHING. HER FINGERTIPS, HER FEET WERE TURNING BLACK.""

SILICONE PT BROCHURE: FOLLOWING BREAST AUGMENTATION, YOU SHOULD CONTINUE TO PERFORM BREAST SELF-EXAMINATION MONTHLY. THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH A BREAST IMPLANT IN PLACE. TO CONTINUE TO PERFORM A MONTHLY BREAST SELF EXAMINATION EFFICIENTLY, YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU IDENTIFY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLANT AND YOUR BREAST TISSUE. BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE IMPLANT FROM BREAST TISSUE WILL DECREASE THE NECESSITY OF EXCESSIVE SQUEEZING OF THE IMPLANT DURING EXAMINATION. ANY NEW LUMPS SHOULD BE EVALUATED WITH A BIOPSY, AS APPROPRIATE.

4702227|13234344|N|1||(B)(4). DEVICE LABELING: BASED ON INFORMATION TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGAN'S AND OTHER MANUFACTURER'S BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. THERE WERE 9 PRIMARY AUGMENTATION PATIENTS (1.9%) WITH A NEW DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER THROUGH 10 YEARS IN THE ALLERGAN PIVOTAL STUDY. IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION PATIENTS, THERE WAS 1 REPORT OF SKIN CANCER AND 1 REPORT OF RENAL CELL CANCER, AND 1 PRIMARY AUGMENTATION PATIENT WHO WAS PREGNANT AT THE TIME OF IMPLANTATION GAVE BIRTH TO A CHILD WHO LATER DEVELOPED HISTIOCYTOSIS. THERE WAS 1 REVISION-AUGMENTATION PATIENT (0.8%) WITH A NEW DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER THROUGH 10 YEARS AND 1 PATIENT REPORT OF BLADDER CANCER AND 1 PATIENT REPORT OF MULTIPLE MYELOMA. THERE WERE 17 RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS (7.6%) WITH RECURRENCE OF BREAST CANCER THROUGH 10 YEARS, 1 REPORT OF NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA AND 1 REPORT OF UTERINE CANCER. THERE WERE NO REVISION-RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS WHO REPORTED A RECURRENCE OF BREAST CANCER THROUGH 10 YEARS AND NO REPORTS OF OTHER CANCERS IN REVISION-RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. ONE RECONSTRUCTION PATIENT IN THE PIVOTAL STUDY WAS REPORTED WITH ALCL THROUGH 10 YEARS. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. LITERATURE REPORTS HAVE ALSO BEEN MADE ASSOCIATING SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS WITH VARIOUS RHEUMATOLOGICAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS SUCH AS FATIGUE, EXHAUSTION, JOINT PAIN AND SWELLING, MUSCLE PAIN AND CRAMPING, TINGLING, NUMBNESS, WEAKNESS, AND SKIN RASHES.|STYLE 410 COHESIVE SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|MF-410335|04/16/2015||02/25/2013|DA|Y|Y||0HP|FTR|1.0|02/02/2011|nan||1223847|||ARKLOW, COUNTY WICKLOW|EI|ALLERGAN|||||||True
5039249|24514426|D|1||"I HAD BREAST AUGMENTATION IN 2007. MY IMPLANTS ARE THE GUMMY BEAR, SILICONE, UNDER THE MUSCLE. I REALLY HADN'T BEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO ANY CERTAIN SYMPTOM UNTIL IN EARLY (B)(6) 2014, I WAS EXERCISING AND NOTICED A SEVERE PAIN IN MY RIGHT CALF MUSCLE. I THOUGHT I HAD TORN MY CALF BUT AFTER A WEEK IT WENT AWAY. AS I CONTINUED TO EXERCISE I NOTICED EXTREME FATIGUE IN MY MUSCLES AND REALIZED THAT I COULD NOT LIFT MY RIGHT FOOT. SEARCHING THE INTERNET I REALIZED I HAD FOOT DROP. AT THE SAME TIME I HAD STARTED NOTICING MY MUSCLES TWITCHING. I AM AN INTERNET RESEARCHER AND WHAT I WAS FINDING WAS INCREDIBLY SCARY. IN ADDITION, MY RIGHT BREAST HAD AN EPISODE OF SWELLING AND PAIN. I SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT FOR THE BREAST. THEY DID ULTRASOUND, MAMMO, AND THEN MRI. FINDING FLUID UNDER THE IMPLANT THEY SCHEDULED A BIOPSY AND MENTIONED ALCL. DURING THE APPOINTMENT FOR THE BIOPSY THE DOC COULD NOT FIND ENOUGH FLUID TO BIOPSY AND BECAUSE THE PAIN WAS GONE HE ABORTED THE PROCEDURE. FAST FORWARD TO (B)(6) 2014, I SAW A GP FOR THE MUSCLE CRAMPS AND FOOT DROP, SHE REFERRED ME TO A NEUROLOGIST. I ASKED ALL DOCTORS IF MY IMPLANTS COULD BE (THE RADIOLOGIST FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF RUPTURE) RELATED AT ALL - ALL SAID ""OH, BUT I'M NO EXPERT."" NEUROLOGIST #1 DID A COUPLE OF TESTS OF MY BLOOD (FOR COPPER) AND AN EMG. SAID I DEFINITELY HAD WEAKNESS AND UNEXPLAINED FOOT DROP SO I ""PROBABLY HAVE ALS"", SO MY WORLD HAS COME CRASHING DOWN. WE GOT A SECOND OPINION FROM A NEUROLOGIST THAT SPECIALIZES IN ALS. UPON FIRST MEETING HE SAID IT COULD BE SO MANY THINGS. ORDERED ANOTHER EMG. THAT DOC SAID THE TEST RESULTS DID NOT SEEM CONSISTENT WITH ALS BUT BECAUSE THERE IS NO TEST FOR ALS IT WOULD BE A WAIT AND SEE SITUATION. ABOUT (B)(6) IN BLOOD TESTS LATER FOR ANY ALS MARKERS OR ANYTHING ELSE, NO CONCLUSION. ANOTHER EMG WAS DONE AT THE ""SPECIALIST'S OFFICE"" AND ONE TECH SAID SOME PARTS OF ME TESTED BETTER THAN LAST TIME AND THEN SOME AREAS LOOKED THE SAME OR ""MAYBE SLIGHTLY WORSE."" AT THIS POINT I HAD STOPPED FOCUSING ON MY BREAST BUT THE RIGHT SIDE STILL DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT. IT IS SLIGHTLY MORE RIGID. I CAN FEEL RIPPLES IN THE IMPLANT, MY NECK APPEARS SLIGHTLY SWOLLEN ON THE RIGHT. SEARCHING BACK THE LAST 8 YEARS I STARTED REALIZING THAT MY MUSCLE WEAKNESSES PROBABLY BEGAN 3-4 YEARS AGO, THE CRAMPS AT LEAST 3-4 YEARS. I'VE STRUGGLED WITH MILD FACIAL BREAK OUTS, SMELLING URINE, MORE EXTREME SYMPTOMS DURING CERTAIN DAYS OF THE MONTH, TONGUE SWELLING, ANXIETY, FATIGUE, ETC. NOT WILLING TO SIT AROUND AND DO NOTHING I AM SEEING A NATUROPATH. HE SAYS MY LYME TEST CAME BACK WITH A 50/50 CHANCE OF ME HAVING LYME. MY B12 IS LOW, MY TESTOSTERONE LEVELS ARE BARELY EXISTENT, AND ONE OTHER MICRONUTRIENT WAS LOW. I'VE SHARED ALL THIS WITH MY NEUROLOGIST AND HE SAYS THAT NONE OF THIS MEANS ANYTHING. I AM GETTING SLIGHTLY WEAKER. I WALK WITH A LIMP DUE TO THE FOOT DROP, JOINT PAIN AND BACK PAIN COME AND GO. FOOT DROP AND MUSCLE TWITCHES REMAIN. MY GUT SAYS ITS THE IMPLANTS AND I KNOW THERE IS NO TEST TO DO FOR A DEFINITIVE ANSWER. ON (B)(6) 2015 I WENT IN FOR EXPLANT. IT WAS FOUND THAT MY RIGHT IMPLANT WAS RUPTURED AND THE SILICONE HAD SPILLED OUT INTO MY TISSUES. THE DOCTOR PERFORMED AN EN BLOC CAPSULECTOMY AND REPLACED THE IMPLANTS WITH MENTOR SALINE IMPLANTS. I AM 1.5 POST EXPLANT AND I NOTICE SOME MILD CHANGES, IMPROVEMENTS. HOWEVER, MUSCLE TWITCHES AND FOOT DROP REMAIN. I HAVE FOUND A (B)(6) GROUP WITH OVER 300 WOMEN THAT ARE EXTREMELY ILL FROM THEIR IMPLANTS AND TRYING TO GET HELP AND GET HEALTHY. I BELIEVE THAT I HAVE SOME SOFT OF SILICONE POISONING THAT IS NOT DETECTED BY MEDICAL TESTS. I AM IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO DO SMALL THINGS TO DETOX, EAT HEALTHY, INFRARED SAUNA, ETC.

PUBLISHED STUDIES INDICATE THAT BREAST CANCER IS NO MORE COMMON IN WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS THAN THOSE WITHOUT IMPLANTS. A LARGE, LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP FOUND NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE RISK RATES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CANCERS, INCLUDING STOMACH CANCER, LEUKEMIA, AND LYMPHOMA. PTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. CALCIUM DEPOSITS CAN FORM IN THE TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT WITH SYMPTOMS THAT MAY INCLUDE PAIN AND FIRMNESS. LYMPHADENOPATHY HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED IN SOME WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS.

USE CARE IN SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURES SUCH AS OPEN CAPSULOTOMY, BREAST POCKET REVISION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA ASPIRATION, AND BIOPSY/LUMPECTOMY TO AVOID DAMAGE TO THE IMPLANT. PT SHOULD PERFORM BREAST SELF-EXAMINATIONS MONTHLY AND BE SHOWN HOW TO DISTINGUISH THE IMPLANT FROM THEIR BREAST TISSUE. THE PT SHOULD NOT MANIPULATE OR SQUEEZE THE EXCESSIVELY. THE PT SHOULD BE TOLD THAT THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGE IN THE IMPLANT SHAPE MAY BE SIGNS OF SYMPTOMATIC RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. IF THE PT HAS ANY OF THESE SIGNS, SHE SHOULD BE TOLD TO REPORT THEM, AND POSSIBLY HAVE AN MRI EVAL TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. THE NATRELLE CORE STUDY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE LONG-TERM (10 YEARS) SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PROD.

5221831|31193114|D|1||IN 2004, I RECEIVED A BREAST AUGMENTATION PROCEDURE. THE IMPLANTS I HAD PUT IN WERE FILLED WITH SALINE. A FEW YEARS WENT BY WITH NO INCIDENT OR ISSUE, HOWEVER THIS WAS A SHORT LIVED BLISS. AFTER ABOUT THE FIFTH YEAR OF HAVING THE IMPLANTS, I BEGAN HAVING SYMPTOMS OF BACK PAIN, FATIGUE, AND A BURNING SENSATION IN MY CHEST WALL. NOT LONG AFTER THESE SYMPTOMS STARTED, SOON MORE SYMPTOMS BEGAN TO DEVELOP SUCH AS: LOW GRADE FEVERS THAT WERE ACCOMPANIED BY SHOOTING/BURNING PAINS THAT CONSUMED MY ENTIRE BODY. AFTER SEEING MY GENERAL PHYSICIAN FOR THESE ISSUES, HE DIAGNOSED WITH FIBROMYALGIA AFTER MANY EVALUATIONS FOLLOWING. THIS CAME AS A SHOCK TO ME AND ALL OF MY FAMILY. THE MEDICINES USED TO TREAT AND ALLEVIATE FIBROMYALGIA SYMPTOMS BROUGHT ABOUT SIDE EFFECTS THAT WERE LESS THAN DESIRABLE MEDICINES AS THEY DID NOT HELP ME WHATSOEVER AND ONLY WORSENED MY WELL BEING. THE THREE OR SO YEARS THAT FOLLOWED AFTER THE FIBROMYALGIA DIAGNOSIS WERE A CONSTANT BATTLE OF CHRONIC FATIGUE, LOW GRADE FEVERS, BURNING/SHOOTING PAINS, MILD DEPRESSION, AND FLU LIKE SYMPTOMS. IN THE PAST YEAR, I HAVE BEEN MOSTLY BED RIDDEN AND CHRONICALLY ILL, NOT ABLE TO HAVE A NORMAL FUNCTIONING LIFE, AND DEALING WITH THE ABOVE STATED SYMPTOMS THAT HAVE WORSENED. ALL ALONG THESE MANY YEARS OF DEALING WITH SYMPTOMS UNK AS TO WHY THEY WERE OCCURRING, THEN BEING THOUGHT TO HAVE FIBROMYALGIA, DIVINE INTERVENTION LED ME TO DIG DEEPER INTO MY EXISTING CONDITION, AS I COULD NOT AND WOULD NOT ACCEPT THIS HEALTH DETERIORATION AS WHAT I WILL FACE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. TO PREFACE THIS PAT ABOUT MY FINDINGS AND WHAT FOLLOWED, I'LL BRIEFLY EXPLAIN HOW THIS CAME ABOUT. HERE AND THERE THROUGHOUT THESE MANY YEARS, I SPECULATED THAT THE CULPRIT BEHIND MY HEALTH PROBLEMS COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN STEMMING FROM MY BREAST IMPLANTS, BUT AFTER CONSULTING THE COSMETIC SURGEON WHO PERFORMED BY BREAST AUGMENTATION, AND OTHER VARIOUS PHYSICIANS, I WAS CONVINCED BY THESE PRACTITIONERS THAT MY BREAST IMPLANTS WERE MOST DEFINITELY NOT THE CAUSE OF MY HEALTH ISSUES. NATURALLY, IT IS ANYONE'S INCLINATION TO TRUST WHAT DOCTORS TELL US, AND THEREFORE I DID JUST THAT. NOT BEING ABLE TO LET GO OF THE PRESSING THOUGHT THAT MY BREAST IMPLANTS JUST MIGHT BE THE ROOT TO ALL OF MY SUFFERING, I BEGAN PUTTING ALL OF MY EXPENDABLE ENERGY INTO RIGOROUS RESEARCH REGARDING BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESSES. IT DID NOT TAKE ME VERY LONG TO CONCLUDE THAT MY SUSPICIONS OF MY BREAST IMPLANTS WERE INDEED THE ROOT CAUSE OF ALL OF MY MANY YEARS OF PAIN AND SUFFERING. I QUICKLY LEARNED ABOUT A DOCTOR OUT OF (B)(6) WHO SPECIALIZES AND ADVOCATES IN BREAST IMPLANT DISEASES AND BREAST IMPLANT REMOVALS. I THEN STARTED A REGULAR CORRESPONDENCE WITH THIS DOCTOR AND SET AN APPOINTMENT TO HAVE MY IMPLANTS REMOVED. PRIOR TO MY REMOVAL SURGERY, MY BLOOD LABORATORY RESULTS SHOWED THE PRESENCE OF MYCOPLASMA PNEUMONIA. THIS ALARMED ME AS I LEARNED THE NATURE OF THIS HARMFUL MICROORGANISM THAT INVADED BY BODY AS A RESULT OF TAINTED IMPLANTS AND A SUPPRESSED IMMUNITY. IT TURNS OUT THAT FOR YEARS, MY BODY WAS FIGHTING A SILENT BATTLE THAT EVENTUALLY BEGAN SHOWING ITS FACE WITH THE ONSET OF MY INITIAL SYMPTOMS YEARS EARLIER. ALL OF THE YEARS THAT WENT BY WITH LITTLE TO NO ANSWERS OR REPUTABLE TREATMENTS, THE MYCOPLASMA WAS WREAKING HAVOC WITHIN MY BODY AND TERRIBLY STRESSING MY IMMUNE SYSTEM. WHEN MY BREAST IMPLANT REMOVAL SURGERY DAY CAME ABOUT, MY SURGEON WAS NOT SURPRISED TO SEE THAT MY BREAST TISSUES SURROUNDING THE IMPLANTS WERE BADLY INFECTED AND GROWING MOLD AND FUNGUS. FIVE INFECTED LYMPH NODES WERE REMOVED THAT WERE LOCATED NEAR THE BREAST, ALONG WITH THE INFECTED TISSUES, AND OF COURSE THE IMPLANTS THEMSELVES. MY SURGEON WHO PERFORMED THE REMOVAL, ALSO EXPLAINED THAT THE MYCOPLASMA PNEUMONIA WAS RESIDING WITHIN ANY AND ALL REGIONS OF BY BODY INCLUDING MAJOR INTERNAL ORGANS.|SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS||11/09/2015||||*|*||0LP|FWM|1.0||SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS||475 CC|||||MENTOR|||||5530938||True

5222818|31178939|N|1||(B)(4). DEVICE LABELING: BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. IN THE PASS STUDY, AT LEAST 1 REOPERATION WAS PERFORMED ON 315 PATIENTS (36.5%) THROUGH 10 YEARS. A TOTAL OF 424 REOPERATIONS WERE PERFORMED. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR REOPERATION THROUGH 10 YEARS ON AUGMENTATION PATIENTS WAS IMPLANT DEFLATION AT 21.7%. THE PERCENTAGE OF REOPERATIONS DUE TO LUMP/MASS/CYST INCREASED FROM 8.5% OF 293 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 5 YEARS TO 13.9% OF 424 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 10 YEARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF LUMPS, MASSES, AND CYSTS CAN BE EXPECTED TO NATURALLY INCREASE AS PATIENTS AGE AND COULD BE AN EXPLANATION FOR THE INCREASE. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, ASYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. OF THE 237 PATIENTS IN THE R95 STUDY, AT LEAST 1 REOPERATION WAS PERFORMED ON 99 PATIENTS (42%) FOR A TOTAL OF 125 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 5 YEARS. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR REOPERATION THROUGH 5 YEARS WAS CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE AT 25.6%. OF THE 237 RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS IN R95, THERE WERE 62 PATIENTS (26.2%) WHO HAD 70 IMPLANTS REMOVED THROUGH 5 YEARS. OF THE 70 RECONSTRUCTION IMPLANTS REMOVED THROUGH 5 YEARS, 70% WERE REPLACED. THE MOST COMMON REASON FOR IMPLANT REMOVAL WAS CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE (31.4%). THROUGH 10 YEARS, THERE WERE 104 IMPLANTS REMOVED FROM 85 PATIENTS. THE MOST COMMON REASON FOR IMPLANT REMOVAL WAS IMPLANT LEAKAGE/DEFLATION (32.7%).|STYLE 363 SALINE FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|363LF-410|11/13/2015||||N|R||0HP|FWM|1.0|10/09/2005|PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||569053|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

CALCIUM DEPOSITS CAN FORM IN THE TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT WITH SYMPTOMS THAT MAY INCLUDE PAIN AND FIRMNESS. LYMPHADENOPATHY HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED IN SOME WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS. THE NATRELLE CORE STUDY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE LONG-TERM (10 YEARS) SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, ALLERGAN HAS INITIATED A SEPARATE LARGE 10-YEAR POST-APPROVAL STUDY (THE BREAST IMPLANT FOLLOW-UP STUDIES, OR BIFS) TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC ISSUES WHICH ALLERGAN'S CORE STUDY WAS NOT DESIGNED TO FULLY ANSWER, AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE A REAL-WORLD ASSESSMENT OF SOME ENDPOINTS. THE ENDPOINTS IN THE BIFS LARGE POST-APPROVAL STUDY INCLUDE LONG-TERM LOCAL COMPLICATIONS, CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE (CTD), CTD SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS, NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE, NEUROLOGICAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS, OFFSPRING ISSUES, REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES, LACTATION ISSUES, CANCER, SUICIDE, MAMMOGRAPHY ISSUES, AND MRI COMPLIANCE AND RESULTS. ALLERGAN WILL UPDATE THEIR LABELING ON A REGULAR BASIS WITH THE RESULTS OF THESE TWO STUDIES. THERE WAS 1 PRIMARY AUGMENTATION PATIENT WITH A NEW DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER THROUGH 7 YEARS IN THE CORE STUDY. THERE WAS A 13% BENIGN BREAST DISEASE RATE AND A 1% MALIGNANT BREAST DISEASE RATE. FOR REVISION-AUGMENTATION PATIENTS, THERE WAS 1 PATIENT WITH A NEW DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER. THERE WAS A 15% BENIGN BREAST DISEASE RATE AND A 1% MALIGNANT BREAST DISEASE RATE THROUGH 7 YEARS.

5801921|49945348|D|1||"I HAD BREAST AUGMENTATION IN 1998 BY A (B)(6) PLASTIC SURGEON. WITHIN 2 YEARS, I DEVELOPED HASHIMOTO'S AUTOIMMUNE THYROIDITIS. OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, I DEVELOPED CHRONIC FATIGUE, CHRONIC EPSTEIN-BARR, RECURRENT LOW GRADE FEVER, SWOLLEN LYMPH NODES, BRAIN FOG, SKIN NODULES, CHRONIC SINUS INFECTIONS. I WENT FROM DOCTOR TO DOCTOR ABOUT DIFFERENT ISSUES WITHOUT RECEIVING MUCH EXPLANATION FOR MY SYMPTOMS. IN 2012, ONE OF MY SALINE IMPLANTS RUPTURED. I WAS NOT IN A POSITION FINANCIALLY TO REPLACE THEM. I CONTACTED MY ORIGINAL PLASTIC SURGEON IN (B)(64). MY RECORDS HAD BEEN DESTROYED. HE MENTIONED TWO BRANDS OF IMPLANTS THAT HE WAS USING IN 1998. AFTER MY RUPTURE, I SLOWLY DEVELOPED MIGRAINES 1-3 DAYS A WEEK AND ARM AND HAND NUMBNESS. MY FATIGUE WORSENED. MY CONCENTRATION WAS BAD. A FEW MONTHS AFTER THE RUPTURE, I FOUND ONE OF MY ID CARDS, I WAS APPALLED TO FIND OUT THAT I HAD PIP BRAND TEXTURED SALINE IMPLANTS. THIS WAS NOT ONE OF THE BRANDS THAT MY SURGEON MENTIONED ON THE PHONE. THEN I FOUND OUT THAT THE FDA HAD DENIED THEIR APPROVAL IN 2000. I WAS NEVER NOTIFIED BY MY SURGEON OR THE FDA THAT MY IMPLANTS HAD BEEN DENIED APPROVAL. I HAD TO LEAVE MY RUPTURED IMPLANT IN FOR 3 YEARS BEFORE I COULD REMOVE THEM. DURING THAT TIME, I WAS CONSIDERING ALL OF MY OPTIONS. I FOUND A PLASTIC SURGEON IN DALLAS WHO DOES NOT PERFORM BREAST AUGMENTATION BECAUSE HE HAS SEEN SO MANY WOMEN WHO DEVELOPED ILLNESS FROM THEIR BREAST IMPLANTS. HIS LIST OF COMMON SYMPTOMS WENT RIGHT ALONG WITH MY LIST. I FINALLY REMOVED BOTH BREAST IMPLANTS IN (B)(6) 2015. MANY OF MY SYMPTOMS IMMEDIATELY DISAPPEARED. MY LOW GRADE FEVER, ARM AND HAND NUMBNESS, SWOLLEN LYMPH NODES, MIGRAINES, AND BRAIN FOG WENT AWAY IMMEDIATELY AFTER SURGERY. I STILL HAVE HASHIMOTO'S AND I STILL BATTLE FATIGUE. OVERALL, THOUGH, MY HEALTH IS GREATLY IMPROVED. I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT MY IMPLANTS CONTRIBUTED TO MY DECLINING HEALTH. I SENT MY IMPLANTS TO DR. (B)(6) FOR EVAL. THE TEXTURED SURFACE SHOWED MAJOR EROSION AND MY RUPTURED IMPLANT WAS FULL OF CONTAMINANTS. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE PROCESS OF ALLOWING THESE PIP IMPLANTS INTO THE US FOR USE, WHY THE FDA DENIED THEIR APPROVAL, THE REASON THAT I WAS NOT NOTIFIED, AND HOW I CAN OBTAIN THE CHEMICAL MAKEUP OF THESE SALINE PIP IMPLANTS. IT IS WIDELY KNOWN THAT THE SILICONE PIP IMPLANTS USED INTERNATIONALLY WERE MADE WITH INDUSTRIAL GRADE SILICONE AND THEY HAD A HIGH RATE OF RUPTURE. I HAVE MET THOUSANDS OF WOMEN WHO ARE IN THE SAME SITUATION AS ME. THEY TOO HAVE DEVELOPED AUTOIMMUNE ILLNESS AND STRANGE SYMPTOMS AFTER AUGMENTATION. I AM IN NUMEROUS SUPPORT GROUPS FOR THESE WOMEN. I SPEAK OUT PUBLICLY ABOUT IT AND I WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. WE HAVE AN UPCOMING (B)(6) CONFERENCE ON BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESS TO DISCUSS THIS VERY ISSUE. LONG-TERM STUDIES NEED TO BE DONE (15-20 YEAR STUDIES) AND THEY NEED TO BE FOUND BY SOMEONE OTHER THAN THE IMPLANT MFRS. I HAVE MET WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN SUSPICIOUSLY DROPPED FROM THE STUDIES THEY WERE IN. I HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING PUBLICATIONS, MEDICAL JOURNALS, RADIOLOGICAL JOURNALS, ETC., FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS. IT IS APPALLING TO READ SOME OF THESE ARTICLES AND STILL SEE THAT THE FDA LABELS THESE AS SAFE. THE MENTOR MEMORYGEL PHYSICIAN'S LABELING PAMPHLET THAT IS ON THE FDA WEBSITE STATES THAT THE STUDIES INVOLVING A RELATION TO CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDER NEEDS TO BE LARGER (NOT THAT THERE ISN'T A CONNECTION), THAT THE STUDIES INVOLVING NEUROLOGICAL SYMPTOMS ARE INSUFFICIENT OR FLAWED (NOT THAT THERE ISN'T A CONNECTION), AND THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN SYMPTOMS SUCH AS CHRONIC FATIGUE, JOINT PAIN, FIBROMYALGIA, ETC., EVEN WHEN THE IMPLANTS AREN'T DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO A ""DEFINED ILLNESS"". THIS IS THE PAMPHLET FROM THE IMPLANT MFR YET MANY WOMEN SAY THAT THEY WERE NEVER TOLD OF THESE POSSIBLE RISKS. THE SAME PAMPHLET SAYS THAT SILICONE AND PLATINUM CAN MIGRATE THROUGH THE SEMI-PERMEABLE INTACT SHELL YET WE CAN'T GET A LIST OF INGREDIENTS.

PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE.

CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER THESE ADDITIONAL SURGERIES. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF DEFLATION.""

THAT THERE WAS MORE THAN 25 YEARS OF RESEARCH TO BACK UP. THE EVIDENCE OF SAFETY. IN NO WAY WAS I TOLD THAT I WAS AN ACTUAL ""STUDY"" ON THE SAFETY OF THE PRODUCT. IMPLANTS WERE ALREADY SUPPOSED TO BE SAFE. I WAS LED TO BELIEVE THAT THE TRACKING OF BIFS WAS FOR PTS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS REGARDING SURGERY, IMPLANTS PERFORMANCE OF DEVICE. BASICALLY, SO THE ALLERGAN COMPANY COULD ACCOUNT FOR ALL DEVICE IMPLANTS. NEVER WAS TOLD THAT I WAS A TEST SUBJECT FOR THE SAFETY OF AN PULLED DEVICE THAT WAS LATER RE-INTRODUCED INTO THE MARKET AS A SAFE PRODUCT. IF I WOULD HAVE KNOWN THIS AHEAD OF TIME, (PRODUCT WAS NOT TESTED, NOT SAFE) THESE COMPANIES WERE TOLD TO SUPPLY SATISFACTORY EVIDENCE OF SAFETY OF THEIR OWN PRODUCT THAT THEY HAD IMPLANTED INTO MANY THOUSANDS OF WOMEN AND TOLD TO MONITOR THEM FOR 10 YEARS IS AN AFFECTIVE WAY TO TELL IF A PRODUCT IS SAFE OR NOT. I WAS MISINFORMED AND MISLEAD, BETWEEN THE SURGEON WHO WANTS TO MAKE MONEY, THE COMPANY'S WHO MAKE THE PROFITS ARE NOT GOING TO SAY, THEY ARE NOT SAFE! THAT THEY DIDN'T DO ENOUGH RESEARCH INTO THE NEW SILICONE PRODUCT BEFORE IT HIT THE MARKET THAT THERE ARE POTENTIALLY SERIOUS HEALTH RISKS LATER DOWN THE ROAD INCLUDING THOSE WHICH I COMPLAINED ABOUT.
