DEFLATION Â¿ BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS DEFLATE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. DEFLATION CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO DEFLATE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS; FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL; EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED); TRAUMA; COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING; AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE.

CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE.

POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. BREAST IMPLANTS RUPTURE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. RUPTURES CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO RUPTURE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, STRESSING THE IMPLANT DURING IMPLANTATION AND WEAKENING IT, FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL, EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED), TRAUMA, COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING, AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF RUPTURE FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT. IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF RUPTURE. LABORATORY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RUPTURE ARE ONGOING. SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SEE TABLE 3 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING MRI SCREENING. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE. IF RUPTURE OCCURS, SILICONE GEL MAY EITHER REMAIN WITHIN THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), MOVE OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE (EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), OR MOVE OUTSIDE THE BREAST (GEL MIGRATION). THERE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY THAT RUPTURE MAY PROGRESS FROM INTRACAPSULAR TO EXTRACAPSULAR AND BEYOND. IN ALLERGANÂ¿S CORE STUDY, THERE WAS A MRI SCREENING COHORT WHO HAD REGULAR MRIS TO SCREEN FOR BREAST IMPLANT RUPTURE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE SYMPTOMATIC (I.E., MRI COHORT) AND A NON-MRI SCREENING COHORT WHO WERE NOT SCREENED WITH BREAST IMPLANT MRIS (I.E., NON-MRI COHORT). THE RUPTURE RATES IN THE MRI COHORTS WERE 9.3% FOR PRIMARY AUGMENTATION, 5.4% FOR REVISION-AUGMENTATION, 35.4% FOR PRIMARY RECONSTRUCTION, AND 0% FOR REVISION-RECONSTRUCTION. THE RUPTURE RATE FOR THE WHOLE MRI COHORT IN THE CORE STUDY (INCLUDING AUGMENTATION, REVISION-AUGMENTATION, RECONSTRUCTION, AND REVISION-RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS) THROUGH 10 YEARS WAS 13.0% FOR PATIENTS AND 7.7% FOR IMPLANTS. ACROSS ALL PATIENTS IN THE CORE STUDY, ALL RUPTURES WERE INTRACAPSULAR WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 3 CASES OF EXTRACAPSULAR GEL (ONE RUPTURE PROGRESSED TO EXTRACAPSULAR GEL FOLLOWING EXPLORATORY SURGERY TO CONFIRM THE RUPTURE AND THEN IMPLANT REPLACEMENT WAS DELAYED).|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|07/21/2017||||N|R||0HP|FWM|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||NI|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTER REGARDING EVENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REVIEW OF DHR FOR WORK ORDER 2579526 DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY DEVIATIONS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS OR NON-CONFORMANCES THAT MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE REPORTED DEVICE EVENT. ALL GEL BREAST IMPLANTS WERE REVIEWED AS PART OF THE ASSEMBLY OPERATIONS AND THESE TASKS WERE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO APPLICABLE CURRENT PROCEDURES TO ENSURE THAT ASSEMBLY MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. THE DHR ASSEMBLY REPORT FROM SAP WAS VERIFIED AND 1 DEVICE WAS SCRAPPED DURING THE ASSEMBLY PROCESS (PI) WHICH IS NOT RELATED TO THE REPORTED EVENT. HOWEVER THIS DHR ASSEMBLY REPORT FROM SAP WAS VERIFIED AND PRODUCT WAS RELEASED IN CONFORMANCE WITH THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. DHR FOR WORK ORDER 2579526 INDICATES THAT THERE WAS A REPROCESS IN THE PRIMARY PACKAGING OPERATION, HOWEVER THIS WAS COMPLETED ON A DIFFERENT SERIAL NUMBER AND THIS HAS NO RELATION NEITHER CAN CAUSE THE REPORTED EVENT. ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION GATHERED DURING THE DHR REVIEW, THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT DEVICES FROM WORK ORDER 2579526 WERE ASSEMBLED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALLERGAN MEDICAL PROCEDURES AND SPECIFICATIONS. THE REPORTED DEVICE WAS INTACT AT THE TIME OF PRODUCTION AND MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. DEVICE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: HEMATOMA/SEROMA. PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION.

DEVICE HISTORY RECORD REVIEW: REVIEW OF DHR FOR WORK ORDER 2183997 DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY DEVIATIONS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS OR NON-CONFORMANCES DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. ALL GEL BREAST IMPLANTS WERE REVIEWED AS PART OF THE ASSEMBLY OPERATIONS AND THESE TASKS WERE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO APPLICABLE CURRENT PROCEDURES TO ENSURE THAT ASSEMBLY MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. THE DHR ASSEMBLY REPORT FROM SAP WAS VERIFIED AND THERE WAS NO SCRAP RELATED WITH REPORTED EVENT, ALL DEVICES WERE CONFORMANCE DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION GATHERED DURING THE DHR REVIEW, THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT DEVICES FROM WORK ORDER 2183997 WERE ASSEMBLED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALLERGAN MEDICAL PROCEDURES AND SPECIFICATIONS. THE REPORTED DEVICE WAS INTACT AT THE TIME OF PRODUCTION AND MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. REPORTED EVENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN THE LABELING: PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENT. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. YOU SHOULD PERFORM SELF-EXAMINATION OF YOUR BREASTS EVERY MONTH FOR CANCER SCREENING. HOWEVER, THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU DISTINGUISH THE IMPLANT FROM YOUR BREAST TISSUE. THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGES IN IMPLANT SHAPE, MAY BE SIGNS OF A RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. THESE SIGNS SHOULD BE REPORTED TO YOUR SURGEON AND POSSIBLY EVALUATED WITH AN MRI. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.|INSPIRA TEXTURED SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|N-TRM445|05/10/2017||||N|R||0HP|FTR|1.0|10/11/2016|PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||2183997|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS PRESENT RESULTS FROM ALLERGANÂ¿S CORE CLINICAL STUDY CONDUCTED ON NATRELLE Â® SILICONE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANTS. ONE OF THE KEY COMPLICATIONS REPORTED IS CALLED Â¿CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE.Â¿ CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS A TIGHTENING OF THE SCAR TISSUE (ALSO CALLED A CAPSULE) THAT NORMALLY FORMS AROUND THE BREAST IMPLANT DURING THE HEALING PROCESS AFTER SURGERY. IN SOME WOMEN, THE SCAR TISSUE (CAPSULE) SQUEEZES THE IMPLANT. THIS RESULTS IN FIRMNESS OR HARDENING OF THE BREAST, AND IT IS A RISK FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE. DEGREES OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE ARE CLASSIFIED BY THE BAKER GRADING SCALE.1 CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BAKER GRADES III AND IV ARE THE MOST SEVERE. BAKER GRADE III OFTEN RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SURGERY (REOPERATION) BECAUSE OF PAIN AND POSSIBLY ABNORMAL APPEARANCE.

RUPTURE: BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. BREAST IMPLANTS RUPTURE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. RUPTURES CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO RUPTURE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, STRESSING THE IMPLANT DURING IMPLANTATION AND WEAKENING IT, FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL, EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED), TRAUMA, COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING, AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF RUPTURE FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT. IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF RUPTURE. LABORATORY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RUPTURE ARE ONGOING. SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE. IF RUPTURE OCCURS, SILICONE GEL MAY EITHER REMAIN WITHIN THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), MOVE OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE (EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), OR MOVE OUTSIDE THE BREAST (GEL MIGRATION). THERE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY THAT RUPTURE MAY PROGRESS FROM INTRACAPSULAR TO EXTRACAPSULAR AND BEYOND. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE: PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION|INSPIRA SMOOTH SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|N-SSM275|01/25/2017||02/17/2017|DA|R|Y||0HP|FTR|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||2690610|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

DEVICE LABELING ADDRESSES: ""BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY.

SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT.

CANCER PUBLISHED STUDIES INDICATE THAT BREAST CANCER IS NO MORE COMMON IN WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS THAN THOSE WITHOUT IMPLANTS. A LARGE, LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP FOUND NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE RISK RATES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CANCERS, INCLUDING STOMACH CANCER, LEUKEMIA, AND LYMPHOMA. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.

MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SEE TABLE 3 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING MRI SCREENING. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE.

PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE.

CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. ONE OF THE KEY COMPLICATIONS REPORTED IS CALLED Â¿CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS A TIGHTENING OF THE SCAR TISSUE (ALSO CALLED A CAPSULE) THAT NORMALLY FORMS AROUND THE BREAST IMPLANT DURING THE HEALING PROCESS AFTER SURGERY. IN SOME WOMEN, THE SCAR TISSUE (CAPSULE) SQUEEZES THE IMPLANT. THIS RESULTS IN FIRMNESS OR HARDENING OF THE BREAST, AND IT IS A RISK FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE.

FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTER REGARDING EVENT, PRODUCT, OR PATIENT DETAILS HAS BEEN REQUESTED. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. DEVICE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, ASYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER THESE ADDITIONAL SURGERIES. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF DEFLATION. PAIN OF VARYING INTENSITY AND LENGTH OF TIME MAY OCCUR AND PERSIST FOLLOWING BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY. IN ADDITION, IMPROPER SIZE, PLACEMENT, SURGICAL TECHNIQUE, OR CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY RESULT IN PAIN. PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED TO CONTACT THEIR SURGEON IF THERE IS SIGNIFICANT PAIN OR IF PAIN PERSISTS. UNSATISFACTORY RESULTS Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE INFORMED THAT DISSATISFACTION WITH COSMETIC RESULTS RELATED TO SUCH THINGS AS SCAR DEFORMITY, HYPERTROPHIC SCARRING, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, INCORRECT SIZE, AND IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY MAY OCCUR. CAREFUL SURGICAL PLANNING AND TECHNIQUE CAN MINIMIZE, BUT NOT PRECLUDE, THE RISK OF SUCH RESULTS. PRE-EXISTING ASYMMETRY MAY NOT BE ENTIRELY CORRECTABLE.

THE REPORTED EVENT IS A PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATION AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THIS EVENT. REPORTED EVENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN THE LABELING: ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM.

GLOSSARY: RUPTURE - A HOLE OR TEAR IN THE SHELL OF THE IMPLANT THAT ALLOWS SILICONE GEL FILLER MATERIAL TO LEAK FROM THE SHELL. RUPTURES CAN BE INTRACAPSULAR (INSIDE THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT) OR EXTRACAPSULAR (OUTSIDE THE SCAR TISSUE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT). WARNINGS: RUPTURE OF A SILICONE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT IS MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR SURGEON WILL KNOW THAT YOUR IMPLANTS HAVE A RUPTURE. THEREFORE YOU WILL NEED REGULAR MRI SCREENINGS OVER YOUR LIFETIME IN ORDER TO DETERMINE IF RUPTURE IS PRESENT. YOU SHOULD HAVE AN MRI 3 YEARS AFTER YOUR BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY AND THEN EVERY 2 YEARS AFTER THAT FOR AS LONG AS YOU HAVE YOUR BREAST IMPLANTS. IF IMPLANT RUPTURE IS NOTED ON AN MRI, YOU SHOULD HAVE THE IMPLANT REMOVED, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT.|UNK GEL BREAST IMPLANT|UNK GEL BREAST IMPLANT|07/27/2017||07/04/2017||R|Y||0HP|FTR|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||NI|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

DEVICE LABELING ADDRESSES: BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM.

DEVICE LABELING: BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.

LITERATURE REPORTS HAVE ALSO BEEN MADE ASSOCIATING SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS WITH VARIOUS RHEUMATOLOGICAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS SUCH AS SKIN RASHES POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION.|UNK GEL BREAST IMPLANT|UNK GEL BREAST IMPLANT|05/23/2017||||N|R||0HP|FTR|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||NI|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY.|INSPIRA SMOOTH SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|SSF370|02/10/2017||||N|R||0HP|FTR|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||NI|KILBRIDE INDUSTRIAL ESTATE||ARKLOW, COUNTY WICKLOW||ALLERGAN (ARKLOW)|||||||True

SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS DEFLATE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. DEFLATION CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO DEFLATE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS; FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL; EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED); TRAUMA; COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING; AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF DEFLATION FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT; HOWEVER, IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF DEFLATION.Â¿ Â¿CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER THESE ADDITIONAL SURGERIES.

CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER THESE ADDITIONAL SURGERIES. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF DEFLATION. PAIN OF VARYING INTENSITY AND LENGTH OF TIME MAY OCCUR AND PERSIST FOLLOWING BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY.

SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL.

THE REPORTED EVENTS ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THESE EVENTS. REVIEW OF DHR (DEVICE HISTORY RECORD) FOR WORK ORDER (B)(4) DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY DEVIATIONS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS OR NON-CONFORMANCES DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. ALL GEL BREAST IMPLANTS WERE REVIEWED AS PART OF THE ASSEMBLY OPERATIONS AND THESE TASKS WERE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO APPLICABLE CURRENT PROCEDURES TO ENSURE THAT ASSEMBLY MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. DHR FOR WORK ORDER (B)(4) INDICATES THAT THERE WAS A REPROCESS FOR TWO UNITS ON THE PRIMARY PACKAGING OPERATION, HOWEVER THIS WAS COMPLETED ON A DIFFERENT SERIAL NUMBER UNIT AND THIS HAS NO RELATION NEITHER CAN CAUSE THE REPORTED EVENT. THE DHR ASSEMBLY REPORT FROM ORACLE WAS VERIFIED AND THERE WAS NOT ANY SCRAP RELATED WITH REPORTED EVENT, ALL DEVICES WERE CONFORMANCE DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION GATHERED DURING THE DHR REVIEW, THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT DEVICES FROM WORK ORDER (B)(4) WERE ASSEMBLED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALLERGAN MEDICAL PROCEDURES AND SPECIFICATIONS. THE REPORTED DEVICE WAS INTACT AT THE TIME OF PRODUCTION AND MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. REPORTED EVENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN THE LABELING: ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. YOU SHOULD PERFORM SELF-EXAMINATION OF YOUR BREASTS EVERY MONTH FOR CANCER SCREENING. HOWEVER, THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU DISTINGUISH THE IMPLANT FROM YOUR BREAST TISSUE. THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGES IN IMPLANT SHAPE, MAY BE SIGNS OF A RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. THESE SIGNS SHOULD BE REPORTED TO YOUR SURGEON AND POSSIBLY EVALUATED WITH AN MRI. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.|INSPIRA TEXTURED SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|TRM310|05/04/2017||||N|R||0HP|FTR|1.0|09/14/2011|PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||1327562|KILBRIDE INDUSTRIAL ESTATE||ARKLOW, COUNTY WICKLOW||ALLERGAN (ARKLOW)|||||||True

THE PHYSICIAN ONLY CONFIRMED CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. THE EVENT OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS A PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATION AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THIS EVENT. FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTER REGARDING EVENT, PRODUCT, OR PATIENT DETAILS HAS BEEN REQUESTED. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. DEVICE LABELING: UNDERGOING ANY TYPE OF SURGERY INVOLVES RISKS. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF LOCAL COMPLICATIONS (PROBLEMS AT OR NEAR THE BREAST/SURGICAL INCISION SITE) THAT MAY OCCUR AFTER YOUR BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY. THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS PRESENT RESULTS FROM ALLERGANÂ¿S CORE CLINICAL STUDY CONDUCTED ON NATRELLE Â® SILICONE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANTS. ONE OF THE KEY COMPLICATIONS REPORTED IS CALLED Â¿CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE.Â¿ CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS A TIGHTENING OF THE SCAR TISSUE (ALSO CALLED A CAPSULE) THAT NORMALLY FORMS AROUND THE BREAST IMPLANT DURING THE HEALING PROCESS AFTER SURGERY. IN SOME WOMEN, THE SCAR TISSUE (CAPSULE) SQUEEZES THE IMPLANT. THIS RESULTS IN FIRMNESS OR HARDENING OF THE BREAST, AND IT IS A RISK FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE. DEGREES OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE ARE CLASSIFIED BY THE BAKER GRADING SCALE.1 CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BAKER GRADES III AND IV ARE THE MOST SEVERE. BAKER GRADE III OFTEN RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SURGERY (REOPERATION) BECAUSE OF PAIN AND POSSIBLY ABNORMAL APPEARANCE. BAKER GRADE IV USUALLY RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR REOPERATION BECAUSE OF PAIN AND UNACCEPTABLE APPEARANCE. OTHER REASONS FOR REOPERATIONS ARE DISCUSSED IN THE ONLINE PATIENT LABELING IN SECTION 5.5 ALLERGANÂ¿S CLINICAL STUDY RESULTS: WHAT ARE THE MAIN REASONS FOR REOPERATION? GLOSSARY: CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE - A TIGHTENING OF THE SCAR TISSUE (ALSO CALLED A CAPSULE) THAT NORMALLY FORMS AROUND THE BREAST IMPLANT DURING THE HEALING PROCESS AFTER SURGERY. IN SOME WOMEN, THE SCAR TISSUE (CAPSULE) SQUEEZES THE IMPLANT. WHEN THIS OCCURS, IT IS CALLED CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. THIS RESULTS IN FIRMNESS OR HARDENING OF THE BREAST, AND IS A RISK FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS CLASSIFIED BY BAKER GRADES. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BAKER GRADES III AND IV ARE THE MOST SEVERE. BAKER GRADE III OFTEN RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SURGERY (REOPERATION) BECAUSE OF PAIN AND POSSIBLY ABNORMAL APPEARANCE. BAKER GRADE IV USUALLY RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SURGERY (REOPERATION) BECAUSE OF PAIN AND UNACCEPTABLE APPEARANCE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BAKER GRADE II MAY ALSO RESULT IN THE NEED FOR SURGERY. EACH GRADE IS DESCRIBED BELOW. BAKER GRADE I Â¿ NORMALLY SOFT AND NATURAL APPEARANCE. BAKER GRADE II Â¿ A LITTLE FIRM, BUT BREAST LOOKS NORMAL. BAKER GRADE III Â¿ MORE FIRM THAN NORMAL, AND MAY LOOK ABNORMAL (CHANGE IN SHAPE). BAKER GRADE IV Â¿ HARD, OBVIOUS DISTORTION, AND RUPTURE - A HOLE OR TEAR IN THE SHELL OF THE IMPLANT THAT ALLOWS SILICONE GEL FILLER MATERIAL TO LEAK FROM THE SHELL. RUPTURES CAN BE INTRACAPSULAR (INSIDE THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT) OR EXTRACAPSULAR (OUTSIDE THE SCAR TISSUE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT). WARNINGS: RUPTURE OF A SILICONE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT IS MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR SURGEON WILL KNOW THAT YOUR IMPLANTS HAVE A RUPTURE. THEREFORE YOU WILL NEED REGULAR MRI SCREENINGS OVER YOUR LIFETIME IN ORDER TO DETERMINE IF RUPTURE IS PRESENT. YOU SHOULD HAVE AN MRI 3 YEARS AFTER YOUR BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY AND THEN EVERY 2 YEARS AFTER THAT FOR AS LONG AS YOU HAVE YOUR BREAST IMPLANTS. IF IMPLANT RUPTURE IS NOTED ON AN MRI, YOU SHOULD HAVE THE IMPLANT REMOVED, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT.|STYLE 45 SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|45-550|07/27/2017||||N|R||0HP|FTR|1.0|04/22/2011|PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||1266902|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM.

6431836|70889565|D|1||"IN (B)(6) 2010 MY MOTHER WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER LEFT BREAST, SHE UNDERWENT A MASTECTOMY AND ON (B)(6) 2010, SHE UNDERWENT SURGERY AND HAF A 363LF-690 BREAST IMPLANT INSERTED. SHE BECAME EXTREMELY ILL IN (B)(6) 2012, SHE DID NOT GO TO THE HOSPITAL UNTIL (B)(6) 2013 BECAUSE SHE DID NOT HAVE ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. SHE WAS ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL ON (B)(6) 2013 WITH UNCONTROLLED DIARRHEA. SHE WAS ADMITTED AGAIN ON (B)(6) 2013 WITH DEHYDRATION AND ON (B)(6) 2013 DEHYDRATION. ON (B)(6) 2013 SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH METASTATIC BREAST CANCER TO BRAIN, LIVER, ESSENTIALLY THROUGHOUT HER ENTIRE BODY. SHE WAS TRANSFERRED TO INPATIENT REHAB ON (B)(6) 2013. FOLLOW UP VISIT WITH THE NEUROLOGIST SHOWED THAT ALTHOUGH SHE HAD MANY BRAIN LESIONS, THE SPINAL TAP WAS NEGATIVE FOR CANCER CELLS. A FULL BODY AND BRAIN PET SCAN WAS COMPLETED ON (B)(6) 2013. THIS SHOWED THAT SHE HAD LESIONS (TOO MANY TO COUNT) THROUGHOUT HER ENTIRE BODY. THE NEUROLOGIST WAS NOT CONVINCED THAT IT WAS METASTATIC BREAST CANCER IN THE BRAIN BECAUSE IT WAS ATYPICAL OF WHAT HE SAW WITH BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. HE THOUGHT POSSIBLE SARCOID OR LYMPHOMA. THE NEUROLOGIST STARTED HER ON LARGE DOSES OF STEROIDS AND OVER SEVERAL MONTHS AND REPEATED THE FULL BODY AND BRAIN PET SCAN ON (B)(6) 2013 WHICH THE RADIOLOGIST COMPARED TO THE PET SCAN OF (B)(6) 2013. THE RADIOLOGIST REPORTED THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE LESIONS FOUND ON THE (B)(6) 2013 EXAM HAD ESSENTIALLY ""MELTED"" AWAY AND THE HYPER METABOLIC BOWEL WAS COMPLETELY RESOLVED. HE ALSO WROTE ""BOTH OF THE ABOVE FINDINGS UNDOUBTEDLY REPRESENT SARCOID. AS THE NEUROLOGIST BEGAN TAPERING OFF THE STEROIDS, HE REPEATED SEVERAL MRI'S OF HER BRAIN, IN (B)(6) 2013, SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY AND BEGAN INCREASING THE STEROIDS TO SOME DEGREE. IN (B)(6) 2015, SHE BEGAN HAVING VISION PROBLEMS AND HEADACHES. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE LESIONS HAD RETURNED AND THIS TIME, THEY WERE ON HER RETINAS AS WELL THROUGHOUT HER ENTIRE BODY. WE TOOK HER TO (B)(6) CLINIC FOR EVALUATION OF HER RETINAS. WE DISCUSSED OUR THEORY THAT THIS WAS POSSIBLY RELATED TO THE BREAST IMPLANT AND NOT BREAST METASTASES. THE PHYSICIANS AT (B)(6) REVIEWED ALL OF THE MEDICAL RECORDS THAT WE BROUGHT WITH US AND FELT THAT SARCOID WAS A POSSIBILITY BUT WOULD NEED TO BIOPSY HER RETINA TO DETERMINE FOR SURE. THE BIOPSY WAS DONE AT (B)(6) CLINIC AND WAS REPORTED TO BE BREAST METASTASES. AT THIS POINT, SHE CONTINUED WITH FOLLOW UP VISITS TO MULTIPLE DOCTORS. ON (B)(6) 2015 MET WITH ONCOLOGISTS AT (B)(6) AT FAMILY REQUEST - PATIENT AND FAMILY REQUESTED THAT THE IMPLANT BE REMOVED BUT THEY DID NOT WANT TO DO IT. SHE MET WITH (B)(6) ONCOLOGIST ON (B)(6) 2015 WHERE SHE AGAIN REQUESTED THAT THE IMPLANT BE REMOVED. THE ONCOLOGIST SCHEDULED A LIVER BIOPSY AND THAT WAS DONE ON (B)(6) 2015. REPEATED VISITS TO DIFFERENT ONCOLOGISTS REPORTED THAT SHE HAD BREAST METASTASES AND WOULD NEED CHEMOTHERAPY. SHE REFUSED TO UNDERGO CHEMOTHERAPY. SHE HAD A LIVER BIOPSY ON (B)(6) 2015 AT (B)(6) CANCER INSTITUTE AND AGAIN SHE RECEIVED THE DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST METASTASES. SHE PASSED AWAY ON (B)(6) 2015 AT THE AGE OF (B)(6) YEARS.

A REVIEW OF DEVICE HISTORY RECORD HAS BEEN INITIATED. IF ANY NEW, CHANGED OR CORRECTION INFORMATION IS NOTED, A SUPPLEMENTAL MEDWATCH WILL BE SUBMITTED. ADVERSE EVENTS: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, ASYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER THESE ADDITIONAL SURGERIES. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF DEFLATION. INFECTION Â¿ IN RARE INSTANCES, ACUTE INFECTION MAY OCCUR IN A BREAST WITH IMPLANTS. THE SIGNS OF ACUTE INFECTION INCLUDE ERYTHEMA, TENDERNESS, FLUID ACCUMULATION, PAIN, AND FEVER. VERY RARELY, TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME, A POTENTIALLY LIFE-THREATENING CONDITION, HAS BEEN REPORTED IN WOMEN AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY. IT IS CHARACTERIZED BY SYMPTOMS THAT OCCUR SUDDENLY AND INCLUDE HIGH FEVER (102Â°F, 38.8Â°C OR HIGHER), VOMITING, DIARRHEA, A SUNBURN-LIKE RASH, RED EYES, DIZZINESS, LIGHTHEADEDNESS, MUSCLE ACHES, AND DROPS IN BLOOD PRESSURE, WHICH MAY CAUSE FAINTING. PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED TO CONTACT A PHYSICIAN IMMEDIATELY FOR DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT FOR ANY OF THESE SYMPTOMS. ADDITIONAL COMPLICATIONS Â¿ AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. CALCIUM DEPOSITS CAN FORM IN THE TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT WITH SYMPTOMS THAT MAY INCLUDE PAIN AND FIRMNESS. LYMPHADENOPATHY HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED IN SOME WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS.|STYLE 68 SALINE FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|68-600|07/26/2017||||N|R||0HP|FWM|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||2970624|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||68-600||True

I WAS EXAMINED REGULARLY OVER THE 3 YEARS BECAUSE I WAS PART OF A SILICONE IMPLANT STUDY PRIOR TO THE FDA'S OFFICIAL APPROVAL OF SILICONE IMPLANTS FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC. RECENTLY, I DECIDED TO HAVE THEM REMOVED DUE TO SOME DISCOMFORT AND DISSATISFACTION WITH THE RESULTS OF THE SURGERY. I SAW A NUMBER OF SURGEONS TO DISCUSS REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANTS AND WAS EXAMINED BY A NUMBER OF DOCTORS, NONE OF WHICH MADE A RECOMMENDATION THAT I GET AN MRI. NONE OF THEM EVEN SUSPECTED A RUPTURE. I CHOSE A SURGEON WHO AGREED TO REMOVE THE IMPLANTS WITHOUT REPLACING THEM. I WAS TOLD IT WOULD BE A FAIRLY STRAIGHT FORWARD PROCEDURE. DURING SURGERY, HE DISCOVERED THAT ONE OF MY IMPLANTS HAD RUPTURED AND IT APPEARED AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN RUPTURED FOR A WHILE. DUE TO THE RUPTURE, THE SURGERY BECAME MORE COMPLICATED AS HE HAD TO SPEND A LOT MORE TIME CLEANING UP THE MESS CREATED BY THE RUPTURED SILICONE IMPLANT IN MY LEFT BREAST. IN THE PROCESS OF REMOVING THE SCATTERED SILICONE MORE BREAST TISSUE THAN ORIGINALLY EXPECTED WAS REMOVED DURING THE ""CLEAN UP"". FOLLOWING THE SURGERY I AM LEFT WITH A BREAST WHICH IS TAKING A LOT LONGER TO HEAL, I HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS WITH LEFT BREAST FOLLOWING THE SURGERY INCLUDING A LOT OF FLUID BUILD UP AND MULTIPLE DRAINS INSERTED TO HELP WITH THE FLUID DRAINAGE AND HEALING AND I'M STILL EXPERIENCING PAIN. I AM ALSO LEFT WITH UNEVEN BREASTS DUE TO THE COMPLICATION OF THE RUPTURED IMPLANT, AND THE ADD'L BREAST TISSUE REMOVED FROM THE BREAST WITH THE RUPTURED IMPLANT.

ACCORDING TO ALLERGAN, THEY RECOMMEND GETTING MRIS AFTER A CERTAIN NUMBER OF YEARS OR WHEN SUGGESTED BY A PHYSICIAN. I WAS EXAMINED MORE THAN MOST SILICONE IMPLANT PTS WOULD TYPICALLY BE, SINCE I WAS PART OF A STUDY WHICH REQUIRED CLOSE EXAMINATION AND REGULAR FOLLOW-UPS, AND I WAS NEVER TOLD TO GET AN MRI AND I WAS NEVER GIVEN ANY INDICATION THAT THE IMPLANT COULD HAVE RUPTURED EVEN WHEN I WAS EXPERIENCING SOME DISCOMFORT. CURRENTLY, ALLERGAN HAS THE IMPLANTS AND ARE INVESTIGATING THE CAUSE OF THE RUPTURE AND I'M STILL WAITING TO HEAR BACK FROM THEM. I DO NOT THINK THAT ALLERGAN HAS PUT THE APPROPRIATE MEASURES IN PLACE TO HELP PTS IDENTIFY RUPTURES EARLY ON TO AVOID LONG TERM PROBLEMS, SUCH AS PERMANENT DISFIGURATION AS I'VE EXPERIENCED. AND THEY CERTAINLY ARE NOT FOLLOWING APPROPRIATE BUSINESS PRACTICES TO RESOLVE ISSUES WHEN THEY OCCUR. IT IS COMPLETELY UNFAIR AND UNETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICE TO REFUSE TO PAY OUT THE SURGICAL COSTS OF THE IMPLANT REMOVAL BASED ON WHAT THEY SEE AS A ""LOOP HOLE"" WHEN THEIR WARRANTY SAYS THAT SURGICAL AND IMPLANT REPLACEMENT COSTS WILL BE PAID IF AN IMPLANT IS FAULTY. I DO NOT WANT THEM REPLACED AFTER THE TRAUMA I HAVE EXPERIENCED WITH THE FIRST IMPLANTS BUT I DO WANT THE SURGICAL COSTS FOR REMOVING THE IMPLANTS TO BE PAID FOR BY ALLERGAN AS THIS IS WHAT THEIR WARRANTY IS FOR.

INITIAL CLINICAL PRESENTATION (B)(6) 2010. THIS IS (B)(6) FEMALE WITH A HISTORY OF DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU OF THE LEFT BREAST DIAGNOSED IN 1998. SHE SUBSEQUENTLY UNDERWENT A LEFT MASTECTOMY WHERE THE SPECIMEN WEIGHT WAS 596 GRAMS. SHE UNDERWENT IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION WITH PLACEMENT OF SUBMUSCULAR TISSUE EXPANDER BY PLASTIC SURGEON #1. THE TISSUE EXPANDER WAS PLACED COMPLETELY SUBPECTORAL AND ALSO IN A SUBSERRATUS POCKET. THE EXPANDER WAS REMOVED IN 1999 AND REPLACED WITH A MCGHAN 440 ML DUAL-CHAMBER SILICONE AND SALINE-FILLED IMPLANT. SHE RECEIVED NO POSTOPERATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY OR RADIATION THERAPY. WITHIN A YEAR, SHE DEVELOPED SIGNIFICANT HARDENING AND DISTORTION OF THE LEFT RECONSTRUCTED BREAST WITH GRADUAL ELEVATION OF THE IMPLANT, TIGHTENING OF THE TISSUE AROUND THE IMPLANT, AND DISCOMFORT IN THE LEFT CHEST WALL. SHE WAS SEEN IN EVALUATION IN 2006 BY PLASTIC SURGEON #2, WHO RE-OPERATED ON HER LEFT BREAST AND REMOVED THE EXISTING IMPLANT, PERFORMED PERIPROSTHETIC CAPSULOTOMIES WHICH WERE NOT SPECIFIED IN THE OPERATIVE NOTE, SUBMITTED CAPSULAR TISSUE FOR HISTOLOGIC EXAMINATION (INTERPRETED AS NEGATIVE) AND REPLACED A SMALLER SALINE IMPLANT. THIS WAS AN ALLERGAN-STYLE 68MP SALINE IMPLANT, SIZE 390-420 ML. THIS RECONSTRUCTION WAS SOFT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, BUT WITHIN 1 YEAR, SHE HAD RECURRENCE OF THE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE WITH TIGHTENING OF THE TISSUE AROUND THE IMPLANT, GRADUAL ELEVATION OF THE IMPLANT LOCATION, AND DISCOMFORT IN THE LEFT CHEST WALL. SHE WAS SEEN IN EVALUATION IN 2009 BY PLASTIC SURGEON #4 WHO RECOMMENDED THAT SHE CONSIDER REVISION OF HER RECONSTRUCTION WITH THE ADDITION OF AN CELLULAR DERMAL MATRIX TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR RECURRENCE OF HER CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE AROUND THE DEVICE. PLASTIC SURGEON #4 ALSO RECOMMENDED AUTOLOGOUS ABDOMINAL FLAP RECONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES. THE PT WAS INTERESTED IN CONSIDERING A DIEP FLAP AND PLASTIC SURGEON #4 REFERRED HER TO ME ((B)(6) SURGEON #5) FOR EVALUATION AND CONSIDERATION OF A FREE FLAP BREAST RECONSTRUCTION PROCEDURE. THE PT'S PAST MEDICAL HISTORY WAS ADDITIONALLY SIGNIFICANT FOR A HISTORY OF HYPOTHYROIDISM AND BLADDER PROLAPSE. HER MEDICATIONS INCLUDED SYNTHROID 88 MCG DAILY, VITAMIN D, AND ADVIL. SHE IS A NONSMOKER AND DRINKS ALCOHOL RARELY. INITIAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION, (B)(6) 2010, SHOWED THE PT WAS 155 CM TALL, 70.3 KG. THE LEFT BREAST WAS ABSENT THROUGH A TRANSVERSE STEWART-TYPE MASTECTOMY INCISION. THERE WAS AN IMPLANT PRESENT IN THE SUBPECTORAL POSITION ON THE LEFT SIDE. THERE WAS A BAKER GRADE IV CAPSULE CONTRACTURE AROUND THIS DEVICE, WHICH WAS RIGIDLY AFFIXED TO HER CHEST WALL AND SOMEWHAT TENDER TO MANIPULATION. THE WOUNDS WERE WELL HEALED WITH NO EVIDENCE OF SCAR HYPERTROPHY. THE RIGHT BREAST WAS MORE PTOTIC WITH A DEGREE OF PSEUDOPTOSIS, LATERAL BOTTOMING OUT AND A WISE-PATTERN SCAR FROM PREVIOUS MASTOPEXY - RESULTING IN SUBSTANTIAL SHAPE AND VOLUME ASYMMETRY. ON THE LEFT SIDE, THE STERNAL NOTCH TO INFRAMAMMARY FOLD DISTANCE WAS 20 CM. ON THE RIGHT SIDE, THE STERNAL NOTCH TO INFRAMAMMARY FOLD DISTANCE WAS 23 CM. THE MID-CLAVICULAR POINT TO NIPPLE DISTANCE ON THE RIGHT WAS 21 CM. EXAMINATION OF THE ABDOMEN SHOWED A GENEROUS AMOUNT OF TISSUE IN THE LOWER 1/3 OF THE ABDOMEN FOR ABDOMINAL FLAP CONSIDERATION. INITIAL IMPRESSION, (B)(6) 2010. THIS WAS A (B)(6) FEMALE WITH RECURRENT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE FOLLOWING 2 PREVIOUS IMPLANT-BASED RECONSTRUCTION SURGERIES ON THE LEFT SIDE. THE LEFT BREAST RECONSTRUCTION SHOWED ELEVATION OF THE INFRAMAMMARY FOLD AND A SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE AROUND THE EXISTING IMPLANT. I RECOMMENDED REMOVAL OF THE EXISTING LEFT BREAST IMPLANT, RECONSTRUCTION OF THE ORIGINS OF THE LEFT PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE AND RECONSTRUCTION OF THE LEFT BREAST WITH A FREE ABDOMINAL FLAP. OPERATIVE FINDINGS ON (B)(6) 2011: THE LEFT BREAST IMPLANT CAPSULE WAS OPENED AND CONTAINED A CLOUDY YELLOW FLUID UNDER ENORMOUS PRESSURE, THE FLUID SQUIRTED OUT OF THE CAPSULAR INCISION AND TRAVELED AT LEAST 56 INCHES. THERE WAS A COLLECTION OF GELATINOUS MATERIAL WITHIN THE CAPSULE AS WELL AS AN INTACT SALINE BREAST IMPLANT. THE CAPSULE WAS THICKENED AND COVERED WITH PLAQUE-LIKE LESIONS INTERNALLY. A TOTAL CAPSULECTOMY WAS PERFORMED, THE PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE WAS REATTACHED TO ITS 5TH RIB ORIGINS. THE PERIPROSTHETIC FLUID WAS CAPTURED, AND ALL MATERIAL WAS SENT FOR PATHOLOGIC AND CYTOLOGIC EVALUATION INCLUDING FROZEN SECTION WHICH WAS CONSISTENT WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF ALCL.

3023802|10610793|N|1||(B)(4). DEVICE LABELLING ADDRESSES SEROMA AND ALCL: ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA. BASED ON INFO REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL, BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGAN'S AND OTHER MFRS' BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMENT FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION SHOWED A SYMMETRICAL BREASTS WITH NO OVERLYING SKIN OR NIPPLE CHANGES. THERE WERE TWO LARGE MOBILE NODES PALPABLE IN THE LEFT AXILLA. INITIAL BREAST MAMMOGRAPHY AND ULTRASONOGRAPHY CONFIRMED LEFT AXILLARY LYMPHADENOPATHY BUT DID NOT SHOW ANY PERI-IMPLANT FLUID COLLECTION. BIOPSY OF THE LEFT AXILLARY MASS SHOWED FINDINGS CONSISTENT WITH CLASSIC HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA, NODULAR SCLEROSING TYPE. IT LACKED TWO TYPICAL STAINS-CD15 AND PAX5. PET-CT SHOWED A 5-CM AREA OF PET-AVID LEFT AXILLARY LYMPHADENOPATHY. HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA STAGE IA WAS DIAGNOSED. THE PT THEN HAD TWO CYCLES OF ADRIAMYCIN, BLEOMYCIN, VINBLASTINE, AND DACARBAZINE (ABVD) AND 2000 GY OF FIELD RADIATION TO THE LEFT AXILLA. HER INITIAL TREATMENT WAS COMPLETED IN (B)(6) 2011. F/U CT SCAN IN (B)(6) 2011, SHOWED A DECREASE IN THE SIZE OF THE LEFT AXILLARY LYMPHADENOPATHY. UNILATERAL FLUID COLLECTION, HOWEVER, WAS NOTED AROUND THE LEFT BREAST IMPLANT (FIGURE).

ALLERGAN LABELING ADDRESSES THE EVENT OF BREAST LUMPS AS FOLLOWS: BREAST SELF-EXAMINATIONS: FOLLOWING BREAST AUGMENTATION, YOU SHOULD CONTINUE TO PERFORM BREAST SELF-EXAMINATION MONTHLY. THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH A BREAST IMPLANT IN PLACE. TO CONTINUE TO PERFORM A MONTHLY BREAST SELF EXAMINATION EFFICIENTLY, YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU IDENTIFY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLANT AND YOUR BREAST TISSUE. BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE IMPLANT FROM BREAST TISSUE WILL DECREASE THE NECESSITY OF EXCESSIVE SQUEEZING OF THE IMPLANT DURING EXAMINATION. ANY NEW LUMPS SHOULD BE EVALUATED WITH A BIOPSY, AS APPROPRIATE. IF A BIOPSY IS PERFORMED, BE SURE TO INFORM THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL PERFORMING THE BIOPSY THAT YOU HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS SO THAT CARE WILL BE TAKEN TO AVOID INJURING THE IMPLANT. THE 410 DEVICE LABELING ADDRESSES ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL): BASED ON INFO REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGAN'S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERS' BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.

HIS WIFE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH LEFT SIDE BREAST CANCER APPROXIMATELY 2009, AND UNDERWENT A LEFT SIDE MASTECTOMY WITH RIGHT SIDE BREAST AUGMENTATION. THE PHYSICIAN IMPLANTED BILATERAL TISSUE EXPANDERS AT THAT TIME. THE TISSUE EXPANDERS WERE EXPLANTED ON (B)(6) 2014 WITH PERMANENT BREAST DEVICES IMPLANTED. BY THIS TIME, THE PT OBSERVED THAT THE EXPANDERS HAD ""BEGUN TO BREAK DOWN."" AFTER THE RECONSTRUCTION SURGERY, THE PT STATED IN HER POST-OP PERIOD THAT ""SHE DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT."" TWO DRAINS HAD BEEN PLACED AND LEFT IN FOR TWO WEEKS POST-OP, AND WERE VERY PAINFUL, ACCORDING TO THE HUSBAND, AND THAT HE AND HIS WIFE BOTH NOTICED THAT THE IMPLANTS WERE ""LARGER THAN THE TISSUE EXPANDERS HAD BEEN."" HIS WIFE TOLD HIM AT THE TIME, ""I DON'T REMEMBER THESE BREAST WERE SUPPOSED TO BE THIS BIG. THIS WAS A REALLY BAD DECISION."" APPROXIMATELY (B)(6), SHE ""FELT A POP AND WONDERED IF THERE WAS A RUPTURE, NOTED SLIGHT WEEPING ON RIGHT SIDE. SHE ALSO FELT CHEST PAIN DURING THIS PERIOD. THE PT SAW HER PHYSICIAN WHO INFORMED HER THAT IT WAS LIKELY AN ""INTERNAL STITCH SHE FELT, AND IT WAS NOT UNUSUAL FOR WEEPING TO OCCUR AT SUTURE SITE."" THERE WAS NO TREATMENT GIVEN THE PT AT THAT TIME. FROM THAT TIME UNTIL (B)(6) 2014 THE PT STILL DID NOT FEEL VERY WELL. SHE BEGAN A MILD YOGA EXERCISE THAT DAY, AND COMPLAINED OF A SORE CHEST, SO SHE FELT SHE HAD OVERDONE IT. THE HUSBAND NOTICED SHE WAS RETAINING FLUID. ON (B)(6) 2014, SHE FELT SHE HAD THE FLU, WITH MALAISE/HIGH FEVER, AND THEN DEVELOPED VOMITING AND DIARRHEA. AT 1 AM ON (B)(6) 2014, THE PT ROLLED OFF THE BED, WAS DELIRIOUS, BUT STILL COMMUNICATIVE. HER TEMPERATURE WAS 103. SHE ""WENT UNCONSCIOUS BUT WAS RESPONSIVE"" AND HER HUSBAND CALLED 911. WHEN THE EMTS ARRIVED THEREAFTER, SHE HAD NO PULSE. IN THE ER, HER BP WAS 60/12. ""SHE WAS ON A VENTILATOR AND IN THE ICU IMMEDIATELY, ON STEROIDS, PRESSORS, AND IN AN INDUCED COMA FOR 4-5 DAYS. HER RIGHT BREAST WAS SO STRETCHED FROM SWELLING WITH INFECTION THAT YOU COULD SEE CLEAR FLUID WEEPING FROM IT. THERE WAS MUCH CLEAR FLUID FROM THE MASTECTOMY. SHE WAS ON DIALYSIS. SHE ACTUALLY STARTED TO IMPROVE AFTER SHE WAS EXPLANTED. THE SWELLING DECREASED, MEDS WERE BEING WEANED, BUT HER SKIN WAS SLOUGHING. HER FINGERTIPS, HER FEET WERE TURNING BLACK."" THE PT'S DATE OF DEATH WAS (B)(6) 2014. THE PT'S HUSBAND VERIFIED THE PROVISIONAL DEATH CERTIFICATE LISTED THE CAUSE OF DEATH AS COMPLICATIONS OF BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY/TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME.

SO I REQUESTED TO SEE AN ENDOCRINOLOGIST. ONCE AGAIN ACCORDING TO THE TEST, I'M A PERFECTLY HEALTHY PERSON. I CONTINUED TO FEEL WORSE. I BEGAN TO HAVE MORE ACHES AND PAIN IN HANDS, WRIST, FINGERS AND MY KNEE, AND CONSTANTLY DROPPING ITEMS. I REQUESTED TO BE SEEN BY A RHEUMATOLOGIST. THE BLOOD WORK CAME POSITIVE FOR AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE. WHICH ACCORDING TO THE RHEUMATOLOGIST HE CANT PINPOINT EXACTLY WHICH ILLNESS I HAVE, UNBELIEVABLE. SO NOW I WILL BE SEEING ANOTHER RHEUMATOLOGIST. HOPEFULLY HE'LL BE ABLE TO PROPERLY DIAGNOSE ME. NOW FROM 2013-2014, I BEGAN HAVING SEVERE PROBLEMS WITH MY MEMORY, SOME HEADACHES AND EYE PRESSURE, DIZZY SPELL ETC. SO, I REQUESTED MRI OF BRAIN AND WAS DIAGNOSED BY MY NEUROLOGIST WITH (ISCHEMIA OF BRAIN). FURTHER TESTS HAVE BEEN REQUESTED BY THE NEUROLOGIST. SO I, AS A CONSUMER, DO STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT ALL THESE PROBLEMS CAME ABOUT AFTER THAT SURGERY.

4925516|17832768|N|1||(B)(4). POTENTIAL STUDIES INDICATE THAT BREAST CANCER IS NO MORE COMMON IN WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS THAN THOSE WITHOUT IMPLANTS. A LARGE, LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP FOUND NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE RISK RATES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CANCERS, INCLUDING STOMACH CANCER, LEUKEMIA, AND LYMPHOMA. IN THE (B)(4) STUDY, AT LEAST 1 REOPERATION WAS PERFORMED ON 315 PTS (36.5%) THROUGH 10 YEARS. A TOTAL OF 424 REOPERATIONS WERE PERFORMED. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR REOPERATION THROUGH 10 YEARS ON AUGMENTATION PATIENTS WAS IMPLANT DEFLATION AT 21.7%. THE PERCENTAGE OF REOPERATIONS DUE TO LUMP/MASS/CYST INCREASED FROM 8.5% OF 293 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 5 YEARS TO 13.9% OF 424 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 10 YEARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF LUMPS, MASSES, AND CYSTS CAN BE EXPECTED TO NATURALLY INCREASE AS PTS AGE AND COULD BE AN EXPLANATION FOR THE INCREASE. IN RARE INSTANCES, ACUTE INFECTION MAY OCCUR IN A BREAST WITH IMPLANTS. THE SIGNS OF ACUTE INFECTION INCLUDE ERYTHEMA, TENDERNESS, FLUID ACCUMULATION, PAIN, AND FEVER. VERY RARELY, TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME, A POTENTIALLY LIFE-THREATENING CONDITION, HAS BEEN REPORTED IN WOMEN AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY. IT IS CHARACTERIZED BY SYMPTOMS THAT OCCUR SUDDENLY AND INCLUDE HIGH FEVER (102 DEGREE F, 38.8 DEGREE C OR HIGHER), VOMITING, DIARRHEA, A SUNBURN-LIKE RASH, RED EYES, DIZZINESS, LIGHTHEADEDNESS, MUSCLE ACHES, AND DROPS IN BLOOD PRESSURE, WHICH MAY CAUSE FAINTING. PTS SHOULD BE ADVISED TO CONTACT A PHYSICIAN IMMEDIATELY FOR DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT FOR ANY OF THESE SYSTEMS. POTENTIALS ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, SYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. CALCIUM DEPOSITS CAN FORM IN THE TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT WITH SYMPTOMS THAT MAY INCLUDE PAIN AND FIRMNESS.

4749049|43652444|N|1||EXPLANTED DEVICE HAS NOT YET BEEN RETURNED. DEVICE LABELING: BREAST IMPLANT RUPTURE IS CONSIDERED Â¿SILENTÂ¿ WHEN IT OCCURS WITHOUT ANY OTHER PROBLEMS, SIGNS, OR SYMPTOMS. BREAST IMPLANT RUPTURE IS CONSIDERED Â¿SYMPTOMATICÂ¿ WHEN IT IS ACCOMPANIED BY CHANGES IN THE LOOK OR FEEL OF THE BREAST AND/OR BREAST IMPLANT. ADVISE YOUR PATIENT THAT SHE WILL NEED TO HAVE REGULAR MRIS TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE EVEN IF SHE IS HAVING NO PROBLEMS. MRI SCREENINGS SHOULD BE PERFORMED AT 3 YEARS POSTOPERATIVELY, THEN EVERY 2 YEARS THEREAFTER. IF RUPTURE IS NOTED VIA MRI, THEN YOU SHOULD ADVISE YOUR PATIENT TO HAVE HER IMPLANT REMOVED. BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. BREAST IMPLANTS RUPTURE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. RUPTURES CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO RUPTURE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, STRESSING THE IMPLANT DURING IMPLANTATION AND WEAKENING IT, FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL, EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED), TRAUMA, COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING, AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF RUPTURE FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT. IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF RUPTURE. LABORATORY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RUPTURE ARE ONGOING. SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE. IF RUPTURE OCCURS, SILICONE GEL MAY EITHER REMAIN WITHIN THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), MOVE OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE (EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), OR MOVE OUTSIDE THE BREAST (GEL MIGRATION). THERE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY THAT RUPTURE MAY PROGRESS FROM INTRACAPSULAR TO EXTRACAPSULAR AND BEYOND. PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY TO THEIR BREAST AND/OR IMPLANT WILL LIKELY BE NECESSARY OVER THE COURSE OF THEIR LIVES. ADDITIONAL SURGERIES TO THE PATIENTSÂ¿ BREASTS WILL LIKELY BE REQUIRED, EITHER BECAUSE OF IMPLANT RUPTURE, OTHER COMPLICATIONS, OR UNACCEPTABLE COSMETIC OUTCOMES. EXPLANTED DEVICES SHOULD BE INTRAOPERATIVELY ASSESSED BY THE EXPLANTING SURGEON TO IDENTIFY THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF IMPLANT RUPTURE AND GEL MIGRATION AND RETURNED TO ALLERGAN FOR EVALUATION. RUPTURED BREAST IMPLANTS MUST BE REPORTED AND SHOULD BE RETURNED TO ALLERGAN.|STYLE 15 SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|15-304|05/01/2015||05/09/2016|DA|R|Y||0HP|FTR|1.0|04/12/2013|PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||1597907|||LA AURORA DE HEREDIA|CS|ALLERGAN|||||||True

THE EVENT OF LYMPHOMA WAS SENT VIA EASR AGAIN ON (B)(6) 2013 WHEN THE EVENT OF DEFLATION WAS INITIALLY REPORTED VIA EASR ON (B)(6) 2013.

BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS DEFLATE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR A HOLE. DEFLATION CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO DEFLATE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS; FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL; EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED); TRAUMA; COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING; AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF DEFLATION FOR ALLERGAN'S PRODUCT; HOWEVER, IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF DEFLATION. PUBLISHED STUDIES INDICATE THAT BREAST CANCER IS NO MORE COMMON IN WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS THAN THOSE WITHOUT IMPLANTS. A LARGE, LONG-TERM FOLLOW UP FOUND NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE RISK RATES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CANCERS, INCLUDING STOMACH CANCER, LEUKEMIA, AND LYMPHOMA.

BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS DEFLATE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. DEFLATION CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO DEFLATE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS; FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL; EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (EG DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED); TRAUMA; COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING; AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE.

I REALLY HADN'T BEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO ANY CERTAIN SYMPTOM UNTIL IN EARLY (B)(6) 2014, I WAS EXERCISING AND NOTICED A SEVERE PAIN IN MY RIGHT CALF MUSCLE. I THOUGHT I HAD TORN MY CALF BUT AFTER A WEEK IT WENT AWAY. AS I CONTINUED TO EXERCISE I NOTICED EXTREME FATIGUE IN MY MUSCLES AND REALIZED THAT I COULD NOT LIFT MY RIGHT FOOT. SEARCHING THE INTERNET I REALIZED I HAD FOOT DROP. AT THE SAME TIME I HAD STARTED NOTICING MY MUSCLES TWITCHING. I AM AN INTERNET RESEARCHER AND WHAT I WAS FINDING WAS INCREDIBLY SCARY. IN ADDITION, MY RIGHT BREAST HAD AN EPISODE OF SWELLING AND PAIN. I SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT FOR THE BREAST. THEY DID ULTRASOUND, MAMMO, AND THEN MRI. FINDING FLUID UNDER THE IMPLANT THEY SCHEDULED A BIOPSY AND MENTIONED ALCL. DURING THE APPOINTMENT FOR THE BIOPSY THE DOC COULD NOT FIND ENOUGH FLUID TO BIOPSY AND BECAUSE THE PAIN WAS GONE HE ABORTED THE PROCEDURE. FAST FORWARD TO (B)(6) 2014, I SAW A GP FOR THE MUSCLE CRAMPS AND FOOT DROP, SHE REFERRED ME TO A NEUROLOGIST. I ASKED ALL DOCTORS IF MY IMPLANTS COULD BE (THE RADIOLOGIST FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF RUPTURE) RELATED AT ALL - ALL SAID ""OH, BUT I'M NO EXPERT."" NEUROLOGIST #1 DID A COUPLE OF TESTS OF MY BLOOD (FOR COPPER) AND AN EMG. SAID I DEFINITELY HAD WEAKNESS AND UNEXPLAINED FOOT DROP SO I ""PROBABLY HAVE ALS"", SO MY WORLD HAS COME CRASHING DOWN. WE GOT A SECOND OPINION FROM A NEUROLOGIST THAT SPECIALIZES IN ALS. UPON FIRST MEETING HE SAID IT COULD BE SO MANY THINGS. ORDERED ANOTHER EMG. THAT DOC SAID THE TEST RESULTS DID NOT SEEM CONSISTENT WITH ALS BUT BECAUSE THERE IS NO TEST FOR ALS IT WOULD BE A WAIT AND SEE SITUATION. ABOUT (B)(6) IN BLOOD TESTS LATER FOR ANY ALS MARKERS OR ANYTHING ELSE, NO CONCLUSION. ANOTHER EMG WAS DONE AT THE ""SPECIALIST'S OFFICE"" AND ONE TECH SAID SOME PARTS OF ME TESTED BETTER THAN LAST TIME AND THEN SOME AREAS LOOKED THE SAME OR ""MAYBE SLIGHTLY WORSE."" AT THIS POINT I HAD STOPPED FOCUSING ON MY BREAST BUT THE RIGHT SIDE STILL DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT. IT IS SLIGHTLY MORE RIGID. I CAN FEEL RIPPLES IN THE IMPLANT, MY NECK APPEARS SLIGHTLY SWOLLEN ON THE RIGHT. SEARCHING BACK THE LAST 8 YEARS I STARTED REALIZING THAT MY MUSCLE WEAKNESSES PROBABLY BEGAN 3-4 YEARS AGO, THE CRAMPS AT LEAST 3-4 YEARS. I'VE STRUGGLED WITH MILD FACIAL BREAK OUTS, SMELLING URINE, MORE EXTREME SYMPTOMS DURING CERTAIN DAYS OF THE MONTH, TONGUE SWELLING, ANXIETY, FATIGUE, ETC. NOT WILLING TO SIT AROUND AND DO NOTHING I AM SEEING A NATUROPATH. HE SAYS MY LYME TEST CAME BACK WITH A 50/50 CHANCE OF ME HAVING LYME. MY B12 IS LOW, MY TESTOSTERONE LEVELS ARE BARELY EXISTENT, AND ONE OTHER MICRONUTRIENT WAS LOW. I'VE SHARED ALL THIS WITH MY NEUROLOGIST AND HE SAYS THAT NONE OF THIS MEANS ANYTHING. I AM GETTING SLIGHTLY WEAKER. I WALK WITH A LIMP DUE TO THE FOOT DROP, JOINT PAIN AND BACK PAIN COME AND GO. FOOT DROP AND MUSCLE TWITCHES REMAIN. MY GUT SAYS ITS THE IMPLANTS AND I KNOW THERE IS NO TEST TO DO FOR A DEFINITIVE ANSWER. ON (B)(6) 2015 I WENT IN FOR EXPLANT. IT WAS FOUND THAT MY RIGHT IMPLANT WAS RUPTURED AND THE SILICONE HAD SPILLED OUT INTO MY TISSUES. THE DOCTOR PERFORMED AN EN BLOC CAPSULECTOMY AND REPLACED THE IMPLANTS WITH MENTOR SALINE IMPLANTS. I AM 1.5 POST EXPLANT AND I NOTICE SOME MILD CHANGES, IMPROVEMENTS. HOWEVER, MUSCLE TWITCHES AND FOOT DROP REMAIN. I HAVE FOUND A (B)(6) GROUP WITH OVER 300 WOMEN THAT ARE EXTREMELY ILL FROM THEIR IMPLANTS AND TRYING TO GET HELP AND GET HEALTHY. I BELIEVE THAT I HAVE SOME SOFT OF SILICONE POISONING THAT IS NOT DETECTED BY MEDICAL TESTS. I AM IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO DO SMALL THINGS TO DETOX, EAT HEALTHY, INFRARED SAUNA, ETC. BUT I AM JUST WAITING AND PRAYING FOR IMPROVEMENT."|NATRELLE SILICONE|20-300|08/25/2015||||*|*||0LP|FTR|0.0||BREAST IMPLANT|||||||ALLERGAN|||||STYLE 20||True

DEVICE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDED: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES TO NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. CALCIUM DEPOSITS CAN FORM IN THE TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT WITH SYMPTOMS THAT MAY INCLUDE PAIN AND FIRMNESS. LYMPHADENOPATHY HAS ALSO BEN REPORTED IN SOME WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS. USE CARE IN SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURES SUCH AS OPEN CAPSULOTOMY, BREAST POCKET REVISION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA ASPIRATION, AND BIOPSY/LUMPECTOMY TO AVOID DAMAGE TO THE IMPLANT. PT SHOULD PERFORM BREAST SELF-EXAMINATIONS MONTHLY AND BE SHOWN HOW TO DISTINGUISH THE IMPLANT FROM THEIR BREAST TISSUE. THE PT SHOULD NOT MANIPULATE OR SQUEEZE THE EXCESSIVELY. THE PT SHOULD BE TOLD THAT THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGE IN THE IMPLANT SHAPE MAY BE SIGNS OF SYMPTOMATIC RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. IF THE PT HAS ANY OF THESE SIGNS, SHE SHOULD BE TOLD TO REPORT THEM, AND POSSIBLY HAVE AN MRI EVAL TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. THE NATRELLE CORE STUDY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE LONG-TERM (10 YEARS) SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PROD. IN ADDITION, ALLERGAN HAS INITIATED A SEPARATE LARGE 10-YEAR POSTAPPROVAL STUDY (BREAST IMPLANT F/U STUDIES, OR BIFS) TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC ISSUES WHICH ALLERGAN'S CORE STUDY WAS NOT DESIGNED TO FULLY ANSWER, AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE A REAL-WORLD ASSESSMENT OF SOME ENDPOINTS. THE ENDPOINTS IN THE BIFS LARGE POSTAPPROVAL STUDY INCLUDE LONG-TERM LOCAL COMPLICATIONS, CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE (CTD), CTD SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS, NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE, NEUROLOGICAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS, OFFSPRING ISSUES, REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES, CANCER SUICIDE, MAMMOGRAPHY ISSUES, AND MRI COMPLIANCE AND RESULTS. ALLERGAN WILL UPDATE THEIR LABELING ON A REGULAR BASIS WITH THE RESULTS OF THESE TWO STUDIES. THERE WAS 1 PRIMARY AUGMENTATION PT WITH A NEW DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER THROUGH 7 YEARS IN THE CORE STUDY. THERE WAS A 13% BENIGN BREAST DISEASE RATE AND 1% MALIGNANT BREAST DISEASE RATE.

5155756|28464643|N|0||DEVICE LABELING: PUBLISHED STUDIES INDICATE THAT BREAST CANCER IS NO MORE COMMON IN WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS THAN THOSE WITHOUT IMPLANTS. A LARGE, LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP FOUND NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE RISK RATES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CANCERS, INCLUDING STOMACH CANCER, LEUKEMIA, AND LYMPHOMA. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, ASYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. DEFLATION Â¿ BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS DEFLATE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. DEFLATION CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO DEFLATE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS; FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL; EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED); TRAUMA; COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING; AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF DEFLATION FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT; HOWEVER, IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF DEFLATION.|STYLE 168 SALINE FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|168-420|10/16/2015||||N|R||0HP|FWM|1.0|05/01/1996|PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||2-163072|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

PATIENTS SHOULD BE INFORMED THAT DISSATISFACTION WITH COSMETIC RESULTS RELATED TO SUCH THINGS AS SCAR DEFORMITY, HYPERTROPHIC SCARRING, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, INCORRECT SIZE, AND IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY MAY OCCUR. LYMPHADENOPATHY HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED IN SOME WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS. THE PATIENT SHOULD BE TOLD THAT THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGE IN THE IMPLANT SHAPE MAY BE SIGNS OF SYMPTOMATIC RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. IF THE PATIENT HAS ANY OF THESE SIGNS, SHE SHOULD BE TOLD TO REPORT THEM AND POSSIBLY HAVE AN MRI EVALUATION TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED TO CONTACT THEIR SURGEON IF THERE IS SIGNIFICANT PAIN OR IF PAIN PERSISTS.

POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, ASYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. OF THE 237 PATIENTS IN THE R95 STUDY, AT LEAST 1 REOPERATION WAS PERFORMED ON 99 PATIENTS (42%) FOR A TOTAL OF 125 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 5 YEARS. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR REOPERATION THROUGH 5 YEARS WAS CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE AT 25.6%. OF THE 237 RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS IN R95, THERE WERE 62 PATIENTS (26.2%) WHO HAD 70 IMPLANTS REMOVED THROUGH 5 YEARS. OF THE 70 RECONSTRUCTION IMPLANTS REMOVED THROUGH 5 YEARS, 70% WERE REPLACED. THE MOST COMMON REASON FOR IMPLANT REMOVAL WAS CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE (31.4%). THROUGH 10 YEARS, THERE WERE 104 IMPLANTS REMOVED FROM 85 PATIENTS. THE MOST COMMON REASON FOR IMPLANT REMOVAL WAS IMPLANT LEAKAGE/DEFLATION (32.7%).|STYLE 363 SALINE FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|363LF-410|11/13/2015||||N|R||0HP|FWM|1.0|10/09/2005|PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||569053|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

RECOVERY FROM THE OPERATION WAS NORMAL AND THE SCARS LOCATED IN THE SUB-MAMMARY FOLD HEALED WELL. HOWEVER, EVEN FROM THE EARLY STAGES I FELT A STRANGE SENSE OF DISSOCIATION FROM MY BODY AND SOCIALLY. I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE IMPLANTS AT THE TIME BUT I FOUND THAT I WAS ALWAYS ON EDGE, IRRITABLE AND ANXIOUS. PHYSICALLY THE IMPLANTS FELT FINE BUT I FOUND THAT THEY DID APPEAR SMALLER AT ABOUT THE 18 MONTH MARK (POSSIBLY DUE TO EARLY STAGE CAPSULATION). THE MAIN PROBLEM OCCURRED AT AROUND 23 MONTHS FOLLOWING SURGERY. ONE MONDAY MORNING IN (B)(6) 2014 I FELT A BIT UNDER THE WEATHER BUT MY PERIOD WAS DUE AND FEELING SLIGHTLY OFF PAR AROUND MENSTRUATION IS SOMETHING I OFTEN EXPERIENCE. HOWEVER, BY THE EVENING A TERRIBLE PAIN ENGULFED BOTH MY BREASTS. IT WAS SIMILAR TO THE USUAL BENIGN, HORMONAL BREAST PAIN WOMEN EXPERIENCE BUT FELT MORE PERMANENT, AS IF IT WOULD TAKE MORE THAN THE STANDARD IBUPROFEN TO SORT THIS ONE OUT. AT THE SAME TIME AS THE BREAST PAIN, I WAS EXPERIENCING A WEIRD PAIN IN MY RIGHT EYE AREA, LIKE THAT YOU HAVE WHEN SUFFERING SINUSITIS. I WENT TO REST IN MY BED WITH A HOT WATER BOTTLE ON MY CHEST AND THAT DID MANAGE TO SOOTHE THE PAIN SLIGHTLY AND I FELT WELL ENOUGH TO GET OUT OF BED EVEN THOUGH THE PAIN WAS STILL THERE ALBEIT A LOT MORE TOLERABLE. I WENT TO BED AT THE END OF THE DAY AS NORMAL BUT WHEN I WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING I WOKE UP TO THE IRRITATING PAIN AGAIN. IT WAS VIRTUALLY GONE FROM THE LEFT BREAST BUT REMAINED IN THE RIGHT ONE. THE STRANGE EYE PAIN WAS STILL PRESENT TOO AND IF IT WASN'T FOR THIS INFLAMMATORY SENSATION, THE BREAST PAIN ALONE WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT MORE MANAGEABLE. THE SCARIEST THING OF ALL IS THAT THE PAIN NEVER QUITE FELT BIOLOGICAL IN NATURE; IT WAS A WEIRD, FOREIGN, PERSISTENT SENSATION THAT WOULD STAY WITH ME (WITHOUT ANY CHANGE IN PAIN LEVELS) FOR THE NEXT 6 WEEKS. I TRIED THE STANDARD METHODS IN AN ATTEMPT TO ALLEVIATE THE PAIN: PAINKILLERS, MASSAGE, HEAT CREAM, NONE OF WHICH WORKED. THE PAIN DROVE ME MAD AND I STRUGGLED TO CONCENTRATE AT WORK AND IN SOCIAL SETTINGS, ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT WAS THE PAIN WHICH I WAS CONVINCED WOULD NEVER GO AWAY. I MADE AN APPOINTMENT TO SEE MY GP AFTER THE FIRST WEEK OF PAIN AND HE HAD PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE WITH RECONSTRUCTIVE BREAST SURGERY AND DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THE PAIN WAS DUE TO THE IMPLANTS. INTERESTINGLY, I WAS PRESCRIBED MEDICATION FOR HEARTBURN AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALSO OCCURRING AT THE SAME TIME BUT AS THE HEARTBURN DISAPPEARED THE BREAST PAIN REMAINED. IN (B)(6) THIS YEAR, AFTER BEING IN CHRONIC PAIN AND EXPERIENCING BIZARRE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL INCIDENTS FOR 15 MONTHS, I EVENTUALLY MADE A DIFFICULT BUT FIRM DECISION, THE IMPLANTS HAD TO GO. MY EXPLANTATION AND CAPSULECTOMY SURGERY TOOK PLACE ON THE (B)(6) 2015 AND WAS A SUCCESS. MY SURGEON LATER EXPLAINED TO ME THAT THERE WAS SOME DISCOLORATION OF THE BREAST IMPLANTS BUT HE HAD SEEN WORSE. I AM NOW 4 MONTHS OUT FROM THE EXPLANTATION SURGERY AND I TRULY FEEL LIKE I'VE HAD MY LIFE BACK. I'M NO LONGER HURTING, ON EDGE, OR HAVE A CONSTANT SENSE OF FOREBODING OR FEAR. MOST IMPORTANTLY THE BREAST PAIN HAS GONE! I WANTED TO MAKE THE FDA AWARE OF MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF THIS MEDICAL DEVICE. TO THIS DAY I DO NOT KNOW HOW THE SILICONE IMPLANTS CAUSED ALL THESE STRANGE SYMPTOMS, ESPECIALLY THE INCESSANT, DULL ACHE, BUT THEY DID, I AM CERTAIN OF THAT. THE EXPERIENCE I HAD WAS TERRIFYING AND MAY BE I WAS A ONE-OFF CASE BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO BECOME INVOLVED IN ANY FURTHER RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTS OF BREAST IMPLANTS.

5098467|26589688|N|1||(B)(4). BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. THE PATIENT SHOULD BE TOLD THAT THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGE IN THE IMPLANT SHAPE MAY BE SIGNS OF SYMPTOMATIC RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. IF THE PATIENT HAS ANY OF THESE SIGNS, SHE SHOULD BE TOLD TO REPORT THEM AND POSSIBLY HAVE AN MRI EVALUATION TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. LITERATURE REPORTS HAVE ALSO BEEN MADE ASSOCIATING SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS WITH VARIOUS RHEUMATOLOGICAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS SUCH AS FATIGUE, EXHAUSTION, JOINT PAIN AND SWELLING, MUSCLE PAIN AND CRAMPING, TINGLING, NUMBNESS, WEAKNESS, AND SKIN RASHES.|UNK GEL BREAST IMPLANT|UNK GEL BREAST IMPLANT|09/23/2015||||N|R||0HP|FTR|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||NI|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

CALCIUM DEPOSITS CAN FORM IN THE TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT WITH SYMPTOMS THAT MAY INCLUDE PAIN AND FIRMNESS. LYMPHADENOPATHY HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED IN SOME WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS. BASED ON INFO REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGAN'S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERS' BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MUFTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. USE CARE IN SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURES SUCH AS OPEN CAPSULOTOMY, BREAST POCKET REVISION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA ASPIRATION, AND BIOPSY/LUMPECTOMY TO AVOID DAMAGE TO THE IMPLANT SHELL OR VALVE. ANY POSTOPERATIVE EVACUATION OF HEMATOMA OR SEROMA MUST BE CONDUCTED WITH CARE TO AVOID BREAST IMPLANT CONTAMINATION, OR DAMAGE FROM SHARP INSTRUMENTS. THE USE OF MICROWAVE DIATHERMY IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST IMPLANTS IS NOT RECOMMENDED, AS IT HAS BEEN REPORTED TO CAUSE TISSUE NECROSIS, SKIN EROSION, AND EXTRUSION OF THE IMPLANT. ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE IN VIVO EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. PATIENTS SHOULD BE INFORMED THAT DISSATISFACTION WITH COSMETIC RESULTS RELATED TO SUCH THINGS AS SCAR DEFORMITY, HYPERTROPHIC SCARRING, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, INCORRECT SIZE, AND IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY MAY OCCUR. CAREFUL SURGICAL PLANNING AND TECHNIQUE CAN MINIMIZE, BUT NOT PRECLUDE, THE RISK OF SUCH RESULTS. PRE-EXISTING ASYMMETRY MAY NOT BE ENTIRELY CORRECTABLE. REVISION SURGERY MAY BE INDICATED TO MAINTAIN PATIENT SATISFACTION BUT CARRIES ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS AND RISKS.

5092043|26351217|N|1||DEVICE LABELING ADDRESSES: BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.|UNK GEL BREAST IMPLANT|UNK GEL BREAST IMPLANT|09/21/2015||||N|R||0HP|FTR|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||NI|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

THE ABSTRACT OF THIS ARTICLE WAS FIRST RECEIVED ON 11/09/2016. THIS EVENT WAS FIRST RECEIVED IN THE ABSTRACT. FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE AUTHOR REGARDING EVENT, PRODUCT, OR PATIENT DETAILS HAS BEEN REQUESTED. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. DEVICE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. BREAST IMPLANTS RUPTURE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. RUPTURES CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO RUPTURE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, STRESSING THE IMPLANT DURING IMPLANTATION AND WEAKENING IT, FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL, EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED), TRAUMA, COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING, AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF RUPTURE FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT. IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF RUPTURE. LABORATORY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RUPTURE ARE ONGOING. SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE. IF RUPTURE OCCURS, SILICONE GEL MAY EITHER REMAIN WITHIN THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), MOVE OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE (EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), OR MOVE OUTSIDE THE BREAST (GEL MIGRATION). THERE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY THAT RUPTURE MAY PROGRESS FROM INTRACAPSULAR TO EXTRACAPSULAR AND BEYOND."|STYLE 153 SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|UNK STYLE 153|12/02/2016||||N|R||0HP|FTR|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||NI|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM.

DEVICE LABELING: THERE HAVE BEEN CONCERNS RAISED REGARDING POTENTIAL DAMAGING EFFECTS ON CHILDREN BORN OF MOTHERS WITH IMPLANTS. A REVIEW OF THE PUBLISHED LITERATURE ON THIS ISSUE SUGGESTS THAT THE INFORMATION IS INSUFFICIENT TO DRAW DEFINITIVE CONCLUSIONS. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, A SYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE.

FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE AUTHOR REGARDING EVENT, PRODUCT, OR PATIENT DETAILS HAS BEEN REQUESTED. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. DEVICE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. BREAST IMPLANTS RUPTURE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. RUPTURES CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO RUPTURE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, STRESSING THE IMPLANT DURING IMPLANTATION AND WEAKENING IT, FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL, EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED), TRAUMA, COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING, AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF RUPTURE FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT. IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF RUPTURE. LABORATORY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RUPTURE ARE ONGOING. SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SEE TABLE 4 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING MRI SCREENING. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE. IF RUPTURE OCCURS, SILICONE GEL MAY EITHER REMAIN WITHIN THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), MOVE OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE (EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), OR MOVE OUTSIDE THE BREAST (GEL MIGRATION).

5761253|48540699|D|1||I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER IN MY RIGHT BREAST IN (B)(6) 2010. I CONTACTED A BREAST CANCER SURGEON AND SHE TOLD ME I NEEDED TO HAVE A MASTECTOMY SINCE THERE WERE 2 TUMORS IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF MY BREAST. I ALSO CONTACTED A RECONSTRUCTIVE/PLASTIC SURGEON. I AGREED TO HAVE AN IMPLANT PUT IN AT THE SAME TIME AS MY SURGERY. THE PLASTIC SURGEON PUT IN A TISSUE EXPANDER FOR THREE MONTHS AND ON (B)(6) 2011, I HAD AN ALLERGAN TEXTURED BREAST IMPLANT PUT IN. THE STYLE OF THE IMPLANT HAD NOT BEEN APPROVED BY THE FDA YET, SO I SIGNED A CONSENT FORM TO BE PART OF A STUDY. I READ THE AGREEMENT THOROUGHLY AND THERE WERE ONLY TWO POSSIBLE RISKS: INFECTION OR COMPARTMENT CONTRACTURE. THERE WAS NO MENTION OF LYMPHOMA CANCER. APPROXIMATELY 2 YEARS LATER THE FDA APPROVED THIS STYLE IMPLANT AND THE STUDY WAS ENDED. ON (B)(6) 2016 MY RIGHT BREAST BECAME TIGHT AND HARD. IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS IT BECAME LARGER AND LARGER. I CONTACTED MY PLASTIC SURGEON AND SHE ASKED ME TO TAKE A PICTURE OF MY BREAST AND SEND TO HER, SINCE I WAS OUT OF TOWN AT THE TIME. SHE ORDERED AN ANTIBIOTIC AND MADE AN APPOINTMENT FOR ME TO SEE HER THE FOLLOWING WEEK. I WENT TO SEE HER AND SHE TOOK MORE PICTURES AND TOLD ME IT WAS PROBABLY AN INFECTION AND I SHOULD CONTINUE ANTIBIOTIC. MY BREAST GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER AND MY SURGEON DECIDED TO REMOVE MY IMPLANT. DURING THE SURGERY SHE TOOK A TISSUE SAMPLE AND THEN PUT IN A NEW TEXTURED IMPLANT AND CLOSED UP INCISION. ON (B)(6), THE PATHOLOGY REPORT CAME BACK WITH THE DIAGNOSIS OF ALCL. IT WAS CONFIRMED BY A PET CT SCAN. MY SURGEON SAID THAT SHE KNEW THE DOCTOR WHO SPECIALIZED IN ALCL AND THAT HE WAS AT THE (B)(6). MY HUSBAND AND I FLEW TO (B)(6) TO HAVE IMPLANT AND SURROUNDING SCAR TISSUE REMOVED BY THE SURGEONS WHO ARE THE AUTHORITY ON THIS DISEASE. ALSO, THE RESEARCH ON THIS DISEASE IS BEING DONE BY A TEAM THERE. THEY HAVE SEEN MOST OF THE DIAGNOSED CASES IN THE US. I HAD OTHER TESTS DONE THERE: AN ULTRASOUND AND A CHEST X-RAY. I SPOKE WITH THE DOCTOR AND HE TOLD ME THAT THE LYMPHOMA WAS ONLY IN THE FLUID SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT AND NOT IN THE SCAR TISSUE (CAPSULE) OR IN MY LYMPH NODES. I HAD THE SURGERY ON (B)(6) 2016 AND WAS INFORMED THAT ALL OF THE CANCER CELLS WERE REMOVED AND I WAS NOW CANCER FREE. I DECIDED TO HAVE A SMOOTH SILICONE IMPLANT PUT IN DURING THE SURGERY RATHER THAN COME BACK LATER FOR ADDITIONAL RECONSTRUCTION. THE DOCTOR TOLD ME THAT NONE OF THE ALCL CASES HAD EVER INVOLVED A SMOOTH IMPLANT. I ALSO AGREED TO HAVE A PET CT SCAN EVERY 6 MONTHS TO BE SURE THERE WERE NO NEW CANCER CELLS.|NATRELLE TEXTURED BREAST IMPLANT||06/27/2016||||N|*||I|FTR|1.0||BREAST IMPLANT|||||||ALLERGAN|||||||True

FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE AUTHOR REGARDING EVENT, PRODUCT, OR PATIENT DETAILS HAS BEEN REQUESTED. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. DEVICE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. BREAST IMPLANTS RUPTURE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. RUPTURES CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO RUPTURE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, STRESSING THE IMPLANT DURING IMPLANTATION AND WEAKENING IT, FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL, EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED), TRAUMA, COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING, AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF RUPTURE FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT. IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF RUPTURE. LABORATORY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RUPTURE ARE ONGOING. SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SEE TABLE 4 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING MRI SCREENING. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE. IF RUPTURE OCCURS, SILICONE GEL MAY EITHER REMAIN WITHIN THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), MOVE OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE (EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), OR MOVE OUTSIDE THE BREAST (GEL MIGRATION). THERE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY THAT RUPTURE MAY PROGRESS FROM INTRACAPSULAR TO EXTRACAPSULAR AND BEYOND."|STYLE 153 SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|UNK STYLE 153|12/02/2016||||*|*||0HP|FTR|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||NI|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

IN RARE INSTANCES, ACUTE INFECTION MAY OCCUR IN A BREAST WITH IMPLANTS. THE SIGNS OF ACUTE INFECTION INCLUDE ERYTHEMA, TENDERNESS, FLUID ACCUMULATION, PAIN, AND FEVER. VERY RARELY, TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME, A POTENTIALLY LIFE-THREATENING CONDITION, HAS BEEN REPORTED IN WOMEN AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY. IT IS CHARACTERIZED BY SYMPTOMS THAT OCCUR SUDDENLY AND INCLUDE HIGH FEVER (102Â°F, 38.8Â°C OR HIGHER), VOMITING, DIARRHEA, A SUNBURN-LIKE RASH, RED EYES, DIZZINESS, LIGHTHEADEDNESS, MUSCLE ACHES, AND DROPS IN BLOOD PRESSURE, WHICH MAY CAUSE FAINTING. PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED TO CONTACT A PHYSICIAN IMMEDIATELY FOR DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT FOR ANY OF THESE SYMPTOMS.

I GOT BOTOX LAST YEAR AND THIS WAS WHEN I WAS PRETTY SURE IT WAS BOTOX THAT CAUSED MANY OF MY PROBLEMS. I WAS INJECTED BY MY DOCTOR AND I MENTIONED IT TO HIM AT THE TIME OF INJECTION THAT I HAD NOT BEEN FEELING WELL AND THOUGHT THAT THE LAST TIME HE INJECTED ME COULD HAVE MADE ME FEEL SICK, HE REPLIED THAT HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THIS HAPPENING SO I WENT AHEAD AND HAD HIM INJECT ME, NOW I ALSO HAD ANOTHER DOCTOR PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT INJECT ME AND I ALSO TOLD HIM I FELT ILL AND COULD IT BE THE BOTOX? HE ASSURED ME NO WAY. I HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT MY SITUATION MANY TIMES AND FINALLY RECENTLY I AM NOW CONVINCED BOTOX IS THE CULPRIT. THE TIME I HAD MY FIRST ATTACK WHERE I WAS VIOLENTLY ILL WAS LAST YEAR, IT WAS ABOUT 5 DAYS AFTER INJECTION, I WAS JOLTED AWAKE IN MY SLEEP ABOUT 4AM WITH HORRID STOMACH PAINS, DRY HEAVING, ALMOST PASSED OUT, COULD NOT BREATH, THEN MY SIGHT WAS AFFECTED. I FELT AS IF I HAD A STROKE. I DID NOT KNOW REALLY IF IT WAS THE BOTOX UNTIL I SEARCHED AND FOUND MANY PEOPLE BEING ILL AND HAD BEEN FOR YEARS. I HAVE BEEN SICK FOR YEARS BUT WE REALLY NEVER KNEW WHY OTHER THINGS CAME UP WITH DOCTOR'S SUCH AS PMS ENDO, FIBROIDS ETC. MANY MRI'S SCANS ETC. NOW I STOPPED GETTING BOTOX FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS THEN HAD IT AGAIN AND GOT SICK WITH STOMACH INTESTINES ETC. CHALKED IT UP TO MY GALLBLADDER AND HAD IT REMOVED, SO I THINK THIS IS WHAT CAUSED ALL MY PROBLEMS. SO I THOUGHT I WOULD TRY IT AGAIN JUST THIS YEAR IN (B)(6). I GOT HORRIBLY SICK THIS TIME UPPER RESPIRATORY SLIGHT COUGH CHILLS FEVER. THIS CAME ON ABOUT 5 DAYS AFTER AS WELL. I AM HORRIBLY CONSTIPATED AND STOMACH PROBLEMS. MY EYE SIGHT NEVER DID GET BETTER.

FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE AUTHOR REGARDING EVENT, PRODUCT, OR PATIENT DETAILS HAS BEEN REQUESTED. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. DEVICE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. BREAST IMPLANTS RUPTURE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. RUPTURES CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO RUPTURE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, STRESSING THE IMPLANT DURING IMPLANTATION AND WEAKENING IT, FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL, EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED), TRAUMA, COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING, AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF RUPTURE FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT. IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF RUPTURE. LABORATORY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RUPTURE ARE ONGOING. SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SEE TABLE 4 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING MRI SCREENING. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE. IF RUPTURE OCCURS, SILICONE GEL MAY EITHER REMAIN WITHIN THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), MOVE OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE (EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), OR MOVE OUTSIDE THE BREAST (GEL MIGRATION).

THESE EVENTS ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THIS EVENT. DEVICE SERIAL OR LOT NUMBER WAS NOT AVAILABLE. EXACT IMPLANT DATE COULD NOT BE SPECIFIED. THE DEVICE WILL NOT BE RETURNED. DEVICE LABELING ADDRESSES: BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.|UNK SALINE IMPLANT|UNK SALINE IMPLANT|06/15/2016||||N|R||0HP|FWM|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||NI|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

I HAD TO PAY FOR REMOVAL AND TESTING OF IMPLANTS AND TISSUE. THEY FOUND PROPIONIBACTERIUM. THIS BACTERIA DOES NOT SHOW UP ON STANDARD LAB TESTS, AND THE ONLY WAY FOR ME TO TELL OF INFECTION WAS REMOVAL. HERE'S MY STORY, TWO YEARS AGO, ON A BEAUTIFUL, SUNNY (B)(6) DAY, I WOKE UP TO A HUGE LUMP UNDER MY ARMPIT. IT COULD BARELY LIFT MY KIDS WITHOUT EXTREME PAIN.

ONE MONTH LATER, WE WERE SURPRISED TO FIND OUT WE WERE PREGNANT WITH OUR 3RD BABY, OUR SWEET (B)(6). STILL UNSURE WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH MY BODY, THE PAIN AND LUMPS AROUND MY BREASTS AND ARMPITS ONLY INCREASED. ALL OF MY PHYSICIANS AT THIS POINT WERE CLUELESS. THEY CHALKED IT UP TO HORMONES.

THE WOMAN DENIED ANY HISTORY OF BREAST TRAUMA, PRODROMAL ILLNESS, PAIN, PURULENT DRAINAGE, LOCAL SIGN OF INFECTION, NIGHT SWEATS, WEIGHT LOSS, POOR APPETITE OR FEVER. AT PHYSICAL EXAMINATION BREAST ASYMMETRY WAS OBVIOUS. THE RIGHT BREAST WAS SWOLLEN, FIRM AND SENSITIVE TO DEEP PALPATION. THE LEFT BREAST WAS NORMAL. NO SIGN OF LOCAL INFECTION WERE OBSERVED. IN (B)(6) 2015, AN ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA WAS FOUND IN THE PERIPROSTHETIC FLUID AND FIBRINOID DEPOSITS WITHIN THE PERIPROSTHETIC CAPSULE, OF THE RIGHT BREAST. THE LEFT BREAST WAS WITHOUT ANY CLINICAL, LAB, IMAGING OR HISTOPATHOLOGICAL EVIDENCE OF DISEASE. ON (B)(6) 2015, THE PT UNDERWENT BILATERAL TOTAL CAPSULECTOMY AND IMPLANT REMOVAL. NOW, MORE THAN A YEAR AFTER, THE PT IS DISEASE FREE.
