11618|7262|D|1||RPTR'S PAIN IS LOCATED BELOW THE LEFT BREAST IN THE AREA OF A PREVIOUS BREAST AUGMENTATION SCAR. THE PAIN BEGAN ABOUT 12 YRS AGO, WHICH WAS TWO YRS AFTER BILATERAL BREAST AUGMENTATION SURGERY. THIS PAIN IS INTERMITTENT IN NATURE. SHE WILL GO A COUPLE OF YRS WITHOUT HAVING ANY PAIN AND IT NEVER LASTS MORE THAN 20 MINS. SHE DESCRIBES THE PAIN AS VERY SHARP, LOCATED IN THE AREA OF THIS SCAR AND SOMETIMES SHE NOTICES SOME KIND OF A TINGLING FEELING. THE PAIN INTENSITY IS ANYWHERE FROM A SCALE OF 1-10, SOMETIMES THE PAIN IS SO SEVERE SHE STATES THAT IT BRINGS HER TO HER KNEES. SOMETIMES JUST STIMULATION OF SKIN OVER HER POSTERIOR BACK INCREASES THE PAIN OVER THE SCAR. THE PAIN IS AGGRAVATED BY MOBILITY. ROLLING OVER IN BED AGGRAVATES THE PAIN. WHEN THE PAIN IS PRESENT BREATHING OR COUGHING MAKES THE PAIN WORSE. NO POSITIONS OR HEAT OR COLD HELP THE PAIN. SHE HAS BEEN ON NUMEROUS MEDICATIONS INCLUDING NONSTEROIDALS, MOTRIN AND TOLECTIN, THAT HAVE BEEN NO HELP WHATSOEVER. SHE HAD BEEN ON PAMELOR AND TEGRETOL WHICH ALSO HAVE BEEN NO HELP. THE ONLY MEDICATION THAT HAS GIVEN HER ANY HELP IS HYDROCODONE 5 MG QID. SHE STILL HAS THE PAIN WHILE ON THIS MEDICATION BUT IT SORT OF DULLS THE INTENSITY. HER CURRENT MEDICATIONS INCLUDE LIBRIUM 10 MG TID AND SHE IS ON HORMONE REPLACEMENT. THE PLASTIC SURGEON WHO DID THE INTITIAL SURGERY, HAS BEEN SEEING HER FOR THIS PROBLEM AND HAS INJECTED SCAR NUMEROUS TIMES WITH STEROIDS AND HAS DONE INTERCOSTAL BLOCKS. THE INTERCOASTAL BLOCKS SEEM TO HAVE BEEN INEFFECTIVE IN THAT THERE WAS NO NUMBNESS IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE INTERCOSTAL NERVE. BECAUSE OF HER HEALTH INSURANCE THE PLASTIC SURGEON HAD TO DO THESE BLOCKS BEFORE HE COULD RE-OPERATE ON HER. IN 10/91 HE RE-OPERATED ON HER AND FOUND THAT SHE HAD SILICONE LEAKS FROM THE BREAST IMPLANTS AND CAPSULITIS AND HAD SIGNS OF NERVE ENTRAPMENT. HE FIXED ALL THESE PROBLEMS, CLEARED OUT SCAR TISSUE AND PUT IN NEW BREAST IMPLANTS, THIS TIME BELOW THE PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE. SHE HAD NOTICED THAT THE PAIN HAS BEEN NO DIFFERENT SINCE THIS PARTICULAR OPERATION. AN ANESTHESIOLOGIST DID INTERCOASTAL BLOCK ON 7/22/92. SHE HAD NUMBNESS IN THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE NERVE BLOCKS WHICH WERE T6 THROUGH T9 ON THE LEFT, HOWEVER THE PAIN WAS NOT RELIEVED. THE PT STATES THAT THIS PAIN IS CAUSING HER A LOT OF STRESS. RECENTLY SHE HAS BEEN HAVING INCREASED INCIDENTS OF THESE PAINFUL EPISODES THAT SHE THINKS ARE RELATED TO STRESS. EXAM OF HER CHEST WALL REVEALS THE SCAR IS WELL-HEALED. IT IS VERY FLAT, THERE IS NO TENDERNESS ON PALPATION OF THE SCAR. NO SIGNS OF NEUROMAS. PT NOTES THAT THE PAIN WENT COMPLETELY AWAY FOR 7 MONTHS AFTER A TRIAL OF DILANTIN BUT SHE HAD A REACTION OT THE MEDICATION AND COULD NOT CONTINUE IT. DR WAS UNABLE TO REPRODUCE THE PT'S PAIN WITH DEEP PRESSURE, SUPERFICIAL PRESSURE, STROKING OR BRUSHING. HOWEVER, DR COULD REPRODUCE THE PAIN WITH TENS OVER RPTR'S INTERCOSTAL AREA, BOTH ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR. PHYSICAL THERAPY IMPRESSION IS INTERCOSTAL NEURALGIA.

12370|7267|D|1||HAVING HAD A HISTORY OF SEVERE FIBROCYSTIC BREAST DISEASE WITH RECURRENT BREAST BIOPSIES, RPTR WAS ADVISED BY TWO DRS THAT A BILATERAL SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY WITH RECONSTRUCTION WAS APPROPRIATE TREATMENT. BASED ON WHAT INFO WAS AVAILABLE TO HER, THE MEDICAL CONSENSUS AT THE TIME SEEMED TO BE THAT WOMEN WITH THIS PROBLEM HAD A HIGHER RATE OF BREAST CANCER COUPLED WITH A LOWER CURE RATE DUE TO THIS DIFFICULTY OF EARLY DETECTION. RPTR HAD BILATERAL SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY AND RECONSTRUCTION OF THE BREAST WITH  GEL IMPLANTS WITHOUT PATCHES ON 6/12/81 AT AGE 40. WITHIN 3 WKS RPTR COULD DETECT HARDNESS IN BOTH BREASTS. IN LESS THAN SIX MONTHS THESE WERE VERY PAINFUL AND THERE WAS MARKED CAPSULE FORMATION ON BOTH SIDES WITH SOME WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT. THROUGHOUT THIS SIX MONTH PERIOD SHE WAS TOLD TO VIGOROUSLY MASSAGE AND PULL THE IMPLANTS TO THE MIDLINE WHICH SHE DID IN SPITE OF THIS CAUSING FURTHER PAIN AS THE HARDNESS AND DEFORMITY INCREASED. ALSO AT THIS POINT THE LEFT IMPLANT HAD SHIFTED DOWN AND LATERALLY. RPTR WAS TOLD BY DR THAT HE MAY HAVE TO RELEASE THE SCAR SURGICALLY. IT WAS THEN RPTR DECIDED TO GET A SECOND OPINION. IT WAS ONLY THEN RPTR DISCOVERED THAT THE IMPLANTS WERE PLACED SUBMAMMARY NOT SUBPECTORAL AND WOULD HAVE TO BE REMOVED AND NEW IMPLANTS PLACED SUBPECTORALLY. HAVING HAD SEVEN SETS OF IMPLANTS, RPTR WONDERS WHAT THE LEVEL OF SILICONE IN HER BODY WOULD BE IF THERE WAS A TEST TO DETECT THE SUBSTANCE. IN THE ALMOST 13 YRS SINCE HER FIRST BREAST SURGERY AT AGE 40 THERE HAS NOT BEEN ONE DAY THAT SHE HAS BEEN COMPLETELY PAIN-FREE. THE EMOTIONAL SCARRING IS EQUALLY EVIDENT. IN ADDITION TO THE PAIN AND TRAUMA OF FIVE (SOON TO BE SIX) SURGERIES AND THE EVERYDAY PAIN AND DISCOMFORT IN THE BREAST AREA, RPTR HAS SLOWLY DEVELOPED OTHER PROBLEMS THAT SHE FEELS ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THESE IMPLANTS. THESE INCLUDE SEVERE MUSCLE PAIN, NUMBNESS AND TINGLING IN THE EXTREMITIES AND EVER INCREASING JOINT PAIN AND STIFFNESS. BUT BY FAR THE MOST PAINFUL IS A RECURRING RAW FEELING THAT CAN AND DOES APPEAR ON ANY AND ALL PARTS OF HER BODY FOR VERYING LENGTHS OF TIME, SOMETIMES WEEKS. SHE IS CURRENTLY TAKING ORUDIS, A NEWER ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUG AND FLEXERIL, A MUSCLE RELAXANT, WHICH RPTR HAS TAKEN FOR SEVERAL YRS WITH A LIMITED AMOUNT OF SUCCESS.

12576|8814|D|1||"RPTR WAS 43 AT THE TIME OF BILATERAL IMPLANT SURGERY. WITHIN 6 MONTHS, THE SURGEON PERFORMED A CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY ON HER RIGHT BREAST.

SHE WONDERS WHAT LONG-TERM HEALTH PROBLEMS SHE WILL HAVE AND WHAT SHE CAN EXPECT. SHE WAS ASSURED WHEN SHE RECEIVED THE IMPLANTS THAT THEY WERE COMPLETELY SAFE. ANOTHER CONCERN IS THE FACT THAT THE RUPTURE WAS NOT EVIDENT IN THE X-RAY. SHE HAD A CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY. THE PHYSICIAN ATTEMPTED TO CRACK IT BY HAND. HE WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL AND THERE WAS BRUISING AND TORN BREAST TISSUE. THE RIGHT BREAST BECAME INFECTED AFTER THE SURGEON OPERATED ON BOTH IMPLANTS TO RELIEVE THE CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY. EVENTUALLY THE RIGHT IMPLANT WAS REMOVED TO ALLOW THE INFECTION TO HEAL. THE IMPLANT LATER REPLACED, SUB-PECTORALLY. THERE WERE 3 SURGERIES ON HER LEFT BREAST: INITIAL PLACEMENT OF IMPLANT, RELEASE OF CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, AND REMOVAL OF IMPLANT. THERE WERE 7 SURGERIES ON HER RIGHT BREAST FROM THE INITIAL PLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT TO REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT. NIPPLE SENSATION WAS LOST IN BOTH HER BREASTS. THE RIGHT BREAST HAS ALWAYS BEEN SORE TO THE TOUCH, PARTICULARLY IN THE NIPPLE AREA. SHE FREQUENTLY EXPERIENCED A STINGING SENSATION IN THE RIGHT BREAST.

WHEN RPTR'S DISEASE IS ACTIVE SHE SLEEPS ABOUT 14 HRS A DAY. SHE HAD HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE (MEDICATION WAS HCTZ AND CORGARD. DR SAID IT WAS UNUSUAL TO TAKE A PERSON OFF OF HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE MEDS). SHE IS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH HER EYES BECAUSE HER VISION CONSTANTLY CHANGES AND SHE HAS 3 PAIRS OF GLASSES. HER OPHTHAMOLOGIST SAID TO WEAR THE GLASSES SHE CAN SEE WITH EACH DAY. SHE ALSO HAS SWELLING OF HANDS AND FEET, STIFFNESS IN HANDS IN MORNING, SPASTIC COLON, RAYNAUD'S DISEASE IN FEET, STRANGE PAIN IN SCALP, AND SKIN RASHES. WITH A FLARE-UP OF LUPUS SHE CAN HARDLY FUNCTION. SHE HOLDS ON TO THE WALLS, CANNOT GO OUT ALONE, CANNOT DRIVE OR GO TO DR ALONE, CANNOT FOLLOW A STORY ON TV, HER SPEECH IS SLURRED, HER MIND ONLY GOES 1/3 THE USUAL SPEED AND SHE SLEEPS MOST OF THE TIME. SHE FEELS AS IF SHE HAS A TERRIBLE FLU. SHE REQUESTED TO HAVE HER IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED TO WEAR A BRA AS EXTERNAL PROSTHESES. THE BROWN PAPER BAGS THAT THE IMPLANTS WERE IN BECAME OILY. SOMETHING GREY IN COLOR WAS GROWING INSIDE THE IMPLANT AND THERE WAS SOMETHING INSIDE THE IMPLANT THAT LOOKED AND FELT LIKE BIRD SEED. SHE GAVE THE IMPLANTS TO THE DR WHO GAVE THEM TO THE MFR.

ONE WAS IMPLANTED IN MY LEFT BREAST ON 7/6/90 AFTER HAVING CANCER (MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY ON 1/21/92. I HAD INFILTRATING LOBULAR CARCINOMA AND HAD RECONSTRUCTION AT THE SAME TIME WITH A PLASTIC SURGEON WHO HAD DONE WORK PREVIOUSLY ON MY BREASTS. I WAS FITTED WITH A SALINE EXPANDER. THE PLASTIC SURGEON THE VERY NEXT MORNING AT THE HOSP TOLD ME HE THOUGHT IT HAD RUPTURED AND TO CALL HIM TO MAKE A DATE TO HAVE IT REPLACED AT HIS SURGICAL SUITE. I DID...HE REPLACED IT AND I STARTED TO HAVE PROBLEMS...MY BODY WAS REJECTING THE SALINE...KEPT HAVING CONTRACTURES AND STARTED TO RIDE HIGH AND WAS MOVING UPWARDS. WENT BACK TO THE PLASTIC SURGEON AND WE DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITIES AND HE SUGGESTED I HAVE IT REPLACED WITH THE SAME POLYURETHANE IMPLANT WHICH HE HAD PUT IN, ON 7/6/90, RIGHT AND LEFT BREAST AFTER TAKING THE TWO SILICONES OUT FOR THE SAME REASONS. HE SAID THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE THE FORMATION OF THE SCAR TISSUE WITH THE CAPSULAR CONTRACTIONS. THIS IS HOW I WAS GIVEN A POLYURETHANE COATED IMPLANT IN MY LEFT BREAST (CANCER SIDE - MASTECTOMY). HISTORY: IN 1988 WENT TO SEE THIS PLASTIC SURGEON WHO WAS REFERRED TO ME TO SEE IF HE COULD POSSIBLY STITCH BOTH MY BREASTS UP FOR THEY HAD BECOME EMPTY SACS AFTER I STOPPED MENSTRUATING AND HIS SOLUTION WAS TO AUGMENT THEM AND AFTER CONSIDERATION HE DID AND PUT IN TWO SILICONE IMPLANTS. IN TIME THESE STARTED TO GIVE ME PAIN AND HAD CAPSULAR CONTRACTIONS AND THEY STARTED RIDING HIGH AND THEY WERE SO SEVERE THAT HE SUGGESTED THAT WITH HIS PTS WITH THIS PROBLEM HE OPTED FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE SILICONE AND REPLACE THEM WITH 2 POLYURETHANE IMPLANTS WHICH WOULD ADHERE BETTER AND YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SUCH CONTRACTIONS. I DID THIS AND HAD THIS PROCEDURE PERFORMED AT HIS SURGICAL SUITE ON 7/2/90. SEE NOTES AT END OF HISTORY OF IMPLANTS. HAD REGULAR MAMMOGRAMS AND IN THE LATTER PART OF 1991 I WAS FEELING A LUMP IN MY LEFT BREAST EVEN THOUGH THE LATEST MAMMOGRAM DID NOT SHOW ANYTHING. I REQUESTED ANOTHER MAMMOGRAM AT A DIFFERENT LOCATION AND THIS SHOWED NOTHING. ASKED MY DR IF I COULD HAVE A WRITTEN PRESCRIPTION TO HAVE A SONOGRAM PERFORMED AND I DID AND SURE ENOUGH I DID HAVE A LUMP. WENT TO SEE MY PLASTIC SURGEON AND HE REFERRED ME TO THE ONE OF THE FINEST BREAST SURGEONS. WENT TO SEE HIM FIRST OF JANUARY AND HE SCHEDULED ME FOR A BIOPSY ON 1/13/92 AND WHEN WE GOT THE REPORT BACK IT WAS CANCEROUS AND SO I WENT TO SEE HIM THE NEXT DAY AND WE DISCUSSED THE DIFFERENT PROCEDURES, ETC. AND HE BOOKED ME FOR SURGERY ON 1/21/1992. I OPTED FOR A MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY BECAUSE I DID HAVE THE SILICONE IMPLANT IN THE BREAST AND WAS DEVASTED WITH THE FACT THAT I HAD CANCER. I HAD THIS PROCEDURE AND HAD THE SAME PLASTIC SURGEON DO THE RECONSTRUCTION WITH A SALINE EXPANDER. THE VERY NEXT MORNING THE PLASTIC SURGEON TOLD ME AT THE HOSP THAT HE WAS SURE THE SALINE HAD RUPTURED AND TO CALL HIM THE FOLLOWING WEEK TO SET UP AN APPOINTMENT TO REPLACE THE SALINE, WHICH I DID. FOLLOWING THIS SALINE IMPLANT I HAD SEVERE REJECTION AND CONTRACTURES WHICH ONCE AGAIN THE IMPLANT STARTED TO MOVE UPWARDS. WENT BACK TO PLASTIC SURGEON WE DISCUSSED THE PAST IMPLANT HISTORY AND THAT THE POLYURETHANE COATED IMPLANTS SEEM TO BE THE ONLY ONES WHICH WORKED. THAT THIS WOULD BE THE ONLY OPTION BUT THAT I HAD TO SIGN A WAIVER. HE NEVER AT ANY TIME INFORMED ME OF THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OR HEALTH RISK INVOLVED WITH THESE TYPES OF IMPLANTS, BUT I HAD NO INFO FROM THE MFR OR INFO REGARDING THESE IMPLANTS NOR DID I KNOW THAT THE FDA STOPPED THE MFRS FROM MAKING THE POLYURETHANE IMPLANTS UNTIL I REQUEST THE BREAST IMPLANT, 1998 FROM THE FDA. I HAD STARTED TO HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS: SKIN RASHES, ALLERGIES, REDNESS, JOINT SWELLING AND SUSPECTED THAT THIS WAS FROM A SEVERE ALLERGY FROM POLYURETHANE COATING, ITCHNESS WITHIN BREAST ESPECIALLY MY LEFT BREAST (MASTY. BREAST). THIS WENT ON FOR OVER SIX YEARS. WENT FROM DR TO DR TO SPECIALIST BACK TO MY OWN DRS, ONCOLOGIST, INTERNIST, GYN, PLASTIC SURGEON AND GOT NO REAL INFO. ALSO HAD SEVERE PAINS IN BOTH BREASTS, CONTRACTIONS. FINALLY IN JUNE OF 1998 AFTER SEEING 11 DERMATOLOGISTS, 2 ALLERGISTS, ETC., I WENT TO SEE MY ONCOLOGIST AND ASKED FOR AN MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING BREAST TEST AND I HAD ONE DONE ON 7/2/98. RESULTS OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING STATE THAT REACTIVE FLUID CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, AND CONTAINED OTHER INFO. I HAD THESE FAXED TO ALL MY DRS, NO ONE GAVE ME ANY INFO REGARDING THIS MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING TEST. WENT AND SAW DRS ONCE AGAIN! GOT NOWHERE; TOLD THEM I THOUGHT IMPLANTS WERE CAUSE OF MY BEING ILL. RASHES, ALLERGIES ARE WORSE THAN MY RIGHT BREAST ENLARGED TO ABOUT TWO SIZES LARGER, RED RASHES, ITCHY, VEINS POPPING, EXTREME PAIN, FEVER IN LEFT BREAST, AND OTHER SYMPTOMS WERE MISSING IN RIGHT BREAST WHEN I DISCOVERED A LUMP UNDER MY RIGHT ARMPIT. CALLED MY BREAST SURGEON GOT AN APPOINTMENT 10/9/98, AND HE GAVE ME ANTIOBIOTICS BUT GAVE ME AN APPOINTMENT AT HIS MEDICAL SUITE TO HAVE A BIOPSY ON 10/14/98. HE REMOVED MY LYMPH NODE AND AFTER PATHOLOGIST REPORT CAME IN AS BENIGN. OTHER REPORTS WERE NOT IN AND I CALLED TO HAVE THEM FAX THE RESULTS AND IT SHOWED I HAD FOREIGN MATERIAL CONSISTENT WITH SILICONE AND THERE WAS A TAN FLESHY SUBSTANCE IN THE RIGHT AUXILLARY LYMPH NODE AND ALSO GIANT REACTIVE FLUID PRESENT, ETC. I FAXED THIS INFO TO MY ONCOLOGIST, PLASTIC SURGEON, WENT TO SEE THEM BUT NOTHING AS FAR AS WHAT I KNEW WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS AND THEIR CONCLUSIONS. FOUND OUT WHO WAS THE MEDICAL ADVISOR AND DIRECTOR FOR CANCER AT THE HOSP WHERE I RESIDE AND WENT TO SEE A DR ON 12/3/98 WITH MY HISTORY.

I HAD INFILTRATING LOBULAR CARCINOMA AND HAD RECONSTRUCTION AT THE SAME TIME WITH A PLASTIC SURGEON WHO HAD DONE WORK PREVIOUSLY ON MY BREASTS. I WAS FITTED WITH A SALINE EXPANDER. THE PLASTIC SURGEON THE VERY NEXT MORNING AT THE HOSP TOLD ME HE THOUGHT IT HAD RUPTURED AND TO CALL HIM TO MAKE A DATE TO HAVE IT REPLACED AT HIS SURGICAL SUITE. I DID...HE REPLACED IT AND I STARTED TO HAVE PROBLEMS...MY BODY WAS REJECTING THE SALINE...KEPT HAVING CONTRACTURES AND STARTED TO RIDE HIGH AND WAS MOVING UPWARDS. WENT BACK TO THE PLASTIC SURGEON AND WE DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITIES AND HE SUGGESTED I HAVE IT REPLACED WITH THE SAME POLYURETHANE IMPLANT WHICH HE HAD PUT IN, ON 7/6/90, RIGHT AND LEFT BREAST AFTER TAKING THE TWO SILICONES OUT FOR THE SAME REASONS. HE SAID THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE THE FORMATION OF THE SCAR TISSUE WITH THE CAPSULAR CONTRACTIONS. THIS IS HOW I WAS GIVEN A POLYURETHANE COATED IMPLANT IN MY LEFT BREAST (CANCER SIDE - MASTECTOMY). HISTORY: IN 1988 WENT TO SEE THIS PLASTIC SURGEON WHO WAS REFERRED TO ME TO SEE IF HE COULD POSSIBLY STITCH BOTH MY BREASTS UP FOR THEY HAD BECOME EMPTY SACS AFTER I STOPPED MENSTRUATING AND HIS SOLUTION WAS TO AUGMENT THEM AND AFTER CONSIDERATION HE DID AND PUT IN TWO SILICONE IMPLANTS. IN TIME THESE STARTED TO GIVE ME PAIN AND HAD CAPSULAR CONTRACTIONS AND THEY STARTED RIDING HIGH AND THEY WERE SO SEVERE THAT HE SUGGESTED THAT WITH HIS PTS WITH THIS PROBLEM HE OPTED FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE SILICONE AND REPLACE THEM WITH 2 POLYURETHANE IMPLANTS WHICH WOULD ADHERE BETTER AND YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SUCH CONTRACTIONS. I DID THIS AND HAD THIS PROCEDURE PERFORMED AT HIS SURGICAL SUITE ON 7/2/90. SEE NOTES AT END OF HISTORY OF IMPLANTS. HAD REGULAR MAMMOGRAMS AND IN THE LATTER PART OF 1991 I WAS FEELING A LUMP IN MY LEFT BREAST EVEN THOUGH THE LATEST MAMMOGRAM DID NOT SHOW ANYTHING. I REQUESTED ANOTHER MAMMOGRAM AT A DIFFERENT LOCATION AND THIS SHOWED NOTHING. ASKED MY DR IF I COULD HAVE A WRITTEN PRESCRIPTION TO HAVE A SONOGRAM PERFORMED AND I DID AND SURE ENOUGH I DID HAVE A LUMP. WENT TO SEE MY PLASTIC SURGEON AND HE REFERRED ME TO THE ONE OF THE FINEST BREAST SURGEONS. WENT TO SEE HIM FIRST OF JANUARY AND HE SCHEDULED ME FOR A BIOPSY ON 1/13/92 AND WHEN WE GOT THE REPORT BACK IT WAS CANCEROUS AND SO I WENT TO SEE HIM THE NEXT DAY AND WE DISCUSSED THE DIFFERENT PROCEDURES, ETC. AND HE BOOKED ME FOR SURGERY ON 1/21/1992. I OPTED FOR A MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY BECAUSE I DID HAVE THE SILICONE IMPLANT IN THE BREAST AND WAS DEVASTED WITH THE FACT THAT I HAD CANCER. I HAD THIS PROCEDURE AND HAD THE SAME PLASTIC SURGEON DO THE RECONSTRUCTION WITH A SALINE EXPANDER. THE VERY NEXT MORNING THE PLASTIC SURGEON TOLD ME AT THE HOSP THAT HE WAS SURE THE SALINE HAD RUPTURED AND TO CALL HIM THE FOLLOWING WEEK TO SET UP AN APPOINTMENT TO REPLACE THE SALINE, WHICH I DID. FOLLOWING THIS SALINE IMPLANT I HAD SEVERE REJECTION AND CONTRACTURES WHICH ONCE AGAIN THE IMPLANT STARTED TO MOVE UPWARDS. WENT BACK TO PLASTIC SURGEON WE DISCUSSED THE PAST IMPLANT HISTORY AND THAT THE POLYURETHANE COATED IMPLANTS SEEM TO BE THE ONLY ONES WHICH WORKED. THAT THIS WOULD BE THE ONLY OPTION BUT THAT I HAD TO SIGN A WAIVER. HE NEVER AT ANY TIME INFORMED ME OF THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OR HEALTH RISK INVOLVED WITH THESE TYPES OF IMPLANTS, BUT I HAD NO INFO FROM THE MFR OR INFO REGARDING THESE IMPLANTS NOR DID I KNOW THAT THE FDA STOPPED THE MFRS FROM MAKING THE POLYURETHANE IMPLANTS UNTIL I REQUEST THE BREAST IMPLANT, 1998 FROM THE FDA. I HAD STARTED TO HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS: SKIN RASHES, ALLERGIES, REDNESS, JOINT SWELLING AND SUSPECTED THAT THIS WAS FROM A SEVERE ALLERGY FROM POLYURETHANE COATING, ITCHNESS WITHIN BREAST ESPECIALLY MY LEFT BREAST (MASTY. BREAST). THIS WENT ON FOR OVER SIX YEARS. WENT FROM DR TO DR TO SPECIALIST BACK TO MY OWN DRS, ONCOLOGIST, INTERNIST, GYN, PLASTIC SURGEON AND GOT NO REAL INFO. ALSO HAD SEVERE PAINS IN BOTH BREASTS, CONTRACTIONS. FINALLY IN JUNE OF 1998 AFTER SEEING 11 DERMATOLOGISTS, 2 ALLERGISTS, ETC., I WENT TO SEE MY ONCOLOGIST AND ASKED FOR AN MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING BREAST TEST AND I HAD ONE DONE ON 7/2/98. RESULTS OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING STATE THAT REACTIVE FLUID CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, AND CONTAINED OTHER INFO. I HAD THESE FAXED TO ALL MY DRS, NO ONE GAVE ME ANY INFO REGARDING THIS MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING TEST. WENT AND SAW DRS ONCE AGAIN!
