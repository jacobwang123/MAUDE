20211|14895|D|1||BECAUSE OF FIBROCYSTIC DISEASE, RPTR HAD RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY 12/20/76 WITH ANOTHER CO'S IMPLANTS. DUE TO SCAR CONTRACTURE AND TWO UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS AT CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, BOTH IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED AND THE SAME IMPLANTS WERE REINSERTED. IN 1979, THE LEFT IMPLANT WAS REPLACED WITH THIS CO'S DOUBLE LUMEN GEL/SALINE IMPLANT. AFTER EXPLANTATION SURGERY 8/17/94, LAB ANALYSIS REPORT FROM DR WAS OBTAINED EXPLAINING THE PROBLEMS WITH FAILED IMPLANTS. THE DEVICE FROM THE CONTAINER IDENTIFIED AS THE LEFT SIDE WAS EVIDENTLY THE REPLACEMENT FOR A FAILIED IMPLANT FROM THE PREVIOUS SURGERY. IT WAS IDENTIFIED AS A DOUBLE LUMEN CONSISTENT WITH PRODUCTION CIRCA 1977-78. THE CRITERIA OF IDENTIFICATION INCLUDE A LEAF VALVE EXCLUSIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CO'S PRODUCTS. THIS IS NOT A SALINE IMPLANT, IT IS A COMBINATION GEL WITH ADDED SALINE IN A SEPARATE COMPARMENT. THE LEFT IMPLANT HAD PERFORATED INNER AND OUTER SHELLS AND WAS SEVERELY CONTAMINATED BY TISSUE AND POSSIBLY MICRO-ORGANISMS AND THEIR METABOLITES. THE GEL LEAKED PROFUSELY THROUGH MULTIPLE PERFORATIONS. THE GEL WAS ALSO INVASIVE AND OF AN EASILY DISPERSED NATURE. THE LOSS OF GEL PROPERTY (REVERSION FROM A COHESIVE PRODUCT TO AN OIL-LIKE ENTITY) IS A SIGN OF CHEMICAL DEGRADATION. THE CAPSULE RECEIVED IN THE CONTAINER INDICATING THE RIGHT SIDE SHOWS A DISORGANIZED MASS OF TISSUE CONSISTENT WITH SEVERE ADVERSE REACTIONS AND FAILURE OF THE CAPSULE TO CONTAIN THE DEBRIS OF A GROSSLY LEAKING PROSTHESIS. IT ALSO INDICATES MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS AT CLOSED CAPSULOTOMIES AND POSSIBLE INFECTION. NODULAR PORTIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH GRANULOMATOUS MATERIALS FROM A PT WHO RECEIVED MULTIPLE IMPLANTS AND WHERE DEBRIDEMENT OF THE TISSUE (ABLATIVE CAPSULECTOMY) WAS NOT PERFORMED AT THE TIME OF PROSTHESIS REPLACEMENT. THE CAPSULE RECEIVED IN THE CONTAINER INDICATING THE LEFT SIDE WAS EXTENSIVELY CALCIFIED WITH PLAQUE-LIKE ENTITIES. THESE SUGGEST A PROLONGED EXPOSURE TO AGGRESSIVE CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES RESULTING IN NECROSIS AND MINERALIZATION. IT APPEARS MOST PROBLEM THAT THE CAPSULES WERE TRANSPOSED SOME TIME AFTER SURGERY. IN PRINCIPLE, THE CALCIFIED CAPSULE SHOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DOUBLE LUMEN IMPLANT. (ALSO SEE 1005399.)

20210|11245|D|1||BECAUSE OF FIBROCYSTIC DISEASE, RPTR HAD RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY 12/20/76. DUE TO SCAR CONTRACTURE AND TWO UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS AT CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, BOTH IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED AND THE SAME IMPLANTS WERE REINSERTED. IN 1979, THE LEFT IMPLANT WAS REPLACED WITH A DOUBLE LUMEN GEL/SALINE IMPLANT. THE FOLLOWING IS FROM A LABORATORY ANALYSIS REPORT AFTER EXPLANTATION: THE IMPLANTS WERE PERFORATED AT MULTIPLE LOCATIONS. THE RECEIVED ORIGINAL RIGHT SIDE IMPLANT HAD A SEVERELY DEGRADED SHELL AS WELL AS PERFORATIONS BUT IT WAS NOT GROSLY RUPTURED. THE LEFT IMPLANT HAD PERFORATED INNER AND OUTER SHELLS AND WAS SEVERELY CONTAMINATED BY TISSUE AND POSSIBLY MICRO-ORGANISMS AND THEIR METABOLITES. THE GEL LEAKED PROFUSELY THROUGH MULTIPLE PERFORATIONS. THE GEL WAS ALSO INVASIVE AND OF AN EASILY DISPERSED NATURE. THE CAPSULE RECEIVED IN THE CONTAINER INDICATING THE RIGHT SIDE SHOWS A DISORGANIZED MASS OF TISSUE CONSISTENT WITH SEVERE ADVERSE REACTION AND FAILURE OF THE CAPSULE TO CONTAIN THE DEBRIS OF A GROSSLY LEAKING PROSTHESIS. IT ALSO INDICATES MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS AT CLOSED CAPSULOTOMIES AND POSSIBLE INFECTION. NODULAR PORTIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH GRANULOMATOUS MATERIAL AND A PT WHO RECEIVED MULTIPLE IMPLANTS AND WHERE DEBRIDEMENT OF THE TISSUE (ABLATIVE CAPSULECTOMY) WAS NOT PERFORMED AT THE TIME OF PROSTHESIS REPLACEMENT. THE CAPSULE RECEIVED IN THE CONTAINER INDICATING THE LEFT SIDE WAS EXTENSIVELY CALCIFIED WITH PLAQUE-LIKE ENTITIES. THESE SUGGEST A PROLONGED EXPOSURE TO AGGRESSIVE CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES RESULTING IN NECROSIS AND MINERALIZATION. OVERALL IMPRESSIONS SUGGEST, A PT WITH MULTIPLE PROSTHETIC MISADVENTURES AND EXTENSIVE TISSUE DAMAGE IN THE PROSTHETIC AREA IN ADDITION TO POSSIBLE METABOLIC DISTURBANCES AND SYSTEMIC EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH ABSORPTION OF MIXED BIOACTIVE SUBSTANCES ORIGINATING FROM FAULTY BREAST PROSTHESES.
