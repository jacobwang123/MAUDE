NOT ONLY TO MY MALIGNANT TUMOR BUT ALSO TO YELLOW GELATINOUS MATERIAL SURROUNDING MY THYROID GLAND EVEN THOUGH MY MEDICAL RECORDS CLEARLY STATED I HAD HAD A BREAST AUGMENTATION NO ONE AT TIME OF SURGERY MENTIONED PRESENCE OF A FOREIGN BODY MATERIAL FOUND IN MY GLAND MY TUMOR WAS REMOVED YET AN OBVIOUSLY RUPTURED IMPLANT WAS ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN MY BODY FOR SEVERAL MORE YEARS IT IS KNOWN THAT MOST OF MEDICAL COMMUNITY REFUSES TO ADMIT ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS AND DISEASE HOWEVER GIVEN THE PRESENCE OF SILICA THOUGHOUT MY THYROID GLAND AND LYMPH NODES THERE IS NO DOUBT

SURGEON MADE ME PROMISE NOT TO YELL AND B THERE WOULD BE NO ANESTHESIA PROCEDURE WAS INDEED VERY PAINFUL AS HE MANUALLY APPLIED PRESURE TO EACH BREAST AND CRACKED THEM I FELT A TEARING SENSATION AROUND EACH BREAST THIS WAS THE FIRST OF NINE CLOSED CAPSULOTOMIES AND I SUSPECT MY LEFT IMPLANT WAS RUPTURED FROM THE VERY FIRST ONE ONE YEAR AFTER IMPLANTATION I BEGAN TO HAVE PAIN IN JOINTS OF MY

REFERRED NOT ONLY TO MY MALIGNANT TUMOR BUT ALSO TO YELLOW GELATINOUS MATERIAL SURROUNDING MY THYROID GLAND EVEN THOUGH MY MEDICAL RECORDS CLEARLY STATED I HAD HAD A BREAST AUGMENTATION NO ONE AT THE TIME OF SURGERY MENTIONED THE PRESENCE OF A FOREIGN BODY MATERIAL FOUND IN MY GLAND MY TUMOR WAS REMOVED YET AN OBVIOUSLY RUPTURED IMPLANT WAS ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN MY BODY FOR SEVERAL MORE YEARS IT IS KNOWN THAT MOST OF THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY REFUSES TO ADMIT ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS AND DISEASE HOWEVER GIVEN THE PRESENCE OF SILICA THROUGHOUT MY THYROID GLAND AND LYMPH NODES THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND AS TO WHAT CAUSED MY CANCER SIX YEARS AFTER IMPLANTATION MY RASH CONTINUED TO SPREAD MY JOINTS ACHED AND MY LEFT BREAST BECAME PAINFUL AND HOT FEELING MY LEFT NIPPLE ALSO TURNED A DARKER COLOR THAN THE OTHER ONE I FELT FATIGUED AND DISORIENTED MOST OF THE TIME I CONTINUED TO SEEK MEDICAL CARE AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS NO EXPLANATION FOR MY BODY RASH MY PHYSICIANS COULD
