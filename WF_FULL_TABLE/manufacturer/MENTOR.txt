I BELIEVE SINCE I ALREADY HAD AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS I SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAD SILICONE IMPLANTS. I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ULCERATIVE COLITIS BACK IN 1986 SINCE I'VE HAD THE SALINE IMPLANTS REMOVED AND SILICONE REPLACED THEM, I HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY ILL AND NEVER ONCE DID A DOCTOR SUGGEST IT COULD HAVE BEEN FOR MY IMPLANTS. I BELIEVE AS I STATED BEFORE THEY HAVE EXACERBATED MY AUTOIMMUNE CHALLENGES. WITHIN THE PAST 8 MONTHS I HEARD ABOUT BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESS, I DO BELIEVE I SUFFER FROM IT. THE FATIGUE IS DEVASTATING. I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO PUT IT IN WORDS. I AM HOPING I WILL GET BETTER AFTER EXPLANTING. I KNOW MANY WOMEN DO WHETHER THEY HAVE HAD AUTOIMMUNE ILLNESS BEFORE OR NOT! I HAVE BEEN SO SICK I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO TRY GETTING THEM OUT TO SEE IF I HAVE A CHANCE TO GET SOME SORT OF MY LIFE BACK. IMPORTANT INFORMATION: I HAVE CONTINUED TO GET SICKER AND SICKER AND SICKER WITHOUT ANSWERS WITH THIS ""YUCK"" THAT I'M DEALING WITH. I AM ALREADY DISABLED AND WITH THIS IN ADDITION IT'S JUST TOO MUCH I AM DEVASTATED. THIS IS SOCIALLY UNACCEPTABLE BECAUSE I HAVE TO COUGH AND SPIT ALL THE TIME TRYING TO GET THIS EXTREMELY STICKY SUBSTANCE OUT OF MY THROAT. ESOPHAGUS IS WHERE IT IS STUCK, IT TAKES HOURS TO GET THESE DISGUSTING CHUNKS OUT OF MY THROAT AND IT'S EXHAUSTING. I HAVE BEEN TO THE ER SEVERAL TIMES BECAUSE I WAS CHOKING AT THAT TIME I WAS USING A SOLUTION TO HELP CLEAN OUT MY SINUSES, I DON'T REALIZE IT WAS CAUSING ME TO FEEL LIKE I WAS CHOKING EVEN MORE. RX MEDS: I GUESS I WILL LIST ALL THAT ARE PRESCRIBED MANY I HAVE NOT ABLE TO TAKE BECAUSE SADLY I CANNOT AFFORD THEM ANYMORE. I HAVE GONE THROUGH ALL MY SAVINGS TRYING TO GET BETTER!

6653108|77970290|D|1||I HAD MENTOR SMOOTH SALINE FILLED UNDER THE MUSCLE BREAST IMPLANTS. FROM THE MOMENT THEY WERE PUT IN MY BODY, MY IMMUNE SYSTEM REACTED TO EVERYTHING. MY BODY TOOK TWICE AS LONG TO RECOVER FROM SURGERY, CHILDBIRTH, AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. OVER THE 12 YEARS I HAD THEM IN MY BODY. I GRADUALLY LOST THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE. I GREW UP VERY ATHLETIC, SO THIS WAS LIKE DYING. TOWARD THE END OF THE 12 YEARS, I WAS NOT ABLE TO BE ON MY FEET FOR LONG AND NOT ABLE TO WALK OR RUN, OTHER THAN GROCERY SHOPPING AND THE DUTIES OF BEING A MOM. MY EYES WERE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE TO LIGHT AND I HAD TO WEAR SUNGLASSES AT MY DAUGHTER'S BASKETBALL GAME. INSIDE, I WAS CHRONICALLY FATIGUED FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND THE LAST 4 YEARS I HAD TO TAKE A NAP EVERY DAY TO GET THROUGH LIFE. I HAD MANY HEADACHES AND SO MUCH BRAIN FOG THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO DO MY JOB AS AN ACTOR WHO IS SUPPOSED TO MEMORIZE LINES. I SURVIVED BY USING LISTS IN EVERYDAY LIFE. I HAD SO MUCH PAIN THAT IT HURT JUST TO BE ALIVE. MY BODY ACHED ON A DAILY BASIS. ANY TIME I USED ANY JOINT, WHETHER IT WAS MY WRIST ON MY SHOULDER, IT WOULD HURT FOR THE NEXT 5 DAYS. MY FEET WERE CONSTANTLY SORE AND I HAD TO REPLACE MY ARCH SUPPORTS EVERY 30-60 DAYS BECAUSE IT WAS LIKE WALKING ON BONES, MY FOOT DOCTOR SAID MY BOTTOMS OF MY FEET WERE THE THINNEST HE HAD EVER SEEN. I HAD SO MUCH TISSUE AND MUSCLE WASTING AND WEIGHT LOSS. I WENT FROM A (B)(6) MUSCULAR ATHLETIC WOMAN TO A (B)(6) FRAIL WOMAN WHO WAS MALNOURISHED BECAUSE HER BODY NO LONGER HAD THE ABILITY TO ABSORB NUTRIENTS. MY GUT LINING WAS VERY DAMAGED FROM THE HEAVY METALS IN THE LINING OF THE IMPLANTS. ALSO, THE VALVES IN THE IMPLANTS WERE FAULTY AND HAD MOLD IN THEM WHEN THEY WERE REMOVED IN (B)(6) 2016. THIS MOLD CAUSED ME TO BE VERY SICK. MY CHILDREN WERE ALSO HARMED BY THE IMPLANTS WHILE THEY WERE IN UTERUS AND WHILE BREASTFEEDING. THEIR IMMUNE SYSTEMS ARE OVERREACTIVE TO EVERYTHING. THEY HAVE MANY ALLERGIES AND SENSITIVITIES AND HAVE SIMILAR REACTIONS TO THINGS THAT I HAVE REACTIONS TO. THEIR REACTIONS MIMIC MINE SO I KNOW THAT HEAVY METALS AND CHEMICALS HAVE BEEN PASSED THROUGH TO THEM IN UTERO AND WHILE BREASTFEEDING I LOST A LOT OF MY EYELASHES TOWARD THE END, AND MY HAIR THINNED. I HAD FEVER AND CHILLS A LOT TOWARD THE END, AND NIGHT SWEATS. I HAD TO PEE MULTIPLE TIMES DURING THE NIGHT AND ALWAYS FELT THIRSTY. I LOST THE ABILITY TO DIGEST MEAT PROPERLY, AND HAD TO EAT MOSTLY FRUITS, VEGGIES AND BEANS. LIFE BECAME SO DIFFICULT AT TIMES THAT I BECAME SEVERELY DEPRESSED AT ONE POINT. I LOST MY HOPE UNTIL I REALIZED THAT THE ROOT OF ALL OF MY PROBLEMS STARTED WHEN I GOT BREAST IMPLANTS. AS SOON AS I GOT THEM OUT, A YEAR AGO, THE COLOR RETURNED TO MY FACE AND THE JOINT PAIN MOSTLY DISAPPEARED. MY BRAIN FOG IS NEARLY GONE NOW, AND I NO LONGER NEED DAILY NAPS. I AM SLOWLY WORKING BACK INTO EXERCISING AND MY EYES ARE MUCH LESS SENSITIVE TO LIGHT. MY SKIN WAS AGING RAPIDLY THE LAST YEAR, AND NOW THAT THE IMPLANTS ARE OUT, THE AGE SPOTS HAVE LIGHTENED AND I HAVE BEEN COMPLEMENTED ON MY GLOWING SKIN AGAIN. I HAVE PUT ON 5 POUNDS AND CONTINUE TO REGAIN MY MUSCLE AND ATHLETIC ABILITY. I WAS ABLE TO COACH MY DAUGHTER'S BASKETBALL TEAM THIS YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER. I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STAND ON MY FEET FOR THAT LONG BEFORE, WHEN I HAD IMPLANTS. I NOW HAVE HOPE FOR A BEAUTIFUL FUTURE FREE OF PAIN AND FULL OF LOVE WITH MY HUSBAND AND 3 CHILDREN. BREAST IMPLANTS STOLE 12 YEARS OF MY LIFE AND I AM SO UPSET THAT THEY ARE ALLOWED TO BE PUT IN A WOMAN'S BODY. THE DESTRUCTION THEY CAUSE IS NOT OK. THEY SHOULD BE REMOVE FROM ALL SURGERIES. THEY ARE TOXIC IN THE HUMAN BODY AND THEY HARM BABIES IN UTERO AND WHILE BREASTFEEDING. I WILL SPEAK WITH ANYONE ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE. I WANT TO SHARE IT WITH THE WORLD SO NO ONE ELSE HAS TO ENDURE THE PAIN AND SUFFERING THE IMPLANTS HAVE CAUSED TO ME AND MY FAMILY. PLEASE TAKE THEM OFF THE MARKET AND HELP US TO SAVE OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS. THIS NEEDS TO END.

YET, WHEN I SEEK THE CARE OF SPECIALISTS, FEW ARE ABLE TO SET A SOLID DIAGNOSIS AND I ALSO RECEIVED CLASHING DIAGNOSIS WHEN SEEKING SECOND OPINIONS. WHAT THEY ARE CLEAR ABOUT IS THAT I HAVE AUTOIMMUNE/INFLAMMATORY ISSUES IN ADDITION TO MEMORY ISSUES/BRAIN FOG. THESE ISSUES IMPACT DAILY. I HAD MRIS TO CHECK FOR ISSUES WITH NECK- DIAGNOSED AT FIRST AS HERNIATED DISCS BUT THEN AS ARTHRITIS. DUE TO MEMORY ISSUES AND BASED ON DISCLOSURE OF HISTORY ONLY, ONE DOCTOR DIAGNOSED DEMENTIA. ANOTHER SAID I WAS ""AN INTERESTING CASE"" AS TESTS FOR MEMORY MOSTLY SHOWED FAIRLY BAD SHORT TERM MEMORY. MRIS OF BRAIN TO CHECK FOR MEMORY RELATED CAUSES WERE INCONCLUSIVE. ADDITIONAL XRAYS AND A GREAT DEAL OF BLOOD WORK TO DETERMINE ARTHRITIS ISSUES WHICH SEEM TO BE TAKING OVER MY BODY (WAS DIAGNOSED AS RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, BUT MEDICATIONS HAVE NOT HELPED REDUCE THE ISSUES IT CAUSES. PAIN IS INTENSE, PARTICULARLY IN THE MORNINGS OR AFTER SITTING FOR A WHILE. FATIGUE WAS ADDRESSED WITH A SUGGESTION TO GET MORE SLEEP. BREAST PAIN NEAR SITE OF IMPLANTS WAS DISMISSED AND THEN APPEASED BY SUGGESTION TO TAKE BOTH VITAMIN E AND EVENING PRIMROSE OILS (NEITHER HELPED REDUCE PAIN/DISCOMFORT). HUGS HURT. SKIN ISSUES WERE ADDRESSED WITH VARIOUS CREAMS/MEDS, NONE WHICH RESULTED IN IMPROVEMENT."|SMOOTH ROUND MODERATE PLUS PROFILE GEL IMPLANTS||05/21/2017||||Y|I||I|FTR|2.0||SMOOTH ROUND MODERATE PLUS PROFILE GEL IMPLANTS||5905331|||||MENTOR|||||REF 350-3501BC||True

I WAS CONFRONTED WITH A WHOLE HOST OF ISSUES- DEVELOPED HYPOTHYROIDISM, ADRENAL FATIGUE, HORMONAL IMBALANCE, IRREGULAR PERIODS, CANDIDA, 15LB WEIGHT GAIN, FATIGUE, CONSTANT PAIN IN MY CHEST (ESPECIALLY ON THE RT SIDE), ALL OVER MUSCLE SORENESS, JOINT PAIN, HAIR LOSS, HAIR TEXTURE CHANGES, STRANGE RASHES, HEAVY LEGS AND SWELLING, LOW BODY TEMPERATURE, SKIN ELASTICITY CHANGES, CELLULITE, MUSCLE LOSS, BRAIN FOG, MORE FOOD ALLERGIES, IBS, AND A FEW VITAMIN DEFICIENCIES. THE CHANGES I HAVE HAD IN MY BODY IN THE PAST 15 MONTHS HAVE BEEN SO DRASTIC FOR ME. I HAVE SEEN 10 DOCTORS OVER THE PAST 3 YEARS AND I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ""MANAGE,"" BUT MOST OF MY SYMPTOMS REMAIN AT LARGE. THE SYMPTOMS ARE ALL STILL THERE AND THE ISSUES PERSIST DESPITE MEDICATION AND EXTREME LIFESTYLE AND DIET OVERHAUL. SO, I BEGAN MY RESEARCH FOR ANSWERS. MY DIET IS IMPECCABLE, THE PRODUCTS I USE ON MY BODY ARE AS CLEAN AS IT GETS- COMPLETELY 100% ORGANIC, ALL NATURAL, NO PRESERVATIVES, ETC. I AM THE POSTER CHILD OF HEALTHY. I AM AS ACTIVE AS I POSSIBLY CAN BE, BUT LATELY IT HAS BECOME HARD- I AM ALWAYS TIRED! I AM CERTAIN MY BREAST IMPLANTS ARE CAUSING ALL OF MY HEALTH ISSUES."|SMOOTH ROUND MOD GEL IMPLANT||01/29/2017||||Y|*||I|FTR|2.0||BREAST IMPLANTS|||||||MENTOR|||||350-7340MC||True
6386903|69480688|D|1||ONE OF THE FIRST SIGNS THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WAS IN EARLY (B)(6) 2009. I WAS HOSPITALIZED FOR RAPID HEART RATE AND LOW BLOOD PRESSURE. I WAS LATER DIAGNOSED WITH POSTURAL ORTHOSTATIC TACHYCARDIA SYNDROME AND PLACED ON METOPROLOL. I WAS ABLE TO RETURN TO A MOSTLY NORMAL LIFE, ALTHOUGH THE SYMPTOMS NEVER WENT AWAY. FROM THAT TIME ON, I DEVELOPED MORE AND MORE SYMPTOMS THAT PILED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER. THEY RANGED FROM FAIRLY BENIGN TO INCREASINGLY MORE SERIOUS AND PROBLEMATIC. I SUFFERED BOUTS OF VERTIGO; A RASH THAT LEFT PAINFUL SORES, RINGING IN MY EARS, BALANCE ISSUES, BLADDER AND KIDNEY ISSUES, A DIAGNOSIS OF INTERSTITIAL CYSTITIS, MEMORY AND COGNITIVE PROBLEMS, FOOD SENSITIVITIES AND DEBILITATING DIGESTIVE ISSUES, CONSTANT NAUSEA, NEUROLOGICAL ISSUES, TUNNEL VISION, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, HEART PALPITATIONS, DEBILITATING WEAKNESS AND FATIGUE. I GREW INCREASINGLY WEAKER AND MORE ILL. I WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO WORK AND WAS PLACED ON DISABILITY. I BEGAN USING A CANE, THEN A WALKER, AND EVENTUALLY HAD TO BE PUSHED IN A WHEELCHAIR. NO ONE HAD ANY ANSWERS FOR ME. ONE WEEKEND IN EARLY 2014, I TOOK A SEVERE TURN FOR THE WORSE. I COULD NO LONGER GET OUT OF BED AND HAD TO HAVE ASSISTANCE BATHING AND DRESSING. I HAPPENED TO NOTICE THAT ONE OF MY BREAST IMPLANTS (FROM BREAST CANCER IN 2000) HAD GONE FLAT. WE BEGAN TO WONDER IF MY ILLNESS COULD HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH MY IMPLANTS. MY HUSBAND BEGAN TO RESEARCH THAT POSSIBLE RELATIONSHIP. IN (B)(6) 2014, BOTH RUPTURED IMPLANTS, DAMAGED LYMPH NODES, AFFECTED CHEST MUSCLE, AND SURROUNDING TISSUE (TO MY CHEST WALL) WERE REMOVED DURING A 7 HOUR SURGERY. OVER THE PAST 3 YEARS I HAVE SLOWLY BEGUN TO IMPROVE. I CAN WALK SHORT DISTANCES WITH THE USE OF A CANE; I STILL HAVE TO USE AN ELECTRIC SCOOTER OR BE PUSHED IN A WHEELCHAIR IF I HAVE TO STAND FOR LONG OR GO VERY FAR. I STILL HAVE MOST SYMPTOMS, BUT MANY HAVE IMPROVED AT LEAST SLIGHTLY. I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO RETURN TO THE JOB THAT I LOVED. I USED TO BE AN ACTIVE, SOCIAL, HAPPY, HARD-WORKING PERSON. NOW I RARELY LEAVE MY HOUSE - NEVER WITHOUT ASSISTANCE. BESIDES DEVELOPING MULTIPLE FOOD SENSITIVITIES, I HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED AN EXTREME SENSITIVITY TO MOLD AND CHEMICAL EXPOSURE. I FEEL LIKE A VIRTUAL SHELL OF THE PERSON THAT I ONCE WAS. I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING TO HAVE MY LIFE BACK.

6575692|75546313|D|1||MY SITUATION WAS AS SUCH: IN (B)(6) 2015 AFTER BEING DIAGNOSED WITH DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS) FOR A THIRD TIME IN 12 YEARS, I HAD A MASTECTOMY WITH IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION ON MY RIGHT SIDE, WITH A MENTOR GEL-FILLED IMPLANT. WITHIN TWO MONTHS OF MY OPERATION, I HAD AN ODD PERSPIRATION ODOR WHICH REMAINED WITH ME PERMANENTLY. IN THE SPRING OF 2016, I BEGAN FEELING TIRED AFTER MY GYM WORKOUTS, QUITE UNUSUAL AS I HAD ALWAYS EXERCISED REGULARLY, AND I WAS IN PERFECT HEALTH. BY (B)(6) 2016, I BEGAN EXPERIENCING TINGLING AND NUMBNESS IN MY FINGERS, WHICH WAS NOT GOING AWAY. I THEN BEGAN TO HAVE SWOLLEN FINGERS, HANDS AND WRISTS IN (B)(6) OF THE SAME YEAR, WHICH LED TO MY BEING DIAGNOSED WITH CARPEL TUNNEL SYNDROME BY A RHEUMATOLOGIST. THE RHEUMATOLOGIST TOOK BLOOD TESTS AND RESULTS SHOWED I HAD AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE KNOWN AS SCLERODERMA. I WAS SHOCKED AS NOTHING LIKE THIS WAS EVER HEARD OF IN MY FAMILY. I COME FROM A LONG LINE OF HEALTHY PEOPLE WHO MOSTLY LIVE INTO THEIR NINETIES. BY THIS TIME, TOO, I BEGAN FEELING MALAISE, AND I THEN WAS WEAKENED TO THE POINT OF BEING UNABLE TO WALK UNAIDED. FROM THE MIDDLE OF (B)(6)(THE DATE MY PLASTIC SURGEON EXPLANTED THE IMPLANT), I BECAME SO DEBILITATED THAT I COULD NO LONGER WALK. I LOST 20LBS OF MUSCLE DURING THIS ABOVE-NOTED PERIOD, AS MY ARM, LEG AND REAR MUSCLES ATROPHIED, RESULTING IN ME BEING TOTALLY DEBILITATED. I WAS IN EXTREME PAIN, AND I BEGAN LOSING MY HAIR. I COULDNÂ¿T THINK CLEARLY, AND I COULD NOT SLEEP. I SUFFERED FROM EXTREME FATIGUE, AND MY JOINTS WERE SWOLLEN, ESPECIALLY MY RIGHT KNEE. I HAD UPPER BACK AND NECK WEAKNESS. I COULD NOT RAISE MY ARMS, MOVE MY LEGS OR USE MY HANDS. ALL SYMPTOMS STARTED ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF MY BODY, AND WERE MORE SEVERE THAN ON THE LEFT SIDE OF MY BODY. WHEN I TOLD THE RHEUMATOLOGIST ON (B)(6), THAT I HAD AN IMPLANT AND THAT I HAD MADE AN APPOINTMENT TO SEE MY PLASTIC SURGEON THE VERY NEXT DAY SHE SAID, Â¿YOU ARE RIGHT TO MENTION THIS TO ME. AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES ARE OFTEN CAUSED BY EXTERNAL REASONS, AND ARE NOT ALWAYS HEREDITARY.Â¿ IN THIS WAY, SHE CONFIRMED THAT IT COULD BE BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESS THAT I WAS SUFFERING FROM. THE NEXT DAY, MY PLASTIC SURGEON AGREED TO EXPLANT MY MENTOR GEL-FILLED IMPLANT STATING THAT HE COULD NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE IMPLANT WAS CAUSING MY DEBILITATION AND THAT I MIGHT NOT REGAIN MY HEALTH. THE SURGERY WAS ON A THURSDAY MORNING, AND I NEEDED A WHEELCHAIR BY THIS TIME. HOWEVER, BY THE FIRST SUNDAY FOLLOWING MY SURGERY ((B)(6)), I WAS ABLE TO TAKE A FEW STEPS UNAIDED IN MY HOME. TWO WEEKS LATER, I WAS APPROVED BY MY MEDICAL INSURANCE COMPANY TO RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING ASSISTANCE IN MY HOME; PHYSICAL THERAPY, OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY, A PERSONAL AIDE, A NURSE AND A SOCIAL WORKER. I WAS ABLE TO HAVE A VISITING NUN COME ONCE A WEEK ALSO. IT IS NOW (B)(6) 2017 AND I AM ABLE TO WALK AGAIN. I WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE SERVICES FROM THE OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST AND THE SOCIAL WORKER. MY PHYSICAL THERAPIST TOLD ME I MUST MAINTAIN AN EXERCISE PROGRAM THAT HE PRESCRIBED FOR ME. MY PERSONAL AIDE AND THE NURSE HAVE STOPPED COMING NOW AS I AM FINALLY SHOWING SIGNS OF RECOVERY. I CONTINUE TO HAVE SWELLING IN MY HANDS AND WEAKNESS IN MY UPPER ARMS, NECK AND BACK. IT IS QUITE DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT THE MENTOR GEL-FILLED IMPLANT WAS LEECHING OR BLEEDING TOXINS INTO MY BODY TO THE EXTENT THAT I WAS TOTALLY DEBILITATED FOR OVER 10 MONTHS OF MY LIFE. I THANK THE RHEUMATOLOGIST FOR VALIDATING THE FACT THAT THE IMPLANT COULD BE THE CAUSE. I HAVE BEEN ON A DETOX DIET SINCE (B)(6) 2016. I WAS UNABLE TO LEAVE MY HOUSE UNAIDED FROM (B)(6) DUE TO THIS ILLNESS. I ONLY LEFT THE HOUSE FOR DOCTOR APPOINTMENTS. I COULD NOT TAKE MYSELF TO THESE APPOINTMENTS. AT PRESENT, I CANNOT SIT FOR LONG, TIRE EASILY AND CANNOT DRIVE FAR. MY UPPER BODY MUSCLES ACHE, AND I CONTINUE TO HAVE DIFFICULTY SLEEPING.

AN MRI SHOWED THAT THE IMPLANTS WERE NOT GROSSLY LEAKING. A CT SCAN SHOWED TWO LYMPH NODES WHICH WERE 2.5 CM BY 1.6 CM, IN THE LEFT INTERNAL MAMMARY CHAIN. THE RPTR HAD A NEEDLE-DIRECTED CT BIOPSY WHICH SHOWED SILICONE AND GIANT CELLS. THE RPTR WAS INJECTED WITH FLUROINATED GLUCOSE AFTER WHICH A PET SCAN WAS DONE WHICH SHOWED THE TWO LYMPH NODES. THE RPTR IS TO HAVE SURGERY ON 8/15/94, TO DETERMINE IF IT IS ONLY SILICONE IN THE LYMPH NODES OR IF SHE HAS HAD A RECURRENCE OF CANCER. A PET SCAN DEMONSTRATED POSITIVE ACTIVITY IN THE AREAS OF LEFT INTERNAL MAMMARY NODE CHAIN. BUT AGAIN, IT COULD NOT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN NEOPLASTIC AND INFLAMMATORY CHANGE. BECAUSE SILICONE LYMPHADENOPATHY INVOLVING THE INTERNAL MAMMARY NODES HAS NOT BEEN DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY, THESE PATHOLOGIC NODES WERE A POTENTIALLY OMINOUS SIGN REPRESENTING A POSSIBLE RECURRENT BREAST CANCER. TO OVERCOME THE PROBLEM OF SAMPLING ERROR, A COMPLETE EXCISION OF TEH ENTIRE CHAIN OF PATHOLOGIC NODES WOULD BE REQUIRED. THE PT CAME PREPARED TO UNDERGO AN OPEN THORACOTOMY. AFTER EXTENSIVE CONSULTATION WITH SURGICAL ONCOLOGY, THORACIC SURGERY AND PLASTIC SURGERY, THE PT UNDERWENT A SINGLE-STAAGE PROCEDRUE INVOLVING A VIDEOTHORACOSCOPIC EXCISIONAL BIOPSY OF THE ENLARGED CHAIN OF INTERNAL MAMMARY NODES, BILATERAL EXPLANTATION OF THE GEL PROSTHESES, CAPSULECTOMY, AND RECONSTRUCTION USING SALINE-FILLED IMPLANTS. INTRA-OPERATIVELY, GEL ""BLEED"" WAS OBSERVED, ALTHOUGH BOTH IMPLANTS WERE GROSSLY INTACT. THE HISTOLOGIC FINDINGS WERE CONSISTENT WITH A REACTION TO SILICONE COMPOUND. TOUCH PREPARATIONS WERE PLACED ON GLAS SLIDES, AND THE MATERIAL WAS SUBMITTED AND THE MATERIAL WAS DETERMINED BY INFRARED SPECTRAL ANALYSIS TO BE DIMETHYLSILOXANE.

12046|9795|D|1||IN 1986, RPTR WENT TO SEE HER MD WITH THE PROBLEM OF FIBRO-ADENOSIS. THE OPTION OF BREAST IMPLANTS WAS RECOMMENDED. ANOTHER DR WENT OVER THE PROCEDURE WITH RPTR AND HER HUSBAND AT THAT TIME. HE DESCRIBED THE OPERATION AND THE OUTCOME. THE DR SAID SHE WOULD HAVE A TWO INCH SCAR THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE A STRETCH MARK. HER BREASTS WOULD BE LARGER AND FIRMER. HER FUTURE CHANCES OF CANCER WOULD BY 95% AGAINST CANCER. HER MOTHER HAS HAD A MASTECTOMY, SO THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT ADVANTAGE TO HER. QUESTIONS SHE ASKED INCLUDED, SINCE SHE WAS SPORTS ORIENTED, WOULD THESE IMPLANTS BREAK OR LEAK. SHE WAS TOLD THEY WOULD NOT. SHE ALSO ASSUMED THEY WERE FDA APPROVED. SHE HAD NO IDEA THAT A HOSP WOULD PERFORM A PROCEDURE THAT HAD NOT BEEN APPROVED. AFTER DISCUSSING THE PROCEDURE, AND THE POSSIBILITY OF FUTURE CANCER, SHE CHOOSE THE BREAST IMPLANTS. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE OPERATION SHE HAD PROBLEMS. SHE NO LONGER HAD A SEPARATION BETWEEN THE BREASTS. HER BREASTS WERE AND STILL ARE LUMPY. THEY WERE TWO DIFFERENCT SIZES AND STILL ARE. THE SCARS ARE STILL LARGE AND VERY DARK IN COLOR. SHE ALSO HAS ALOT OF PAIN IN HER RIGHT BREAST. COLLAGEN INJECTIONS WERE INJECTED INTO THE SCARS TO LIGHTEN THEM. THIS DID NOT HELP. A SECOND OPERATION WAS PERFORMED TO ADJUST THE LUMPY MASS AND TO SEPARATE THE BREASTS. THE LUMPS ARE STILL PRESENT. THE ORIGINAL IMPLANTS WERE REPLACED BACK INTO HER FOR A SECOND TIME. SHE LATER FOUND OUT THAT THIS PROCEDURE SAVES MONEY BY USING THE SAME IMPLANTS A SECOND TIME. THE BREASTS ARE SEPARATED NOW. SHE WAS TOLD THE SCARS WOULD FADE AND THE PAIN WOULD DECREASE AND TO BE PATIENT. AFTER MORE VISITS SHE WAS TOLD SHE LOOKED FINE. AGAIN, SHE WAS TOLD THE SCARS WOULD FADE AND THE PAIN WOULD DECREASE. SHE WAS TOLD SHE HAD EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS  AND TO SEEK HELP WITH HER EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS DEALING WITH HER BREAST IMPLANTS. SHE WAS TOLD SHE SHOULD BE GLAD THAT SHE WAS ALIVE. THIS STATEMENT ONLY AGITATED HER MORE. EARLY IN 1991 HER MD SENT HER TO ANOTHER DR WHO DID NOT THINK HER BREASTS LOOKED RIGHT EITHER. THE DR DISCUSSED DIFFERENT IMPLANTS, CORRECTING THE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE AND CORRECTING THE SCARS. SHE COULD NOT AFFORD THE COST OF THIS SURGERY. SHE FELT IT WAS A DETERRENT TO GET RID OF HER. SHE CURRENTLY HAS PAIN IN HER BREASTS. THERE IS ALSO A BLUE COLORED AREA IN ONE BREAST. MUSCLE AND JOINT PAIN FOR NO REASON.

ACCORDING TO A MEDICAL AND NEUROLOGIC EVALUATION 1/30/95: PT REPORTS BEING IN HER USUAL EXCELLENT STATE OF MEDICAL, NEUROLOGIC, AND PSYCHIATRIC HEALTH WHEN SHE CONSULTED THE DR FOR COSMETIC AUGMENTATION MAMMOPLASTY WITH INSERTION OF BILATERAL SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS. SHE DEVELOPED SOME IMMEDIATE DECREASED SENSATION IN THE NIPPLES, WHICH WITH TIME CHANGED TO A MILD HYPERSENSITIVITY. OTHERWISE, THERE WERE NO IMMEDIATE COMPLICATIONS FROM THIS SURGERY.

HOWEVER, INSTEAD, BOTH IMPLANTS HARDENED MARKEDLY, ESPECIALLY ON THE RIGHT, AND DID NOT IMPROVE IN PLACEMENT.

SHORTLY THEREAFTER, BOTH IMPLANTS HARDENED, ESPECIALLY ON THE RIGHT, AND SEVERAL CLOSED CAPSULOTOMIES WERE PERFORMED, WHICH EVENTUALLY SOFTENED THE LEFT IMPLANT, BUT COULD NOT EFFECTIVELY SOFTEN THE RIGHT ONE. IN 1978, THE RIGHT IMPLANT AND EXTENSIVE SCAR TISSUE WERE REMOVED AND A NEW IMPLANT PLACED ON THE RIGHT. THIS IMPLANT AGAIN MARKEDLY HARDENED AND WAS REPLACED AGAIN IN 1979, 1982, AND 1982, WITH SEVERE RE-HARDENING AND PAIN EACH TIME. STINGING AND BURNING PAINS IN THE CHEST AND BREAST AREAS PERSISTED.

211895|130455|D|1||"RPTR HAD IMPLANTS PLACED FOR COSMETIC PURPOSES. THE IMPLANTS WERE REPLACED ONCE BILATERALLY, AND RPTR CLAIMS SHE HAS HAD ONE BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY, BEGINNING WITH THE FIRST IMPLANT SURGERY. SHE CURRENTLY DOES NOT HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. RPTR CLAIMS THAT BILATERALLY THE IMPLANTS: RUPTURED, HAD BLEEDING THROUGH THE ENVELOPE, AND WERE ASSOCIATED WITH A SURGICAL AREA INFECTION. RPTR HAD ONE CLOSE CAPSULOTOMY AS TREATMENT FOR ONE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. RPTR CLAIMS TO HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH THE FOLLOWING AFTER IMPLANTATION: BRAIN LESIONS, ANXIETY &/OR DEPRESSION, ORGANIZATIONAL DIFFICULTY, LACK OF CONCENTRATION, SHORT-TERM MEMORY LOSS, MOOD SWINGS, PROCRASTINATION, GETTING LOST OR CONFUSED, ATYPICAL MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS LIKE SYMPTOMS, REDUCED BLOOD FLOW TO BRAIN, INFLAMMATION, ELEVATED CHOLESTEROL OR TRIGLICERIDES, HEAT OR COLD SENSITIVITIES, RAYNAUD'S DISEASE, CHRONIC DIARRHEA &/OR CONSTIPATION, IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME, SUBSTANTIAL HAIR LOSS NOT CONNECTED WITH MEDICATIONS, FREQUENT MIGRAINES/SEVERE HEADACHES, CHEMICALS, CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE, ATYPICAL LUPUS, SJOGREN'S SYNDROME, INFLAMMATION, SWELLING, PAIN/ARTHRALGIA, PERSISTENT JOINT STIFFNESS, CHRONIC UNEXPLAINED MUSCLE SPASMS, FROZEN SHOULDER, MUSCLE PAIN & BURNING, MUSCLE ATROPHY, FIBROMYALGIA, UNEXPLAINED RASHES, SUN SENSITIVITY, UNEXPLAINED SEVERE ITCHING, CHRONIC INSOMNIA, NON-RESTORATIVE SLEEP, CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME, LONG-TERM EXTREME FATIGUE, CLUMSINESS/DROP THINGS, MISJUDGES DISTANCE/RUN INTO OBJECTS. MD REPORT STATES: THE RIGHT SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT APPEARS TO HAVE MAINTAINED ITS STRUCTURAL SHAPE AND ELASTOMER INTEGRITY. UPON CLOSE EXAMINATION THE ELASTOMER SURFACE APPEARS DRY AND DEVOID OF ANY LUSTROUS APPEARANCE. THE SILICONE GEL WAS TRANSPARENT AND COLORLESS, BUT CONTAINED SOME PRECIPITATED PARTICLES. THE NATURE OF THE PRECIPITATED PARTICLES NOTED ABOVE WAS NOT POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED BECAUSE TO DO SO WOULD HAVE REQUIRED DAMAGING THE ELASTOMER MEMBRANE AND RUINING THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE PROSTHETIC DEVICE. NEVERTHELESS, THE PRECIPITATED PARTICLES APPEAR SIMILAR TO AGGREGATES STUDIES IN OTHER RUPTURED DEVICES. MICROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF THESE PARTICLES REVEALS THAT THEY ARE COTTON-LIKE PARACRYSTALLINE FORMATIONS. THESE FORMATIONS WERE FOUND TO BE CHEMICAL RATHER THAN BIOLOGICAL IN ORIGIN. THE LEFT SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT, UNLIKE ITS COUNTERPART, WAS RUPTURED AND SILICONE GEL WAS EXTERNALIZED. THE SILICONE GEL WAS TRANSPARENT, COLORLESS, AND DID NOT CONTAIN ANY AGGREGATED PARTICLES. THE PATHOLOGY SECTION OF THIS REPORT REVEALS THAT CELLULAR REACTIVE CHANGES OCCURRED RESULTING IN THE FORMATION OF A FIBROCONNECTIVE TISSUE CAPSULE. THIS CAPSULE DISPLAYS SIGNS OF CHRONIC INFLAMMATION. IT CONTAINS FOREIGN BODIES IN TISSUE CELLS AND FIBERS. THE SEARCH REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF SILICONE PARTICLES INFILTRATING THE BREAST CAPSULE TISSUE. THE PARTICLES WERE OBSERVED COATING THE WALLS OF THE EXTRACELLULAR SPACES BETWEEN THE TISSUE FIBERS AND CELL PARENCHYMA. THE ENLARGED PRINTS ILLUSTRATE THE SILICONE PARTICLES IN A BRIGHT OFF-WHITE COLOR THAT STANDS OUT AGAINST THE TISSUE AND BACKGROUND WHICH ARE PURPLE AND BLUE, RESPECTIVELY. THE PRESENCE AND LOCATION OF THE SILICONE GEL PARTICLES IN THESE TISSUES INDICATE THAT THEY HAD MIGRATED FROM A RUPTURED AND/OR BLEEDING IMPLANT. THE BREAST TISSUE REACTED TO THEIR PRESENCE BY FRAGMENTING THE EXTRUDED SILICONE GEL INTO MICROSCOPIC PARTICLES AND ENCAPSULATING THEM WITHIN FIBROUS TISSUE. THESE PROCESSES OCCURRED OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME AND DID NOT RESULT FROM ANY SILICONE LEAKAGE/RUPTURE THAT MAY HAVE OCCURRED DURING SURGERY FOR THEIR REMOVAL. GROSS DESCRIPTION: LABELED AS ""RIGHT BREAST IMPLANT"", THIS SPECIMEN CAME IN A PLASTIC CONTAINER INTACT. THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF BLEEDING OR RUPTURE. THE SILICONE GEL IS COLORLESS BUT SOME PRECIPITATE IS NOTICED INSIDE THE GEL. THE IMPLANT CONTAINS 225CC OF FLUID. THE IMPLANT WEIGHS 228.7 GRAMS AND MEASURES 12CM IN DIAMETER. LABELED AS ""LEFT BREAST IMPLANT"", THIS SPECIMEN CAME IN A PLASTIC CONTAINER RUPTURED. THE RUPTURE POINT IS 2CM IN LENGTH AND SILICONE GEL CAN BE SEEN PROTRUDING THROUGH THE ORIFICE. THE GEL IS CLEAR AND NO PRECIPITATE IS NOTICED. THE IMPLANT MEASURES 12.5CM IN DIAMETER AND WEIGHS 226.2 GRAMS. OPERATIVE REPORT: THIS IS A 52 YEAR OLD WHITE FEMALE WHO REQUESTED REMOVAL OF HER BILATERAL BREAST PROSTHESES. THIS PT UNDERWENT SILICONE BREAST AUGMENTATION IN 6/86 AND NOW RELATES A HISTORY OF JOINT PAINS AND RINGING IN HER EARS SINCE 3/92. AT THE TIME OF INITIAL CONSULTATION THE POSSIBILITY OF REPLACING THE IMPLANTS WITH SALINE FILLED PROSTHESES WAS DISCUSSED AND HER HUSBAND APPEARED TO FAVOR THIS. HOWEVER, THE PT WAS ADAMANT THAT SHE WANTED NO IMPLANTS AT ALL AND THEREFORE IT WAS MENTIONED THAT HER BREASTS WOULD BE SOMEWHAT PTOTIC AFTER THE SURGERY. SURGICAL PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION REPORT: THE SPECIMEN IS RECEIVED IN THE FRESH STATE, LABELLED WITH THE PT'S NAME AND ACCESSION NUMBER AS ""SALIVARY GLAND BIOPSY"", AND CONSISTS OF ONE IRREGULAR PIECE OF PINK, TAN, AND RED SOFT TISSUE MEASURING 0.8X 0.7X 0.4CM.

THE SPECIMEN IS RECEIVED IN THE FRESH STATE, LABELLED WITH THE PT'S NAME AND ACCESSION NUMBER AS ""RIGHT OLD BREAST PROSTHESIS"", CONSISTS OF ONE SEMI-TRANSPARENT SYNTHETIC BREAST IMPLANT CONTAINING THE FOLLOWING NUMBERS 225.

RPTR WAS INFORMED THAT THEY COULD BE REPLACED, BUT WASN'T SURE IF THEY WANTED TO GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN ONLY TO HAVE THE SAME THING HAPPEN IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. RPTR DIDN'T SEE WHERE THE PRODUCT WAS ANY DIFFERENT. THE SURGEON SAID THEY WOULD NOT BE HARMFUL IF LEFT IN THE WAY THEY WERE, BUT NEEDLESS TO SAY RPTR WAS VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE RESULTS. RPTR LATER WENT TO TWO OTHER PHYSICIANS WHO RECOMMENDED THAT THEY HAVE THE OLD ONES REMOVED WHETHER REPLACED OR TAKEN OUT. RPTR WAS LED TO BELIEVE THAT MENTOR WOULD PAY A PORTION OF THE EXPENSE OF HAVING THIS SURGERY. THEY HAD BEEN CONTACTED ONE MONTH PRIOR. SO THEY HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO RESPOND. BASED UPON THIS INFO, RPTR HAD THEM REPLACED ONLY TO FIND OUT LATER THAT MENTOR WOULD NOT HELP PAY EXPENSES EVENTHOUGH THEY KNEW THE IMPLANTS HAD COLLAPSED WITHIN A YEAR. RPTR WOULD HAVE MADE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DECISION HAD THEY HAD THIS INFO PRIOR TO THE SURGERY INSTEAD OF BEING TOLD THEY WOULD COVER COSTS AND LATER BACKED DOWN FROM THIS. RPTR FEELS LIKE THEY WERE MISLED, LIED TO AND THAT THEY WERE CERTAINLY FINANCIALLY TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY A LARGE CORP THAT PUTS OUT INFERIOR PRODUCTS THAT WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED AT EXTREME EXPENSE WITHIN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME.

PT HAD SALINE IMPLANTS IN 2001 AND UNTIL THAT DATE PT WAS A HEALTHY, ENERGIZED, AND ACTIVE. PT HAS HAD IMPLANTS PLACED ON 2 OCCASIONS. THE FIRST TIME WAS BECAUSE FROM WHAT THE DR SAID IT APPEARED TO BE HAVING WHAT HE CALLED ""A SLOW LEAK"" WHICH LATER TURNED OUT TO BE WRONG, HE JUST PUT THE WRONG SIZE IN. THEN THE SECOND TIME WAS TO CORRECT THE CAPSULE AND SIZE DIFFERENCE. CAPSULED AFTER THEY WERE REPLACED AGAIN WHICH THE DR APPARENTLY CORRECTED WITH MASSAGES. HOWEVER, IT HAS BEEN OVER A YEAR SINCE THE LAST SET WERE REPLACED AND PT JUST DOESN'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN ANYMORE FOR ADVICE. THE DRS - COSMETIC - PT BELIEVES MOSTLY WANT TO MAKE THE MONEY AND KEEPS GETTING THE WRONG ADVICE. SINCE PT HAS BEEN UNEMPLOYED PT HAS BEEN UNABLE TO AFFORD MEDICAL INSURANCE THEREFORE PT DOESN'T KNOW IF THE PRODUCT IS TO BLAME FOR THE PAIN THEY FEEL THROUGHOUT BODY EVERYDAY. PT HAS SEEN ON TV MANY WOMEN BOTH YOUNG AND OLD WHO HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING ALL THE SYMPTOMS PT IS NOW FEELING, SO PT HAS GROWN GREAT CONCERNS. PT HAS ALSO GONE ONTO MANY FORUMS WHICH WOMEN TALK ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS AS WELL. THEY SAY THEY HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE AND RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT THIS DEBILITATION IS A ""HIDDEN"" SIDE EFFECT TO THE SALINE IMPLANTS THAT NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT. PT IS GOING TO VISIT A DR IN THE NEXT 2 WEEKS WHICH THEY BELIEVE WILL RUN SOME KIND OF TOXIC REPORT TO SEE IF THE IMPLANTS ARE TO BLAME FOR THIS. PT WAS ALREADY DIAGNOSED AS HAVING ARTHRITIS WITHIN ONE YEAR OF FIRST SET OF IMPLANTS. PT HAS TROUBLE HOLDING THE PHONE TO EAR FOR MORE THAN 5 MINUTES WITH HAVING FINGERS CRIPPLE UP. PT'S LEGS HURT ALL THE TIME. PT GETTING EXTREMELY DEPRESSED ABOUT THE PAIN THEY SUFFER EVERYDAY. PT HAS TROUBLE GETTING OUT OF BED. THESE ARE ALL THE SYMPTOMS ALL THE OTHER WOMEN SEEM TO BE COMPLAINING ABOUT AND LIKE PT SAID PT WAS ENERGETIC WHO USED TO WORK OUT AT THE GYM FOR UP TO 2 HOURS A DAY WITH NO PROBLEM AND NOW PT CAN'T EVEN VACUUM FLOORS WITHOUT HURTING.

HE TOLD PT THAT THE SALINES WERE COMPLETELY SAFE AND IN THE ""VERY RARE"" CHANCE THAT THE IMPLANTS WOULD LEAK OR BREAK THAT THE SALT WATER WOULD BE HARMLESSLY ABSORBED INTO BODY. IN 2/1996 PT WENT FOR THEIR FIRST CONSULTATION WITH THE PLASTIC SURGEON. THE ONLY OTHER COMPLICATIONS THAT HE DISCUSSED WITH PT WERE THE NORMAL RISKS WITH SURGERY, INFECTION AND ANESTHESIA PROBLEMS. WHEN PT GOT THE PAPERWORK TO SIGN WITH NUMEROUS OTHER WARNINGS ON IT PT ASKED QUESTIONS AND WAS ASSURED THAT THOSE WERE ONLY BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE SILICONE -- NOT SALINE. THE OPERATION WAS SCHEDUELD. NINE MONTHS LATER HE SCHEDULED PT FOR ANOTHER OPERATION AS PT HAD DEVELOPED CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. THEY BOTH HAD TO BE REMOVED AND REINSERTED. WITH IN A FEW HOURS ONE OF PT'S IMPLANTS HAD COMPLETELY DEFLATED. PT WAS VERY SCARED AND CALLED THEIR PLASTIC SURGEON'S EMERGENCY SERVICE. PT WAS BACK IN FOR SURGERY TO HAVE THE IMPLANT REPLACED. APPARENTLY THE VALVE HAD FAILED AND LEAKED. HE SAID THAT THIS WAS VERY RARE. SHORTLY AFTER THIS PT STARTED HAVING A LOT OF HEADACHES. PT WAS TREATED FOR MIGRAINES AND ALLERGIES. THEN PT STARTED GETTING SEVERE CRAMPING AND MUSCLE SPASMS IN NECK AND SHOULDERS AND HAD TO BE PUT ON MUSCLE RELAXERS. HEALTH GOT WORSE AND WORSE AND PT WAS VERY MUCH IN PAIN MOST OF THE TIME AND EXTREMELY STRESSED OUT. PT SAW NUMEROUS DRS AND WAS TREATED WITH ANTI-DEPRESSANTS AS THEY FELT THE ANXIETY WAS CAUSED BY THE CHRONIC PAIN. EVERY FLU OR VIRUS THAT COMES ALONG, PT GETS IT. THE HEADACHES WERE GETTING WORSE AND PT STARTED SEEING NEUROLOGISTS AND CHIROPRACTORS AND MASSAGE THERAPISTS, AND FINALLY A PAIN MANAGEMENT DR AS A LAST RESORT. THANKFULLY, PT DID MENTION IMPLANTS. HE THEN ASKED IF PT HAD EVER HAD A LEAK. PT STARTED RESEARCHING AND BECAME EXTREMELY TERRIFIED AFTER FINDING SEVERAL DIFFERENT WEB SITES WITH OTHER WOMEN'S BREAST IMPLANT HORROR STORIES. AFTER DOING A LOT OF SOUL SEARCHING AND RESEARCH PT DECIDED TO HAVE THEM REMOVED. PT WENT BACK TO IMPLANTING PLASTIC SURGEON TO ASK HIM TO DO IT. PT MENTIONED ALL OF THE INFO FOUND OUT AND TOLD HIM. THEY DID NOT WANT TO RISK HEALTH ANYMORE. HIS ATTITUDE COMPLETELY CHANGED AT THIS POINT. HE SAID THAT PT NEEDED TO WAIT ANOTHER 6 MONTHS AS HE WAS SURE THAT PT WOULD CHANGE THEIR MIND. PT SAID THAT THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF THEM CHANGING THEIR MIND BUT HE WOULDN'T LISTEN. PT TOLD HIM THAT THEY WERE SCARED AND WOULD GLADLY PAY FOR THE OPERATION. PT WASN'T ASKING FOR A FREEBIE. HE TREATED PT HORRIBLY SAYING THAT PT NEEDED TO BE TESTED FOR CANCER AND OTHER DISEASES AS ILLNESSES WERE PROBABLY FROM ONE OF THOSE AND HE COULDN'T OPERATE IF PT HAD CANCER. PT ASSURED HIM SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE CONVERSATION THAT THEY WOULD HAVE ALL OF THE TESTS PERFORMED THAT HE FELT NECESSARY TO RULE THOSE OUT FIRST. AT THIS POINT IN HIS OFFICE PT STARTED CRYING AND BEGGING HIM TO PLEASE PUT THEM ON HIS SCHEDULE AS HE IS PRETTY BOOKED ALL OF THE TIME AND IN THE MEANTIME PT WOULD HAVE ALL OF THE TESTING DONE HE NEEDED. HE WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM WHILE PT WAS TALKING TO HIM. PT HAD ANOTHER APPOINTMENT WITH A DIFFERENT DR. UPON SEEING HIM HE AGREED TO REMOVE THEM BASED ON PT'S FINDINGS AND SCHEDULED OPERATION.

723841|453468|D|1||I HAD SALINE IMPLANTS FIRST PUT IN BACK IN 1997. I WAS HEALTHY AND ACTIVE. THREE MONTHS AFTER MY SON'S BIRTH ONE OF THEM RUPTURED. I FIRST NOTICED (DURING A BUSINESS MEETING) SEVERE PAIN RADIATING FROM MY CHEST UP THROUGH MY SHOULDER. THE NEXT MORNING WHEN I LOOKED AT MYSELF IN THE MIRROR IT WAS OBVIOUS WHAT HAD HAPPENED. I WENT TO MY PLASTIC SURGEON'S OFFICE, AND WAS TOLD THAT I SHOULD HAVE NO PAIN, AND IT MUST NOT BE RELATED. THE PLASTIC SURGEON'S OFFICE TREATED ME POORLY, AND ENDED UP REPLACING THE IMPLANTS. MY HEALTH HAS BEEN TERRIBLE EVER SINCE. I HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH FIBROMYALGIA ALONG WITH A HOST OF OTHER ILLNESSES AND DISEASES. IN 2005 THE LEFT SIDE AGAIN RUPTURED. I WENT TO ANOTHER PLASTIC SURGEON WHO REPLACED THEM ONCE AGAIN. I AM STILL EXTREMELY ILL, AND I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THE IMPLANT RUPTURE CAUSED MY HEALTH TO SNOWBALL. PLASTIC SURGEONS HAVE TOLD ME THAT MY BREASTS WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD IF MY BODY WAS REJECTING THEM, OR IF MY BODY WAS ALLERGIC TO THEM, THEY WOULD BE HARD. I NOW DO NOT BELIEVE THIS ONE BIT. I JUST WANT THEM OUT OF MY BODY AT THIS POINT.

RESULTS FROM A COMPLAINT DATABASE QUERY OF LOT NUMBER 1006024 WERE REVIEWED. THIS HAS BEEN THE ONLY REPORTED COMPLAINT AGAINST THIS LOT. PER THE HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENT, INVESTIGATION INTO THIS COMPLAINT DETERMINED THAT THIS EVENT DOES NOT POSE A RISK TO HEALTH FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: THERE WAS NO PT CONTACT. THE DISCREPANCY WAS NOTED IMMEDIATELY UPON OPENING OF THE OUTER BOX. THERE WAS NO REPORTED INCREASE IN OPERATING/ANESTHESIA TIME AS A RESULT OF THIS EVENT.

OVER THE YEARS, I WAS BECOMING SICK WITH FATIGUE, PAIN, ARRHYTHMIA. I HAVE BEEN TO MANY, MANY DOCTORS. I HAVE EVERYTHING TESTED. ALL TESTS COME UP NEGATIVE. IN 2006, I STARTED TO FEEL VERY ILL. I FELT AS THOUGH MY BODY WAS SHUTTING DOWN. I WAS SPENDING MOST OF MY DAYS OFF FROM WORK IN BED. A NEW DR FOUND A VERY HIGH ANA. I WAS SENT TO A RHEUMATOLOGIST. BY THAT TIME I HAD COMPLETE NUMBNESS DOWN THE LEFT SIDE OF MY BODY. CHEST WALL PAIN AND BURNING, COMPLETE BODY PAIN AND STIFFNESS. I COULD NO LONGER STAND UP. EVERY POSSIBLE TEST CAME BACK NEGATIVE. I WAS TOLD MY IMPLANTS MIGHT BE THE PROBLEM. I DID RESEARCH. I FOUND ALL KINDS OF HEALTH CLAIMS, ALL SYMPTOMS MATCHED MINE. I SPOKE TO A DR WHO TOLD ME IF I DID NOT TAKE MY IMPLANTS OUT, I COULD DIE. LATE IN THE SAME YEAR, I WAS EXPLAINED. MY IMPLANTS CAME OUT COMPLETELY BLACK. I HAD THEM TESTED AND FUNGUS WAS FOUND IN THEM. I HAVE READ THAT MENTOR WAS AWARE OF THESE ISSUES WITH SALINE IMPLANTS. WHY WASN'T I EVER NOTIFIED!? WHEN THERE IS A DEFECT ON AN AUTOMOBILE, YOU GET A RECALL NOTICE. THIS IS MY HEALTH. IT IS NOW IN 2007, AND I AM STILL NOT WELL. I SPENT SEVEN MONTHS IN BED DEATHLY ILL. MANY SYMPTOMS HAVE ABATED BUT I AM STILL VERY SICK. I NO LONGER HAVE NUMBNESS, CHEST WALL BURNING, BREAST PAIN, BURNING SCALP, EXTREME NERVOUSNESS, OR RACING HEART. BUT, I AM STILL VERY WEAK, OVERALL FEELING OF BEING SICK, PAIN ALL OVER MY BODY, AND STIFFNESS. I HAVE NEVER BEEN SICK BEFORE IMPLANTS IN MY LIFE. I HAVE ALWAYS LED AN EXTREMELY ACTIVE AND HEALTHY LIFESTYLE. I KNOW THERE IS NO TEST TO PROVE THAT MY IMPLANTS MADE ME SICK. BUT, I KNOW THAT THEY DID! I AM BEGGING YOU, THE FDA, TO URGE THAT MORE TESTING BE DONE IN THESE IMPLANTS!!! I WORK IN A BUSINESS HERE SO MANY AT A YOUNG AGE ARE IMPLANTING THEMSELVES BELIEVING THAT THERE ARE NO HEALTH RISKS INVOLVED. WHEN WILL IT BE ILLEGAL FOR SURGEONS TO NOT DIVULGE PERTINENT INFO TO A PT, SO THEY CAN MAKE AN INFORMED CHOICE. WHERE DOES THE FDA'S RESPONSIBILITY LIE IN PROTECTING THE CONSUMER? HOW MANY HAVE TO BECOME SICK FOR THINGS TO CHANGE? I HAVE BEEN TO SURGEONS WHO DO ADMIT THAT MANY HAVE BECOME ILL FROM BREAST IMPLANTS.

THE DEVICE WAS FOUND TO BE INTACT WITH NO ANOMALIES. BASED ON THE INFO PROVIDED, PE CONCLUDED THE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IN THE PT'S BREASTS WAS THE RESULT OF THE BODY'S INDIVIDUAL PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE TO THE IMPLANTATION OF A FOREIGN OBJECT IN SOFT TISSUE. THE SEVERITY OF THIS CONDITION VARIES WITH EACH INDIVIDUAL. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE CAN MAKE THE BREAST HARDER AND FIRMER THAN DESIRABLE WHICH MAY RESULT IN BREAST ASYMMETRY, DISCOMFORT OR PAIN. THIS CONDITION HAS ALSO BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH DEVICE DEFLATION, WRINKLING AND/OR DISPLACEMENT OF THE PROSTHESIS. CONCERN OVER THE ASSOCIATION OF BREAST IMPLANTS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AUTOIMMUNE OR CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASES, SUCH AS LUPUS, SCLERODERMA, OR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, WAS RAISED BECAUSE OF CASES REPORTED IN THE LITERATURE WITH SMALL NUMBERS OF WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS.

1018981|825921|D|1||"IN 2008, A FEMALE PATIENT WAS SCHEDULED FOR BREAST RECONSTRUCTION SURGERY AT CAPE COD HOSPITAL. PRIOR TO THE SURGERY, MENTOR SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS AND SIZERS WERE ORDERED AND SHIPPED TO CAPE COD HOSPITAL. THE IMPLANTS AND SIZERS ARRIVED IN THE SAME SHIPPING BOX; EACH IN THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL BOXES WRAPPED IN PLASTIC. PRIOR TO THE SURGICAL CASE STARTING ON THE SAME DAY, THE CIRCULATING NURSE RETRIEVED THE IMPLANTS AND SIZERS FROM THE STORAGE AREA AND BROUGHT THEM INTO THE OR ROOM. WHEN THE SURGEON REQUESTED A PARTICULAR SIZER, THE CIRCULATING NURSE REMOVED IT FROM THE BOX AND TRANSFERRED IT ONTO THE SURGICAL FIELD. THE SURGEON PLACED THE SIZER INTO THE PATIENT. THE TRANSFER OF THE SIZER ONTO THE SURGICAL FIELD HAD BEEN SOME WHAT DIFFICULT AND PROMPTED THE CRNA TO QUESTION WHETHER THE SIZER WAS STERILE. THE CRNA HAD A PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE AT ANOTHER FACILITY WHERE A NON STERILE SIZER WAS USED. THE TRASH WAS CHECKED AND THE SIZER BOX WAS INSPECTED. STAFF THEN SAW A SMALL TRIANGLE ON THE BOX 6.5 X 2.5 LABEL ( ON THE SIDE OF THE BOX) THAT STATED PRODUCT WAS NON-STERILE. THE SIZER WAS REMOVED FROM THE PATIENT AND THE AREA WAS IRRIGATED WITH SALINE AND NEOBACIN. ACCORDING TO THE SURGEON, THE PATIENT HAS NOT EXPERIENCED ANY COMPLICATIONS FROM HER SURGERY. THIS EVENT PROMPTED A MULTIDISCIPLINARY REVIEW. AS A RESULT OF OUR REVIEW, WE WILL BE EVALUATING OUR OWN INTERNAL SYSTEMS TO ENSURE THAT NON-STERILE PRODUCTS LIKE THIS ARE INTERCEPTED PRIOR TO BEING BROUGHT INTO THE OR. WE ALSO IDENTIFIED SEVERAL ISSUES RELATED TO THE PACKAGING/LABELING OF THE PRODUCT THAT WE FEEL CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENT: STERILE IMPLANTS AND UNSTERILE SIZERS WERE PACKAGED IN IDENTICAL BOXES AND WRAPPED IN PLASTIC. THE WORDS ""NON-STERILE"" WERE ON THE SIZER LABEL IN SMALL FONT ON TWO DIFFERENT LINES (THE CIRCULATING NURSE MOST LIKELY MADE A PATTERN MAPPING ERROR WHEN SHE EXPECTED BOTH PRODUCTS TO BE STERILE AND SAW ONLY THE WORD STERILE ON THE EXTERNAL PACKAGE). SEE ATTACHED PICTURE OF LABEL. ANOTHER PATTERN-MAPPING ERROR MOST LIKELY OCCURRED WHEN THE CIRCULATING NURSE EXPECTED THE SIZER TO BE STERILE AND SAW THAT THE PRODUCT WAS PEEL PACKED - TYPICAL FOR STERILE PRODUCTS. THE CRNA REMEMBERED A SIMILAR INCIDENT AT ANOTHER FACILITY WHERE THE SIZER USED WAS NOT STERILE - INDICATING THAT OUR EVENT WAS NOT AN ISOLATED CASE. WE HAVE RECOMMENDED TO MENTOR CORPORATION THEY UNDERTAKE A REVIEW OF THE PACKAGING AND LABELING OF THE NON-STERILE SIZERS AND MAKE CHANGES TO ASSIST END USERS IN READILY AND CLEARLY IDENTIFYING THE PRODUCT AS NON-STERILE."|MEMORY GEL||03/25/2008|B|||Y||987362.0|0HP|FTR|1.0||BREAST IMPLANT SIZER|N||||IRVING|US|MENTOR CORPORATION||TX|75038||||True

2264070|2198895|D|1||"(B)(6), 2011. RE: BREAST IMPLANT RUPTURE ((B)(6)-2011) - (B)(6). (B)(6). I HAD MENTOR BREAST IMPLANTS ON (B)(6)-2002 BY DR. (B)(6). AROUND (B)(6) 2011, I NOTICED THAT MY RIGHT BREAST SEEMED TO BE GETTING SMALLER. THEN ON (B)(6)-2011, I BEGAN TO HAVE PAIN AND COULD FEEL LUMPS IN THE RIGHT BREAST, SO I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH DR. (B)(6) FOR THE NEXT DAY (B)(6)-2011. ON THAT DAY DR. (B)(6) AFTER EXAMINATION SCHEDULED ME FOR A 7:00AM OPERATION ON SATURDAY (B)(6)-2011 BECAUSE THE RIGHT BREAST WAS RUPTURED AND HE WAS VERY CONCERNED. DR. (B)(6) FELT THE URGENCY TO PERFORM THE OPERATION ONLY 2 DAYS AFTER INITIAL VISIT (PLEASE NOTE: HIS CONCERN WAS URGENT ENOUGH THAT HE PERFORMED THE SURGERY ON SATURDAY WHEN THE OPERATING ROOM IS NOT NORMALLY IN USE). DUE TO THE SEVERITY OF THE RUPTURE, I DID NOT HAVE TIME TO CONTACT DR. (B)(6) TO CONFIRM WHAT TYPE IMPLANTS HE INITIALLY INSTALLED. WHEN DR. (B)(6) OPENED MY CHEST CAVITY TO VIEW THE IMPLANT, HE STATED IN HIS REPORT THAT THERE WAS NO MANUFACTURER NAME NOR SERIAL NUMBER ON THE IMPLANT. THEREFORE, DR. (B)(6) IMPLANTED WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE CLOSEST TO PRODUCT CURRENTLY USED. HAD WE KNOWN THE PRODUCT WAS MENTOR AND HAD WE BEEN GIVEN ANY WARRANTY INFORMATION FROM DR. (B)(6), WE CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE USED MENTOR PRODUCTS FOR REPLACEMENT. NO WARRANTY INFORMATION WAS GIVEN TO US OR EVEN MENTIONED TO CHECK THE MENTOR WEBSITE BY DR. (B)(6). I HAD NO IDEA THAT BREAST IMPLANTS OFFERED LIMITED WARRANTIES UNTIL DR. (B)(6) MENTIONED THAT I SHOULD CONTACT MENTOR TO GET MY WARRANTIED PRODUCT CLAIM STARTED. PLEASE NOTE REPORT OF OPERATION FROM DR. (B)(6) WAS FAXED TO ME ON (B)(6)-2011. DR. (B)(6) RECORDED THE FOLLOWING IN HIS NOTES: RUPTURED RIGHT BREAST IMPLANT WITH SEVERE CALCIFICATION OF RIGHT BREAST CAPSULE, WHICH WAS REMOVED. LEFT BREAST WAS ALSO REMOVED AND REPLACED, AND IT WAS NOTED THAT IT WAS A 275CC IMPLANT FILLED TO 301CC, AND NEITHER IMPLANT HAD A SERIAL NUMBER. DUE TO THE RUPTURING OF THE IMPLANT AND THE CALCIFICATION ON THE RIGHT BREAST, I AM CONCERNED ABOUT MY FUTURE HEALTH AND MEDICAL ISSUES FROM THE RUPTURED IMPLANT. IN ADDITION, I AM VERY CONCERNED BY THE FACT THAT NO MANUFACTURER NAME OR SERIAL NUMBER WAS ON EITHER IMPLANT, AS I NOW UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS THE INFORMATION UTILIZED FOR RECALL PURPOSES. I HAVE CONSULTED YOUR MENTOR WEBSITE WARRANTY INFORMATION, WHICH STATES, ""THE FIRST BREAST IMPLANT MANUFACTURER IN THE INDUSTRY TO OFFER A LIMITED WARRANTY ON ALL OUR BREAST IMPLANTS,"" AND FURTHER STATES, ""ALL MENTOR BREAST IMPLANTS COME WITH A FREE, LIMITED WARRANTY PROGRAM THAT OFFERS LIFETIME PRODUCT REPLACEMENT AND LIMITED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IF NEEDED. BECAUSE YOUR PEACE OF MIND COMES FIRST."" I HAVE ALSO CONSULTED THE WEBSITE OF DR. (B)(6) FROM THE (B)(6). THE WEBSITE HAS A BREAST IMPLANT OFFER FOR (B)(6) 2011. HIS PARTICULAR AD STATES IN PART, ""MANUFACTURERS (MENTOR AND ALLERGAN) OFFER A LIFETIME WARRANTY ON THEIR IMPLANTS IN THE EVENT OF IMPLANT RUPTURE. AND, IF THE RUPTURE OCCURS WITHIN THE FIRST 10 YEARS OF IMPLANTATION, BOTH (MENTOR AND ALLERGAN) OFFER A FINANCIAL WARRANTY OF (B)(6)."" WHEN I SPOKE TO A MENTOR REPRESENTATIVE ON THE PHONE SHORTLY AFTER MY RETURN HOME FROM SURGERY, I WAS TOLD MY SPECIFIC IMPLANTS HAD NO WARRANTY. I QUESTIONED WHY THERE WERE NO SERIAL NUMBERS OR THE MENTOR BRAND NAME ON EITHER IMPLANT, AND ASKED THE REPRESENTATIVE, ""ISN'T THIS INFORMATION NEEDED AND USED FOR RECALLS?"" SHE ABRUPTLY INFORMED ME, ""THAT THE IMPLANTS IN QUESTION HAD NEVER HAD A RECALL."" OTHER THAN THE YEAR AND DATE OF INSTALLATION ((B)(6)-2002) THE REPRESENTATIVE HAD NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO REFERENCE WHETHER THERE HAD BEEN A RECALL MADE ON THIS IMPLANT PRODUCT. I AM REQUESTING THAT MENTOR DO THE FOLLOWING TO HONOR THEIR WRITTEN, STATED WARRANTY. REIMBURSE ME THE COST OF THE IMPLANTS SINCE THERE WAS NO BRAND DESCRIPTION OR SERIAL NUMBER ON THE ORIGINAL PRODUCT AND SINCE THE URGENCY OF THE RUPTURE LEFT NO TIME FOR ME TO CONTACT THE ORIGINAL PHYSICIAN, DR.

1998794|20917661|D|1||I HAVE SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS AFTER HAVING RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY FOLLOWING A BREAST CANCER BILATERAL MASTECTOMY. AT THE END OF (B)(6) 2010, I VISITED (B)(6). THE WEATHER WAS EXTREMELY COLD, -16 DEGREES IN THE EVENINGS. AS THE DRIVE INTO THE MOUNTAINS CLIMBED IN ELEVATION FROM (B)(6), I BEGAN TO HAVE SHALLOW BREATHING. I REMAINED CLAM AND KEPT MY BREATHING SLOW TO AVOID PANIC. WHEN I GOT OUT OF THE CAR, MY MOVEMENTS WERE EXTREMELY SLOW AND RESTRICTED. I FELT IT NECESSARY TO PAY ATTENTION TO MY BREATH, THE SHALLOWNESS WAS VERY PRESENT WITH HEAVINESS IN MY CHEST, AND I COULD NOT FILL MY LUNGS AS I NORMALLY COULD. THROUGHOUT THE NEXT TWO DAYS, I WAS RESTRICTED IN MOVEMENT IN THAT I COULD NOT BREATHE TO COMPLETE NORMAL DAILY TASKS. WALKING ACROSS THE ROOM CAUSED ME TO STOP AND CATCH MY BREATH. MY FAMILY AND I TREATED THIS SYMPTOM AS ALTITUDE SICKNESS. I HAVE NEVER HAD ALTITUDE SICKNESS WITH ANY PRIOR VISITS TO (B)(6). MY LAST VISIT WAS (B)(6) 2010 WITH NO SYMPTOMS WHAT SO EVER. I CONTEMPLATED, MANY TIMES, IF I SHOULD GO TO THE ER BUT KEPT FAITH IN THAT IT WOULD SUBSIDE BY DRINKING WATER AS IF IT REALLY WERE ALTITUDE SICKNESS. AS INTENSE HEADACHE DEVELOPED THAT ENVELOPED MY ENTIRE CRANIUM. I DO NOT HAVE ISSUES WITH HEADACHES, CERTAINLY NOT ONE THIS INTENSE. I FELT HANDICAPPED. I AM NOT HANDICAPPED. I AM A NORMALLY FUNCTIONING HEALTHY CAPABLE WOMAN WHOSE BREATH WAS COMPROMISED BY PRESSURE IN THE CHEST. MY IMPLANTS WERE TIGHTER THAN NORMAL, LARGER AS IF THEY WERE SWOLLEN. ON THE DRIVE BACK TO (B)(6), THERE WAS A POINT WHERE MY BREATH RETURNED TO NORMAL. IT WAS ABOUT THE SAME AREA WHERE IT WAS SHORTENED ON THE WAY UP. TO SAY I WAS RELIEVED I COULD BREATHE NORMALLY AGAIN IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. A SHORT WHILE LATER, I NOTICED A LOUD SLOSHING SOUND IN MY IMPLANTS. THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED SINCE THEY WERE PUT IN (B)(6) 2007. THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT WOULD RESULT IN A LOUD PROMINENT SLOSHING SOUND THAT COULD BE HEARD BY OTHERS IN THE ROOM. THEIR FORM REMAINED NORMAL. I COULDN'T TELL IF THE NOISE WAS COMING FROM INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF THE IMPLANT. THE SKIN AROUND THE IMPLANT SEEMED NORMAL AS WELL. I WAS UP ALL NIGHT EVALUATING IF THEY WERE LEAKING OR NOT. I FOUND IT ODD THAT THEY WOULD BOTH LEAK BUT THE NOISES CAME EQUALLY FROM BOTH SIDES. WITHIN A 24 HOUR TIME SPAN, THE NOISES WERE JUST ABOUT GONE. THERE ISN'T A DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT MY IMPLANTS REACTED TO THE INTENSE COLD AND THE ELEVATION OF THE AREA I VISITED. I CANNOT RETURN TO (B)(6) IN FEAR THIS WILL HAPPEN AGAIN.

2163607|2106125|D|1||"I'M WRITING MY STORY TO THE FDA. THIS IS ABOUT MY BREAST SILICONE IMPLANTS THAT HAVE BEEN BLEEDING OUT FOR 7 OR MORE YEARS. I STARTED TO CONTINUALLY TO BE SICK WITH SYMPTOMS LIKE: LOW GRADE FEVERS 99.6 TO 100.8 (ALL THE TIME), FATIGUE, SWOLLEN LYMPH NODES, FLU-LIKE SYMPTOMS, NIGHT SWEATS, INSOMNIA, BACKACHES, WEIGHT LOSS, WEIGHT GAIN, BONES HURTING, CANKER SORES IN MY MOUTH FOR 4 MONTHS AND ON AND OFF FOR 2 YEARS, LARGE SUB LINGUAL TONSILS, COUGHING, WEAKNESS, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, CHEST PAINS, PAIN DEEP IN THE BONES, MEMORY LOSS. UNTIL (B)(6) 2007, WHEN MY BLOOD PRESSURE WENT UP AND I STARTED GETTING CHEST PAINS, THEN I SAW MY CARDIOLOGIST. HE RAN ALL THE TESTS, ECHO, THALLIUM TREADMILL AND BP MONITOR WITH BLOOD TESTS. ALL THE TESTS CAME BACK NEGATIVE EXCEPT FOR MY CRP, IT WAS 20.6. THIS HAD MY CARDIOLOGIST CONCERNED. HE ASKED THAT I RETURNED IN 2 MONTHS FOR A REPEAT TEST TO SEE IF IT WAS STILL HIGH 20.1. IN (B)(6), THE TEST WAS REPEATED WITH THE SAME RESULT 20.1. SENT ME FOR A CHEST CT SCAN. CAME BACK ABNORMAL AGAIN. MY CT SHOWED MANY SPOTS WITH INFILTRATES IN BOTH LUNGS AND PATCHY SPOTS WITH ABNORMAL LYMPH NODES. HE REFERRED ME TO A PULMONOLOGIST; SHE SAID I NEED A LYMPH NODE BIOPSY IN MY AXILLARY'S NODES, WANTED TO R/O LYMPHOMA. SHE HAD MORE BLOOD TEST DONE AND MY CPR WAS UP TO 43 AND SED RATE WAS UP, WBC WAS UP, BLOOD WORK IS STARTING TO COME BACK ABNORMAL. SHE REFERRED ME TO A GENERAL SURGEON TO PERFORM THE BIOPSY AND THE BIOPSY CAME BACK SHOWING SILICONE IN THE LYMPH NODES AND ALSO IN MY MEDIA-STERNUM FROM THE LAST BIOPSY. THE DOCTORS ARE NOW SAYING THIS HAS BEEN LEAKING INTO SYSTEM SLOWLY SINCE BEFORE 2004 AND MY AUTOIMMUNE SYSTEM HAS BEEN FIGHTING, WHICH IS WHY I HAVE BEEN SO SICK. WELL, THE 1ST SURGERY WAS ON (B)(6) 2007. THE INCISIONS ARE ABOUT 3IN ON BOTH SIDE OF MY PELVIC AREA. THIS SURGERY WILL BE DIVIDING THE INFERIOR EPIGASTRIC BLOOD VESSELS, TRAINING THE TRAM TISSUES TO RELY ON THE SUPERIOR EPIGASTRIC SYSTEM. THIS STEP IS NOT REQUIRED FOR SUCCESSFUL PEDICLE TRAM RECONSTRUCTION BUT CAN IMPROVE BLOOD SUPPLY TO THE FLAP. SO-CALLED DELAY PROCEDURES MAY EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY OF PERFORMING MICROSURGERY (""SUPERCHARGING"") IF THE PEDICLE FLAP HAS ANY ARTERIAL OR VENOUS INSUFFICIENCY PROBLEMS, SINCE THE VESSELS DIVIDED IN THE ""DELAY"" CANNOT BE USED. IT IS INFECTING MY LUNGS AND IMMUNE SYSTEM AND OTHER MAJOR ORGANS. IN ALL I HAD A MINIMUM OF 13 MAJOR SURGERIES WHICH INCLUDE MORE RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY AND WOUND CARE, DEVELOP NECROSIS FROM THE SURGERY, ALL THE SILICONE COULD NOT BE REMOVED. I HAD DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH AND THERE IS VERY LITTLE ABOUT MY CONDITION AND SILICONE ILLNESS. BOTH THE SURGEON AND PLASTIC SURGEON HAVE SAID THIS IS A VERY RARE CONDITION. ON (B)(6) 2007, BILATERAL PEDICLES TRAM FLAP WITH THE REMOVAL OF SILICONE IMPLANTS. BOTH IMPLANTS WERE RUPTURED AND BLEEDING OUT, MORE ON THE LEFT THEN ON THE RIGHT SIDE. BUT THE PLASTIC SURGEON -PS- SAID THESE HAVE BEEN LEAKING FOR A LONG TIME. THE PS CLEANED ALL THE AREA WHILE NOT TO DISTURB THE BLOOD VESSEL FOR THE TRAM FLAPS. THE PS USED THE SKIN OF THE BREASTS FROM WHERE HE REMOVED THE IMPLANTS AND TRANSPLANTED THE FLAPS BILATERALLY TO KEEP ME THE SAME SIZE AND SYMMETRICALLY. THE ABDOMEN REPAIR ""TUMMY TUCK"". THERE HAS BEEN SOME BRUISING AROUND THE ""NEW PLACEMENT"" OF THE BELLY BUTTON AND ABDOMEN AROUND THERE. THE PS USED MESH FOR MY ABDOMEN INSTEAD OF ALLODERM, BECAUSE THE MESH WAS STRONGER. I CAN FEEL THAT MESH WHEN I WALK. I WAS IN SURGERY FOR 8 1/2 HOURS AND SUFFERED RESPIRATORY FAILURE WITH PULMONARY EDEMA WITHIN THE FIRST 24 HOURS. I WAS MOVED TO THE FLOOR AND DEVELOPED PNEUMONIA IN THE RIGHT LOWER LOBE. I SWEAR, I WAS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT BASED ON BREATHING. ANTIBIOTICS PUSH AND LASIX PUSH AND PLENTY OF RESPIRATORY THERAPY, WHEN I GOT HOME I HAD EXTRA EQUIPMENT OXYGEN, WALKER, AND HOSPITAL BED. I WAS ON A LOT OF ANTIBIOTICS AND PAIN PILLS. I WENT TO THE DOCTOR AND IT LOOKS LIKE I'M GOING TO BE ADMITTED BACK INTO THE HOSPITAL ON (B)(6) 2008 FOR MORE SURGERY FOR A WOUND THAT DEVELOPED IN THE ABDOMEN. THE SURGERY IS FOR DEBRIDEMENT OF THE WOUND THAT IS NOT HEALING AND PLACING A WOUND VAC ON IT. THE DOCTOR WILL HAVE TO REDO 8 INCHES OF THE INCISION. I WILL BE IN THE HOSPITAL FOR 2-3 DAYS; I WILL HAVE TO PRAY MORE. THE SURGERY IS SUPPOSED TO TAKE 1 TO 1 1/2 HOUR; WITH THE COMPLICATIONS OF MY LUNGS THAT TIME SHOULDN'T BE TOO BAD. I WAS AFRAID OF DEVELOPING INFECTION, (B)(6). THEN 6 WEEKS OF THE WOUND VAC ON MY ABDOMEN. I DID DEVELOP (B)(6) AND WAS HOSPITALIZE FOR 4 MONTHS IN 2008. I HAVE STARTED TO SEE THE TRANSPLANTATION TEAM TO HAVE A POSSIBLE LUNG REMOVED BEFORE I RUN OUT OF TIME. BOTH LUNGS ARE FILLED WITH SILICONE, AS WELL AS MY KIDNEYS, AND MY GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT. MY PULMONARY DOCTOR I HAVE HAS BEEN WITH ME FOR 4 YEARS, AND SHE HAS SEEN ME GET WORSE THROUGH ON-GOING TESTS AND YEARS. WITH THE LUNG BIOPSIES (B)(6) 2011, SHOWING SILICONE THROUGHOUT MY LUNGS, SHE THEN SAW MY LAST PFTS AND IT WAS WORSE BY 80% SINCE (B)(6) 2011, AND MY O2 LEVEL IS AT 7 LITERS NOW. IT HAS GONE UP BY 3 LITERS SINCE (B)(6) 2010. SO CURRENTLY, I AM GOING THROUGH THE PRE-TESTING FOR LUNG TRANSPLANTS TO SEE IF I QUALIFY FOR THE TRANSPLANTS. SO I HAVE TO GO THROUGH A LOT OF TESTING TO SEE IF MY BODY CAN HANDLE THE TRANSPLANTS. ONLY MY DOCTOR UNDERSTANDS EVERYTHING ABOUT WHAT IMPLANTS CAN DO TO YOU. SHE HAS SEEN ME GO THROUGH IT A LOT. WHEN MY IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED IN 2007, THE DOCTOR HAD TO LEAVE THE OUTER PART IN BECAUSE MY TISSUE WAS ALREADY TAKEN OVER. MY IMPLANTS HAD BEEN LEAKING UP TO 7 YEARS PER THE TIMELINE OF ALL THE ISSUE WITH MY HEALTH PER MY DOCTORS. I HOPE THE LUNG TRANSPLANTS WILL BE APPROVE TO PLACE ME ON THE ORGAN TRANSPLANT LIST. SILICONE IMPLANTS SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL MORE AND NEW UPDATED RESEARCH IS DONE.

SURGERY WAS UNEVENTFUL, I HAD HUGE SWELLING UPPER LEFT BREAST AREA POST SURGERY. I WAS DISCHARGED THE NEXT DAY WITH 2 BREAST DRAINS AND INSTRUCTED TO FOLLOW-UP WITH SURGEON. I FOLLOWED UP WITH MY PLASTIC SURGEON AT LEAST TWICE A WEEK. BREAST SURGERY WAS VERY PAINFUL. ON THIRD WEEK POST-SURGERY, I HAD SEVERAL MEDICAL COMPLAINTS: HEADACHE, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, NUMBNESS OF FACE, AND EVENTUALLY MOTTLING, REDNESS AND SWELLING OF LEFT BREAST, SWELLING ON PORT BELOW INTRA-MAMMARY FOLD. I HAD SEVERAL VISITS TO URGENT CARE, EMERGENCY HOSPITAL, AND DOCTORS' OFFICES. I DEVELOPED FEVER AND CELLULITIS ON BREAST; WHICH FELT LIKE A BALLOON. I WENT TO URGENT CARE ON (B)(6) 2012; WAS GIVEN VANCOMYCIN IV. THE NEXT DAY, I FELT THAT THE LEFT BREAST DEFLATED AND AREA AROUND PORT (INTRA-MAMMARY FOLD) FILLED WITH MORE FLUID. I SAW MY SURGEON WHO ORDERED ADMISSION TO HOSPITAL FOR SURGICAL EXPLANTATION, IRRIGATION, AND DEBRIDEMENT. SURGERY WAS PERFORMED ON THE NEXT DAY, (B)(6) 2012. CLOUDY SEROMA AND GRANULATION TISSUE WAS EVACUATED AND SALINE BREAST EXPANDER AND PORT WAS REMOVED. SAMPLES OF FLUID AND TISSUE WERE SUBMITTED FOR CULTURE AND SENSITIVITY TESTING, BUT NO HISTOPATHOLOGICAL SAMPLES WERE TAKEN. SHE SAID THAT THE IMPLANT WILL BE SUBMITTED FOR EXAMINATION AND THEN RETURNED TO MFR. I WAS GIVEN CONTINUOUS VANCOMYCIN TREATMENT FOR 2 DAYS AND WAS PRESCRIBED CIPRO AND ORAL PAIN MEDS. I HAD FOLLOW-UP VISITS AT HER OFFICE AND 2 DRAIN TUBES WERE REMOVED AFTER SEVERAL DAYS. THE INITIAL CULTURE TEST RESULTS AT (B)(6) CAME OUT AS ACID-FAST BACILLI, A FAST GROWER. I SAW AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR FOR EMPIRICAL TREATMENT WHILE WAITING FOR SENSITIVITY TESTING RESULTS. I STARTED WITH A COMBINATION TREATMENT OF CLARITHROMYCIN AND DOXYCYCLINE. THE TREATMENT WAS CONCURRED BY MY CURRENT INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR AT (B)(6) HOSPITAL. THE SAMPLE WAS SENT TO (B)(6) FOR FURTHER IDENTIFICATION AND SENSITIVITY TESTING. RESULTS OF THE TEST IDENTIFIED AS M. FORTUITUM, SENSITIVE TO CLARITHROMYCIN, BUT RESISTANT TO DOXYCYCLINE. MY INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR, REPLACED THE DOXYCYCLINE TO CIPRO IN COMBINATION WITH CLARITHROMYCIN. I FINALLY CONSULTED WITH (B)(6); WELL KNOWN EXPERTS IN DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF MYCOBACTERIAL INFECTIONS. I WANTED TO GET A ""DEFINITE REGARDING CAUSE"" OF PERSISTENT FIBRINOUS NODULAR TISSUE ON MY LEFT BREAST AND AXILLA. I FINALLY SAW AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR, WHO THEN PRESENTED MY CASE FOR REVIEW AT THEIR DEPARTMENT STAFF MEETING. ASSESSMENT WAS POSSIBLE MYCOBACTERIUM FORTUITUM IATROGENIC HEALTH CARE ASSOCIATED INFECTION OF THE LEFT BREAST IMPLANT. BECAUSE OF ABSENCE OF PERI-OPERATIVE PATHOLOGY TO LOOK FOR GRANULOMAS, NOR ABILITY TO RE-CULTURE THE SITE, PLAN WAS TO GET MRI OF RESIDUAL BREAST TISSUE AND CONSULT WITH SURGEON WHO SPECIALIZED IN MYCOBACTERIAL INFECTIONS. MRI RESULTS: SOME ABNORMAL FINDINGS, BUT COULD NOT RULE OUT IF THIS IS DUE TO INFECTIOUS DISEASE OR POST-SURGICAL CHANGES. I SAW A SURGEON AT (B)(6). SHE CONCURRED WITH (B)(6) TREATMENT OF 6 MONTHS ANTIBIOTICS AND RETURN APPOINTMENT FOR REASSESSMENT IN 3 MONTHS. ANTIBIOTIC COMBINATION WERE PRESCRIBED, CHANGED FROM TIME TO TIME TO PREVENT BACTERIAL RESISTANCE AND SIDE EFFECTS. ON THE LAST FEW WEEKS OF TREATMENT, I WAS SWITCHED TO TAKING SULFISOXAZOLE/TRIMETHOPRIM ALONE BECAUSE I WAS NOT ABLE TO TOLERATE THE SIDE EFFECTS FROM AVELOX, CIPRO, ETC. ON (B)(6) 2012, I HAD A RETURN DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT AND MRI AND BLOOD TEST AT (B)(6). SURGEON'S ASSESSMENT WAS THAT I HAVE NO APPARENT LESION OF MYCOBACTERIAL DISEASE. MY INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR WITHDREW ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT ON (B)(6). I STARTED HAVING STOMACH PAINS RIGHT AFTER I WITHDREW MY ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT. THE PAIN CONTINUED AND SPREAD ON THE ABDOMEN SPECIALLY ON THE LEFT LOWER QUADRANT. MY OBGYN DOCTOR PERFORMED ENDOMETRIAL BIOPSY WHICH RESULT WAS NEGATIVE. MY GASTROENTEROLOGIST ALSO PERFORMED COLONOSCOPY LAST WEEK AND AWAITING FOR RESULTS OF THE BIOPSY. HE SUGGESTED BREATH TEST TO RULE OUT SIBO. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF I GET AN IMPROVEMENT FROM THE COLON CLEANSING BEFORE I SCHEDULE TESTING.

BY (B)(6), I WAS STRUGGLING WITH PAINFUL AND TENDER BREASTS, INCREASING AND ULTIMATELY DEBILITATING FATIGUE, MUSCULAR WEAKNESS, SEVERE HEADACHES, AND A VERY WEAK IMMUNE SYSTEM, JUST TO NAME A FEW. I RETURNED TO THE PLASTIC SURGEON WHO HAD DONE THE SURGERY. HE TESTED ME FOR SILICONE SENSITIVITY (WHICH WAS AFFIRMATIVE), ASKED ME TO MONITOR THE SITUATION AND RETURN TO SEE HIM IF THE SITUATION CONTINUED TO DETERIORATE. AS MY CONDITION WORSENED, I TOOK LEAVE FROM MY JOB AND BECAME BED-BOUND; OFTEN BED-BOUND. IN ORDER TO RULE OUT ANY OTHER CAUSAL FACTORS, I WENT TO SEE MY FAMILY DOCTOR FOR EXAMINATION AND A THOROUGH BLOOD WORKUP. THERE WERE NO CONCLUSIVE FINDINGS SO I RETURNED TO MY SURGEON ON (B)(6). I DESCRIBED MY SYMPTOMS AND PROGRESSIVE DECLINE AND SET FORTH MY RATHER EXTENSIVE AUTO-IMMUNE HISTORY. (WHICH I NOW UNDERSTAND MADE ME A VERY POOR CANDIDATE FOR SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS.) AFTER EXAMINING MY BREASTS, THE SURGEON STATED THAT THE IMPLANTS HAD BECOME A ""SIGNIFICANT HEALTH ISSUE"" AND HAD TO COME OUT. HE OFFERED HIS NEXT SURGICAL OPENING. BY THE WAY, DR. (B)(6) IS AN AWESOME AND JUST MAN, EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT HE DID NOT EVEN CHARGE ME FOR THE EXPLANT SURGERY OF (B)(6). I AM ELATED THAT I AM ALREADY EXPERIENCING IMPROVEMENT - JUST A DAY LATER. MY PRIMARY CONCERNS WITH THE SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS ARE: THE INITIAL PAPERWORK SHOULD AFFIRM THAT THE IMPLANTS ARE NOT RECOMMENDED FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH AUTO-IMMUNE DISORDERS. MENTOR HAS POSTED THIS WARNING IN THE EXHAUSTIVE DOCUMENT THEY OFFER ON-LINE, BUT YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE LOOKING FOR IT. EVERY PROSPECTIVE CANDIDATE FOR IMPLANTS SHOULD BE TESTED FOR SILICONE SENSITIVITY BEFORE THE SURGERY. SURGEONS MUST BE ADVISED - THAT IN INDIVIDUALS WHOSE BODIES CANNOT TOLERATE THE SILICONE - THERE IS VITAL NEED TO PERFORM THE ""EN BLOC"" SURGICAL PROCEDURE WITH A CAPSULECTOMY. THE IMPLANTS MADE ME VERY ILL, BUT I AM GREATLY BLESSED WITH A WONDERFUL DOCTOR, SO THAT I WAS SPARED GOING FROM DOCTOR TO DOCTOR."|MENTOR MEMORYGEL SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS|350-2254BC|04/05/2012||||N|||0|FTR|1.0||SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT||5867688|201 MENTOR DR||SANTA BARBARA|US|MENTOR|93111|CA|93111||RF - 350-2254BC||True

BECAUSE THE LEFT PROSTHESIS INVOLVED IN THIS COMPLAINT WILL NOT BE RETURNED TO MENTOR, PE WAS PRECLUDED FROM EVALUATING THE DEVICE.

A MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION OF THE EDGES OF THE RENT REVEALED A TAPERED WEAR PATTERN. TAPER WEAR IS CHARACTERISTIC OF A CREASE/FOLD FAILURE.

3161630|3489191|D|1||I HAD SILICONE IMPLANTS PLACED UNDER MY BREAST MUSCLE IN (B)(6) 2004. I HAD BREAST FED BOTH OF MY CHILDREN AND WANTED TO REPLACE THE VOLUME LOST AFTERWARDS. I MET WITH A PLASTIC SURGEON ABOUT MY OPTIONS AND HE SUGGESTED SILICONE IMPLANTS DUE TO THEIR SOFTNESS AND ABILITY TO FEEL MORE NATURAL THAN A SALINE IMPLANT. IN (B)(6) 2012 I BEGAN TO HAVE MEDICAL PROBLEMS. IT STARTED WITH THORACIC BACK PAIN THAT WAS INTENSE AND SEVERE. IT THEN RADIATED TO MY NECK, SHOULDERS AND CHEST AREA. I HAD NUMEROUS TESTS RUN ON ME AND NOTHING PROVED TO BE THE CAUSE FOR THE PAIN I WAS FEELING. I HAD MRIS, X-RAYS, BLOOD WORK, HAD EXTENSIVE PHYSICAL THERAPY, DEEP TISSUE MASSAGE AND ACUPRESSURE FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS. I HAD INJECTIONS AND VARIOUS MEDICATIONS GIVEN TO ME TO TRY AND HELP WITH THE PAIN. IT DID NOT HELP AND I CONTINUED TO WORE. I FELT LIKE SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH MY IMPLANTS AND PERHAPS THIS WAS THE CAUSE SINCE THIS CAME ON FROM NOWHERE AND HAD ALWAYS BEEN HEALTHY AND QUITE ACTIVE. THE SURGEON WHO PLACED THEM INSIDE ME BARELY EXAMINED ME AND TOLD ME IN (B)(6) 2012 THAT IT WAS NOT FROM MY IMPLANTS AND TO SEARCH ELSEWHERE. HE DID NOT REQUEST AN MRI OF MY IMPLANTS OR ANY ADDITIONAL TESTING. AT THIS POINT I AM BECOMING MORE AND MORE FATIGUED, I AM FEELING HARDNESS IN MY LYMPH NODES IN MY BREAST AREA, AND NECK AREA. I CAN BARELY MOVE AND HAVE NO ENERGY. I AM NO MISSING A LOT OF WORK DUE TO MY SUDDEN AND PROBLEMATIC HEALTH ISSUES. I CONTINUED TO SEARCH FOR THE CAUSE. I WENT TO (B)(6) BASED ON THIS DOCTOR TELLING ME TO LOOK ELSEWHERE. AFTER A YEAR OF THIS CONTINUED PAIN AND SWELLING AND NUMEROUS DOCTOR BILLS I WENT TO ANOTHER PLASTIC SURGEON FOR HIS OPINION. HE IMMEDIATELY TOLD ME THAT MY BREASTS WERE TOO LARGE AND THAT THEY DIDN'T LOOK RIGHT. HE SAID I SHOULD HAVE THEM REMOVED TO HELP ME IMPROVE MY HEALTH. I HAD THESE IMPLANTS REMOVED ON (B)(6) 2013 AND AFTERWARDS THE SURGEON TOLD ME THAT THE IMPLANTS HAD COMPLETELY RUPTURED AND THAT THE IMPLANTS HAD LEAKED THE SILICONE EVERYWHERE. HE SAID IT WAS ONE OF THE WORSE CASES HE HAD SEEN. MY RECOVERY HAS BEEN HORRIBLE. MY LYMPH NODES ARE TOTALLY SWOLLEN AND IT IS OBVIOUS AND VERY VISIBLE. MY BACK PAIN FROM THE TRAUMA OF THE REMOVAL OF THE LEAKED SILICONE HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE. I HAVE HAD A MAJOR WEIGHT GAIN WHICH APPEARS TO BE FROM FLUID RETENTION AND MY LYMPHATIC SYSTEM APPEARS TO NOT BE WORKING PROPERLY. I NOW HAVE TO MEET WITH AN AUTOIMMUNE SPECIALIST TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING ON SINCE NO OTHER DIAGNOSIS HAS BEEN DETERMINED. I HAVE NOW LOST MY JOB DUE TO MY FAILING HEALTH AND TRULY FEEL IT IS BECAUSE OF THE RUPTURED SILICONE THAT HAD BEEN LEAKED INTO MY BODY EVERYWHERE. I HAD BEEN DISMISSED BY THE ORIGINAL SURGEON WHEN CLEARLY HE SHOULD HAVE REQUESTED AN MRI WHICH WOULD HAVE SHOWN THE RUPTURED IMPLANTS. INSTEAD I WENT ANOTHER YEAR IN MAJOR PAIN WHEN MY IMPLANTS HAD LEAKED. MY NORMAL PHYSICIAN ALSO BELIEVES THERE IS AN AUTOIMMUNE ISSUE GOING ON WITH ME DUE TO THE IMPLANTS. MY LIFE HAS BEEN DRASTICALLY AFFECTED IN MANY WAYS. IT HAS DESTROYED MY HEALTH, CAREER, PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS AND HAS FINANCIALLY DEVASTATED ME.

CONCERN OVER THE ASSOCIATION OF BREAST IMPLANTS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AUTOIMMUNE OR CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASES, SUCH AS LUPUS, SCLERODERMA, OR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, WAS RAISED BECAUSE OF CASES REPORTED IN LITERATURE WITH SMALL NUMBERS OF WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS. SCIENTIFIC EXPERT PANELS AND LITERATURE REPORTS HAVE FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF A CONSISTENT PATTERN OF SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE DISEASES IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS. ADDITIONALLY, HAVING RHEUMATOLOGICAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN A PT HAS A CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDER OR AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE. PER THE FDA'S ""UPDATE ON THE SAFETY OF SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANTS"" PUBLISHED IN JUNE 2011, THERE IS NO APPARENT ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SILICON GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANTS AND CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE, BREAST CANCER, OR REPRODUCTIVE PROBLEMS."|SILTEX ROUND MODERATE PROFILE GEL|354-2507|07/23/2013|||DA||Y||0HP|FTR|1.0||BREAST IMPLANT||206468|||IRVING|US|MENTOR||TX|||||True

I MADE THE DECISION 9 YEARS AGO TO HAVE MY BREASTS LIFTED HERE IN (B)(6). WHEN I WENT IN FOR MY FIRST CONSULTATION, THE PLASTIC SURGEON CONVINCED ME THAT I NOT ONLY NEEDED A LIFT BUT BREAST IMPLANTS AS WELL TO HAVE A BETTER OUTCOME OF THE PROCEDURE. IT ALSO ADDED ROUGHLY (B)(6) MORE TO THE LIFT MAKING THE TOTAL (B)(6). I WAS A SMALL SAGGY C CUP BEFORE MY LIFT WITH SMOOTH SALINE IMPLANTS UNDER THE MUSCLE. WHEN I HEALED FROM SURGERY, I WAS A DD, NOT WHAT I ASKED FOR. I HAD TOLD THE PS THAT I WANTED TO BA A FULL C MAY BE A SMALL D BUT NO BIGGER AND HE AGREED, ABOUT A YEAR LATER, I STARTED NOTICING THAT I WAS FEELING MORE TIRED THAN MY NORMAL SELF AND THAT I WAS HAVING CLOUDY THINKING INSTEAD OF MY USUAL SHARP SELF. I WAS ALSO EXPERIENCING MUSCLE PAIN AND STIFFNESS IN MY NECK SHOULDERS AND UPPER BACK. THE SYMPTOMS PROGRESSED A LITTLE WORSE EACH YEAR UNTIL FINAL THIS YEAR THE BRAIN FOG AND FATIGUE WAS SO BAD THAT I COULD NO LONGER FUNCTION. I STARTED SEEING EVERY SPECIALIST I COULD THINK OF. I WENT TO MY PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR SEVERAL TIMES AND HAD HIM RUN EVERY BLOOD TEST THERE IS AND THE RESULTS WERE ALWAYS THE SAME, NORMAL.

(B)(6) 2013 I REPORTED A PROBLEM TO DOCTOR (B)(6) THE PHYSICIAN WHO PERFORMED THE SURGERY THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM. I SPENT 1.5 HOURS IN HIS OFFICE EXPLAINING SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH THE RIGHT BREAST IMPLANT, I HAD PAIN IN MY RIGHT ARMPIT, THE IMPLANT FELT LOOSE AND NOT THE SAME CONSISTENCY AS THE OTHER. (THIS IS MY THIRD SET OF IMPLANTS, IT FELT DIFFERENT). HE STATED, ""THAT THE ODDS OF IT LEAKING IS 1%, IT IS A COHESIVE GEL THAT DOES NOT LEAK. IT IS JUST NORMAL AFTER BREAST SURGERY PAIN."" I HAVE HAD SEVERAL BREAST SURGERIES, NEVER FELT THIS TYPE OF PAIN. ON (B)(6) 2013 I WENT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM BECAUSE AFTER NOT WEARING A BRA TO BED I HAD SEVERE BURNING IN MY RIGHT AREOLA/NIPPLE, ARMPIT PAIN, AND MY RIGHT ARM WAS TINGLING/NUMB/PAIN INCLUDING RING FINGER/PINKY FINGER. THEY DID AN ULTRASOUND, PHONED DR (B)(6) (WHO THEN SHOWED UP TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM). ON (B)(6) 2013 DR (B)(6) SENT ME TO A WRIST ORTHO SURGEON FOR CARPAL TUNNEL, WHICH I DID NOT UNDERSTAND BECAUSE MY RIGHT BREAST HURT, ARMPIT, THE ARM, AND MY RING AND PINKY FINGER. I REQUESTED AN MRI, PERFORMED ON (B)(6) 2013. AFTER THE MRI, I WAS ASKED TO HAVE AN ULTRASOUND. THE RADIOLOGIST WOULD ONLY SAY THAT I DID NOT HAVE BREAST CANCER, I STATED ""THAT IS NOT WHY I AM HERE, IS THE SILICONE LEAKING?"" SHE WOULD NOT SAY. I SAW DR (B)(6) A BREAST SURGEON THAT DR (B)(6) SENT ME TO, WHO SCREAMED THAT I SHOULD JUST TAKE IT OUT (I HAD A WITNESS). I WENT TO MY REGULAR OB-GYN (DR (B)(6)) AND GOT A REFERRAL FOR DR (B)(6). DR (B)(6) LIFTED THE RIGHT BREAST IMPLANT SQUEEZED (NOT VERY HARD) APPROX 2 HOURS AFTER ARRIVING HOME, ALL THE PAIN SYMPTOMS STARTED IN SUCCESSION (AS BEFORE) ...BREAST, ARMPIT, NECK, BACK, THEN DOWN THE ARM AND HAND/FINGERS. THEN BOTH MY LEGS WERE HAVING SOME TYPE OF NERVE SPASMS FOR APPROX AN HOUR (THAT WAS ON A FRIDAY). SUNDAY MORNING I AWOKE TO VERY, VERY SWOLLEN LYMPH NODES IN MY NECK/THROAT. I DEBATED ON GOING TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM BECAUSE I THOUGHT MY THROAT WAS CLOSING... FAST FORWARD 6 MONTHS LATER, I HAVE SEEN AN ORTHO SURGEON, MY OB, A NEUROLOGIST, SEVERAL APPOINTMENTS WITH DOCTOR (B)(6), I HAVE BEEN TIRED, LYMPH NODES IN FRONT OF NECK SWELL, BACK OF NECK FEEL LIKE ROCKS, MY RIGHT BREAST BURNS CONSISTENTLY, ARMPIT HURTS CONSISTENTLY. I HAVE LITTLE RED BUMPS ALL OVER MY BODY (ALMOST LIKE MOLES) THEY WERE PROGRESSING AROUND MY BODY, AS WITH THE NUMBNESS/TINGLING. THE RIGHT BREAST IS SMALLER, NIPPLE LOWER, IT DOES NOT FEEL LIKE IT HAS A DENSE CONSISTENCY. THE RADIOLOGIST REPORT WAS WRITTEN INCORRECTLY, IT STATES... ""A PREPECTORAL SILICONE IMPLANT IS NOTED IN PLACE WITH INTACT SALINE ENVELOPE."" THIS HAS BEEN AN ISSUE BECAUSE UPON GETTING A SECOND AND THIRD OPINION, BECAUSE THERE IS NO SALINE. THIS INDICATES AN IMPLANT THAT IS NO LONGER MADE. I HAVE ASKED FOR THE REPORT TO BE AMENDED, AND THE DOCTOR (RADIOLOGIST DECLINED). DR (B)(6) SAID I SHOULD REPLACE IT, HE WOULD NOT SAY IT WAS LEAKING. DR (B)(6) SAID I SHOULD REPLACE IT, SHE WOULD NOT SAY IT WAS LEAKING.

5004369|23148611|D|1||I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY CORRESPONDENCE FROM MENTOR ABOUT PROBLEMS OR FAULTY IMPLANTS OR ANY IMPLANT STUDY; NEITHER HAVE ANY OF MY FRIENDS WHO HAD IMPLANTS DUE TO CANCER. IN 1990 I HAD A LEFT BREAST RECONSTRUCTED AFTER A MASTECTOMY IN 1989. I HAD ONLY ONE TROUBLE-FREE YEAR WITH THE MENTOR BECKER PROSTHESIS. I COMPLAINED OFTEN TO MY PS DOCTOR THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS CAUSING SEVERE ITCHING, CHANGING SHAPE AND MAKING LUMPY SPOTS ON MY TORSO. IN 2002, I HAD XRAYS SHOWING ALL THE SALINE HAD LEAKED OUT AND THE SILICONE WAS LEAKING INTO THE BROKEN SALINE BAG. THE PS AGREED TO TAKE IT OUT, BUT WANTED TO REPLACE IT WITH A DIFFERENT KIND, A MENTOR SALINE PRODUCT. I WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A QUICK SURGERY AND GO HOME THAT DAY; INSTEAD, THE SURGERY TOOK FOUR HOURS, I SPENT SEVERAL PAINFUL DAYS IN THE HOSPITAL AND A WEEK AT HOME OFF WORK. I WAS TOLD THAT THE SILICONE IMPLANT HAD BROKEN IN MY CHEST WALL AND IT HAD TO BE CLEANED AND WASHED OUT. IN 2008, MY HEALTH STARTED A FAST DETERIORATION. DURING THE NEXT FEW YEARS MY GP DOCTOR BEGAN TO RUN VARIOUS TESTS ON ME AND SAW A PATTERN. I WAS HAVING IMMUNE SYSTEM PROBLEMS, AND MANY TESTS THAT HAD BEEN OK BEGAN TO BE OFF NORMAL. HE KNEW THAT I HAD THAT NEW BREAST IMPLANT AFTER THE FIRST ONE RUPTURED. WHEN THE ANA LUPUS TEST WAS POSITIVE AND SEVERAL RELATED TESTS WERE BAD, HE TOLD ME HE THOUGHT I SHOULD SEE A RHEUMATOLOGIST. BOTH DOCTORS TOLD ME TO HAVE THE IMPLANT REMOVED. I WENT TO SEE MY PLASTIC SURGEON ONLY TO FIND OUT HE WAS MOVING TO ANOTHER STATE AND SEMI-RETIRING. HE ALSO SAID AFTER MY SURGERY HE NO LONGER WORKED WITH SILICONE IMPLANTS. HE INTRODUCED ME TO A NEW PLASTIC SURGEON WHO TAUGHT AT THE MEDICAL SCHOOL. I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH HER TO SEE IF SHE WOULD REMOVE MY IMPLANT AND TOLD HER ABOUT MY MEDICAL PROBLEMS. SHE SAID THERE WAS NO HARD EVIDENCE THAT BREAST IMPLANTS CAUSED THEM AND CONVINCED ME I SHOULD THINK ABOUT HOW MY BODY WOULD LOOK WITHOUT THE IMPLANT. I WENT HOME AND TRIED TO DEAL WITH MY HEALTH PROBLEMS, AND SAW MY RHEUMATOLOGIST. MY TESTS WERE GETTING WORSE, I BARELY WALKED WITH A CANE, MY EYES AND GUMS WERE INFECTED, MY JOINTS WERE INFLAMED, MY HAIR WAS FALLING OUT AND MY SKIN WAS PUFFY. HE TOLD ME I NEEDED TO GET THE IMPLANT TAKEN OUT SOON BECAUSE EVEN A LITTLE BIT OF SILICONE LIKE THE COVER OF THE IMPLANT WOULD WORSEN THE AUTOIMMUNE RESPONSE OF MY BODY. I WENT BACK TO THE NEW PLASTIC SURGEON, BUT THIS TIME I SHOWED HER I SHOWED HER MY OFFICIAL HOSPITAL SURGERY REPORTS. AFTER SHE SAW THEM, SHE LOOKED UP SOME MORE ABOUT IT AND FOUND THAT MY FIRST IMPLANT WAS SO BADLY RUPTURED THAT THE SURGEONS COULDN'T GET ALL OF IT AND EVEN THE BACK PORTION OF THE FIRST IMPLANT WAS STILL STUCK TO MY CHEST WALL OVER MY HEART. SHE EXPLAINED HOW DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE TO GET THAT OUT, BUT SHE COMPLETELY CHANGED HER MIND ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE RUPTURE AND SILICONE ON MY HEALTH. SHE PRESCRIBED A BREAST SURGEON AND AN MRI, WHICH SHOWED SILICONE MIGRATED ALL OVER MY MID, LEFT, AND SIDE TORSO AND THE WHOLE BACK OF THE IMPLANT WAS STUCK TO MY RIBS, AND THE SALINE CAPSULE HAD RUPTURED. MY IMMUNE SYSTEM HAD BUILT A SCAR TISSUE WALL AROUND IT TRYING TO GET RID OF IT ALL. LONG STORY SHORT: I HAD A SIX HOUR SURGERY (B)(6) 2012 WITH TWO SURGEONS AND TWO RESIDENT PS'S, FOR AN EXPLANTATION AND MASTECTOMY OF MY RIGHT BREAST. THEY CLEANED OFF ALL THE SILICONE THEY COULD FIND INCLUDING THE BACK PIECE OF THE IMPLANT OVER MY HEART. MY PS WAS SMILING WHEN SHE CAME IN TO TELL ME THE GOOD NEWS. I DON'T THINK SHE WILL EVER TELL ANOTHER WOMAN THAT THERE IS NO CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SILICONE IMPLANT AND HEALTH CONCERNS. MY HEALTH STARTED IMPROVING IMMEDIATELY BUT NOT THE OSTEOPOROSIS IN MY HIPS NOR MY JOINTS. I'VE HAD BOTH HIPS REPLACED AND STILL HAD ANA POSITIVE TESTS. I'M TOLD I HAD THE SILICONE IN MY SYSTEM TOO LONG. I LOST MORE THAN TEN YEARS OF A ONCE HEALTHY LIFE TO SILICONE POISONING.

5221831|31193114|D|1||IN 2004, I RECEIVED A BREAST AUGMENTATION PROCEDURE. THE IMPLANTS I HAD PUT IN WERE FILLED WITH SALINE. A FEW YEARS WENT BY WITH NO INCIDENT OR ISSUE, HOWEVER THIS WAS A SHORT LIVED BLISS. AFTER ABOUT THE FIFTH YEAR OF HAVING THE IMPLANTS, I BEGAN HAVING SYMPTOMS OF BACK PAIN, FATIGUE, AND A BURNING SENSATION IN MY CHEST WALL. NOT LONG AFTER THESE SYMPTOMS STARTED, SOON MORE SYMPTOMS BEGAN TO DEVELOP SUCH AS: LOW GRADE FEVERS THAT WERE ACCOMPANIED BY SHOOTING/BURNING PAINS THAT CONSUMED MY ENTIRE BODY. AFTER SEEING MY GENERAL PHYSICIAN FOR THESE ISSUES, HE DIAGNOSED WITH FIBROMYALGIA AFTER MANY EVALUATIONS FOLLOWING. THIS CAME AS A SHOCK TO ME AND ALL OF MY FAMILY. THE MEDICINES USED TO TREAT AND ALLEVIATE FIBROMYALGIA SYMPTOMS BROUGHT ABOUT SIDE EFFECTS THAT WERE LESS THAN DESIRABLE MEDICINES AS THEY DID NOT HELP ME WHATSOEVER AND ONLY WORSENED MY WELL BEING. THE THREE OR SO YEARS THAT FOLLOWED AFTER THE FIBROMYALGIA DIAGNOSIS WERE A CONSTANT BATTLE OF CHRONIC FATIGUE, LOW GRADE FEVERS, BURNING/SHOOTING PAINS, MILD DEPRESSION, AND FLU LIKE SYMPTOMS. IN THE PAST YEAR, I HAVE BEEN MOSTLY BED RIDDEN AND CHRONICALLY ILL, NOT ABLE TO HAVE A NORMAL FUNCTIONING LIFE, AND DEALING WITH THE ABOVE STATED SYMPTOMS THAT HAVE WORSENED. ALL ALONG THESE MANY YEARS OF DEALING WITH SYMPTOMS UNK AS TO WHY THEY WERE OCCURRING, THEN BEING THOUGHT TO HAVE FIBROMYALGIA, DIVINE INTERVENTION LED ME TO DIG DEEPER INTO MY EXISTING CONDITION, AS I COULD NOT AND WOULD NOT ACCEPT THIS HEALTH DETERIORATION AS WHAT I WILL FACE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

HERE AND THERE THROUGHOUT THESE MANY YEARS, I SPECULATED THAT THE CULPRIT BEHIND MY HEALTH PROBLEMS COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN STEMMING FROM MY BREAST IMPLANTS, BUT AFTER CONSULTING THE COSMETIC SURGEON WHO PERFORMED BY BREAST AUGMENTATION, AND OTHER VARIOUS PHYSICIANS, I WAS CONVINCED BY THESE PRACTITIONERS THAT MY BREAST IMPLANTS WERE MOST DEFINITELY NOT THE CAUSE OF MY HEALTH ISSUES. NATURALLY, IT IS ANYONE'S INCLINATION TO TRUST WHAT DOCTORS TELL US, AND THEREFORE I DID JUST THAT. NOT BEING ABLE TO LET GO OF THE PRESSING THOUGHT THAT MY BREAST IMPLANTS JUST MIGHT BE THE ROOT TO ALL OF MY SUFFERING, I BEGAN PUTTING ALL OF MY EXPENDABLE ENERGY INTO RIGOROUS RESEARCH REGARDING BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESSES. IT DID NOT TAKE ME VERY LONG TO CONCLUDE THAT MY SUSPICIONS OF MY BREAST IMPLANTS WERE INDEED THE ROOT CAUSE OF ALL OF MY MANY YEARS OF PAIN AND SUFFERING. I QUICKLY LEARNED ABOUT A DOCTOR OUT OF (B)(6) WHO SPECIALIZES AND ADVOCATES IN BREAST IMPLANT DISEASES AND BREAST IMPLANT REMOVALS. I THEN STARTED A REGULAR CORRESPONDENCE WITH THIS DOCTOR AND SET AN APPOINTMENT TO HAVE MY IMPLANTS REMOVED. PRIOR TO MY REMOVAL SURGERY, MY BLOOD LABORATORY RESULTS SHOWED THE PRESENCE OF MYCOPLASMA PNEUMONIA. THIS ALARMED ME AS I LEARNED THE NATURE OF THIS HARMFUL MICROORGANISM THAT INVADED BY BODY AS A RESULT OF TAINTED IMPLANTS AND A SUPPRESSED IMMUNITY. IT TURNS OUT THAT FOR YEARS, MY BODY WAS FIGHTING A SILENT BATTLE THAT EVENTUALLY BEGAN SHOWING ITS FACE WITH THE ONSET OF MY INITIAL SYMPTOMS YEARS EARLIER. ALL OF THE YEARS THAT WENT BY WITH LITTLE TO NO ANSWERS OR REPUTABLE TREATMENTS, THE MYCOPLASMA WAS WREAKING HAVOC WITHIN MY BODY AND TERRIBLY STRESSING MY IMMUNE SYSTEM. WHEN MY BREAST IMPLANT REMOVAL SURGERY DAY CAME ABOUT, MY SURGEON WAS NOT SURPRISED TO SEE THAT MY BREAST TISSUES SURROUNDING THE IMPLANTS WERE BADLY INFECTED AND GROWING MOLD AND FUNGUS. FIVE INFECTED LYMPH NODES WERE REMOVED THAT WERE LOCATED NEAR THE BREAST, ALONG WITH THE INFECTED TISSUES, AND OF COURSE THE IMPLANTS THEMSELVES. MY SURGEON WHO PERFORMED THE REMOVAL, ALSO EXPLAINED THAT THE MYCOPLASMA PNEUMONIA WAS RESIDING WITHIN ANY AND ALL REGIONS OF BY BODY INCLUDING MAJOR INTERNAL ORGANS.|SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS||11/09/2015||||*|*||0LP|FWM|1.0||SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS||475 CC|||||MENTOR|||||5530938||True

EACH YEAR SINCE, I HAVE HAD AN INCREASING AMOUNT OF SYMPTOMS BEGIN AND BASICALLY EACH ORGAN WITHIN MY BODY FELT AS THOUGH IT WAS FAILING AS MY SYMPTOMS WORSENED. I HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO SPECIALISTS IN VARIOUS DIFFERENT SPECIALITIES AS WELL AS HOLISTIC HEALERS AND NATUROPATHS TRYING TO FIND THE SOURCE OF MY SUDDEN ONSET OF ILLNESSES. PRIOR TO HAVING THE BREAST IMPLANTS, I WAS A HEALTHY MOTHER OF TWO AND HARDLY EVER MISSED WORK FOR ANYTHING BEYOND THE COMMON COLD. WITH ALL OF THE MEDICAL PROBLEMS, I WAS REQUIRED TO FILE (B)(6) WITH MY EMPLOYER OF SIX YEARS DUE TO THE NATURE OF MY SYMPTOMS AND THE AMOUNT OF WORK I MISSED FOR TREATMENTS AND NEW CONSULTATIONS WITH DOCTORS ON A CONSISTENT BASIS. I WAS FINALLY DIAGNOSED WITH COMMON VARIABLE IMMUNE DEFICIENCY AND BEGAN IVIG TREATMENTS EVERY OTHER WEEK TRYING TO PREVENT THE CONSTANT INFECTIONS I WAS GETTING REGULARLY AND I HOPED WAS THE SOURCE OF MY PROBLEMS. AFTER A YEAR OF THOSE TREATMENTS AND MORE REFERRALS TO DIFFERENT SPECIALISTS, I FOUND A GROUP OF WOMEN WHO ALL HAVE EVERY SYMPTOM THAT I HAD AND SOME EVEN MORE AND THEY HAVE BEEN LINKED TO THEIR BREAST IMPLANTS AND HAVE CALLED THE ILLNESS BII OR BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESS. AFTER HEARING THAT WOMEN WERE GETTING BETTER AFTER HAVING THEM REMOVED, I DECIDED TO EXPLANT ON (B)(6) 2016. SINCE THAT TIME, OVER HALF OF MY SYMPTOMS HAVE DISAPPEARED AND OTHERS ARE GOING AWAY EACH DAY. I AM ON LESS THAN OF HALF OF THE MEDICATIONS I HAD BEE TAKING SINCE IMPLANTING IN 2012 AND I FEEL OVER 50% BETTER THAN I DID WHILE THE IMPLANTS WERE IN MY BODY. I DO NOT KNOW FOR SURE IF THERE WAS MOLD OR FUNGUS PRESENT AS MOST COSMETIC SURGEONS WIL NOT TEST THEM AFTER TAKING THEM OUT AND DO NOT BELIEVE THAT BREAST IMPLANTS (ESPECIALLY SALINE) CAN MAKE WOMEN ILL. I HAVE RECENTLY FOUND OUT THE COMBINATION OF TOXIC MATERIALS USED TO MAKE THE SHELL OF SALINE IMPLANTS AND WAS NEVER GIVEN THAT LIST OF INGREDIENTS PRIOR TO IMPLANTING. MOST OF MY SYMPTOMS MIMIC THAT OF AN AUTOIMMUNE ILLNESS YET I WAS GIVEN NO DIAGNOSIS DUE TO ""NORMAL"" LAB WORK. I HAVE NEVER BEEN DIAGNOSED NOR HAD THE SYMPTOMS OF AUTOIMMUNE ILLNESS PRIOR TO IMPLANTING AND BELIEVE THE SALINE IMPLANTS HAVE MADE ME ILL AND TAKEN AWAY 4 YEARS OF MY LIFE. WOMEN SHOULD BE TOLD THE INGREDIENTS AND SURGEONS SHOULD NOT TELL US THAT SALINE OR SILICONE IMPLANTS ARE SAFE AFTER THE PROBLEMS WITH EARLIER IMPLANTS. I ALSO WAS NOT TESTED OR ASKED IF I HAD AN AUTOIMMUNE ILLNESSES PRIOR TO IMPLANTING. BOTH SALINE AND SILICONE IMPLANTS ARE MAKING WOMEN SICK AND IN SOME CASES LEADING TO DEATH. THEY WOULD NOT BE ADVERTISED AS SAFE AND FURTHER TESTING NEEDS TO BE DONE TO FIND OUT WHY THOUSANDS OF WOMEN ARE BECOMING ILL WITH THE SAME SYMPTOMS. I AM PROOF THAT BII EXISTS. HERE ARE MY LIST OF SYMPTOMS PRIOR TO EXPLANTING. THERE WERE SEVERAL MORE RIGHT BEFORE MY EXPLANT SURGERY BUT COULD NOT LIST THEM AS MY ""BRAIN FOG"" AND MEMORY ISSUES BECAME DEBILITATING. CHARLEY HORSES (RLS), IRRITABILITY, FOOD SENSITIVITIES, SWOLLEN HANDS/FEET, FREQUENT URINATION, FATIGUE, BRAIN FOG, MEMORY LOSS, DIFFICULTY GETTING TO SLEEP (FEEL LIKE I DIDN'T SLEEP), HAIR LOSS, HEADACHES, MUSCLE PAIN, MUSCLE WEAKNESS, CARPAL TUNNEL, VEIN ISSUES, HOT ALL THE TIME, TENDON ISSUES, VISION PROBLEMS, EPITHELIAL IN GROWTH, PANIC ATTACKS, EAR PAIN (HAVE TUBES), SKIN ISSUES, DELAYED HEALING, SORES (FACE, CHEST, BACK), NO SEX DRIVE, CRYING, SIDE EFFECTS TO MEDICATIONS, IMMUNE DEFICIENCY, FIBROMYALGIA, WEIGHT GAIN/LOSS, HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, BRUISING, OCD MOMENTS, INFLAMMATION, CANDIDA/YEAST INFECTIONS, THYROID CHANGES, LOSS OF APPETITE, NIGHT SWEATS, CONSTIPATION, VERTIGO (DIZZY), ANXIETY, PANIC ATTACKS. THERE IS CURRENTLY NO LAB, SCANS OR ANY OTHER DIAGNOSTIC TEST THAT CAN IDENTIFY BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESS. THERE ARE ALSO NO TESTS AVAILABLE TO TEST FOR MOLD, FUNGUS, BACTERIA OR ANY OF THE OTHER TOXIC INGREDIENTS IN THE IMPLANT MATERIALS IN A HUMAN BODY. IF THERE ARE ANY, MOST PHYSICIANS ARE NOT AWARE OF THEM OR BELIEVE THEY ARE INACCURATE. IF WOMEN FIND A PROVIDER OF TESTS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT IDENTIFY ANY OF THE INGREDIENTS LISTED ABOVE, WE HAVE TO PAY HUNDREDS TO THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO OBTAIN TESTS THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY RECOGNIZED BY THE MEDICAL FIELD.

6016441|57253924|D|1||I HAD TO HAVE MY MENTOR SMOOTH ROUND MODERATE PLUS PROFILE GEL (MEMORY GEL) IMPLANTS REMOVED ON (B)(6) 2016. I RECEIVED THE IMPLANTS IN (B)(6) 2009. AFTER 4 YEARS, I NOTICED STRANGE SYMPTOMS WHICH I INITIALLY DID NOT ATTRIBUTE TO MY IMPLANTS. THESE STARTED MILDLY AND GREW INCREASINGLY WORSE OVER TIME: INSOMNIA, HEART ARRHYTHMIA, DRY EYES, DRY MOUTH, DRY HAIR, HAIR LOSS, EAR RINGING, WEIGHT GAIN, SKIN ITCHING, JOINT PAIN, BRAIN FOG, COLD HANDS/FEET, AND CHEST (RIB CAGE) PAIN. WHEN THE SYMPTOMS BEGAN, I WAS LIVING OVERSEAS AND DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO GOOD HEALTH CARE. UPON MY RETURN AND RESETTLEMENT BACK TO THE US, I BEGAN INVESTIGATING THE SYMPTOMS BY STARTING WITH MY NEPHROLOGIST ( I HAVE ONE CONGENITALLY SMALL KIDNEY) IN (B)(6) WHO RAN A PANEL OF LABS. HE ALSO REFERRED ME TO A CARDIOLOGIST. ALL OF THESE TESTS CAME BACK NEGATIVE OR NORMAL. I SAW MY PCP WHO RAN A SECOND PANEL OF LABS, ALL CAME BACK NEGATIVE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HIGH LDL CHOLESTEROL AND LOW VITAMIN D. SHE REFERRED ME TO SEE AN ENDOCRINOLOGIST AND CHANGE JOBS TO SOMETHING LESS STRESSFUL. I DID CHANGE JOBS TO SOMETHING WITH NO TRAVEL AND ALSO DID SEE AN ENDOCRINOLOGIST. MY LABS CAME BACK NORMAL EXCEPT FOR THE HIGH LDL, CHOLESTEROL FOR WHICH SHE STARTED ME ON SIMVASTATIN. SHE REFERRED ME TO A DERMATOLOGIST FOR THE HAIR DRYNESS/LOSS, WHO I DID SEE BUT RESULTS WERE INCONCLUSIVE WITHOUT A SCALP BIOPSY (WHICH I DON'T WANT). ON MY OWN, I ALSO SAW A RHEUMATOLOGIST THINKING THERE WAS SOMETHING MORE SERIOUS GOING ON. BY THIS POINT, I WAS EXHAUSTED AND THE JOINT PAIN WAS BECOMING UNBEARABLE TO THE POINT THAT I WAS CUTTING BACK ON MY HOBBIES AND OTHER ACTIVITIES. BUT THOSE RHEUMATOLOGY LABS ALSO CAME BACK INCONCLUSIVE THOUGH THE MD DID DIAGNOSE ME WITH FIBROMYALGIA BASED ON SYMPTOMOLOGY ALONE. I BEGAN RESEARCHING MY SYMPTOMS ONLINE TRYING TO MAKE ANY CONNECTIONS I COULD TO BIRTH CONTROL, HERNIA REPAIRS (ANYTHING IN MY MEDICAL HISTORY WHICH MAY HAVE CAUSED THE ISSUE). I FOUND AN ARTICLE WHICH SAID THE SILICONE IN A MIRENA IUD CAN IGNITE AN INFLAMMATORY AUTOIMMUNE RESPONSE. I DIDN'T HAVE A MIRENA IUD BUT I CONNECTED THE SILICONE NOTE TO MY IMPLANTS. I BEGAN RESEARCHING ILLNESS ASSOCIATED WITH SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. I DID FIND A FEW ARTICLES BY MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL (MOSTLY IN EUROPE) THAT INDICATED THAT THERE COULD BE A CONNECTION, BUT MOSTLY IT SEEMED THAT PHYSICIANS AND THE US MEDICAL COMMUNITY AT LARGE DEEMED THE DEVICES SAFE (THOUGH THERE WERE NO LONG-TERM STUDIES (>5 YEARS) THAT SUPPORTED THE DEVICES TO BE SAFE OVER TIME). BECAUSE I COULD FIND NO TRULY SUPPORTIVE, LONG-TERM SAFETY DATA, AND BECAUSE OF THE MASSIVE AMOUNT OF WOMEN WHO WERE REPORTING MY SAME EXACT SYMPTOMS ONLINE IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR BREAST IMPLANTS. I BECAME CERTAIN THERE WAS ALSO A CONNECTION BETWEEN MY IMPLANTS AND MY DEGRADING HEALTH.

I THEN PUT THEM AWAY AND ONLY RECENTLY PULLED THEM OUT TO SHOW MY HUSBAND. THEY ARE NOW OVERED IN A SLIMY RESIDUE WHICH WAS NOT PRESENT AT THE TIME THEY WERE PROVIDED TO ME BACK IN MAY.

I'M WRITING TO REPORT AN ADVERSE EVENT (MANY ACTUALLY) RELATED TO HAVING HAD DOW CORNING SILASTIC II BREAST IMPLANTS. I HAD THEM FOR 22 YEARS. I HAD UNDIAGNOSED RUPTURE FOR 16 YEARS BECAUSE DOCTORS FAILED TO CONNECT MY SYMPTOMS TO MY IMPLANTS. DOCTORS THAT DON'T BELIEVE BREAST IMPLANTS MAKE WOMEN ILL IMPEDE A TIMELY DIAGNOSIS. I WAS NEVER SENT FOR THE RIGHT DIAGNOSTIC TESTS WHEN I PRESENTED WITH SYMPTOMS THAT WERE TEXTBOOK FOR RUPTURE. IT WASN'T UNTIL I CAME TO BE UNDER THE CARE OF A YOUNG RESIDENT DOCTOR WHO WAS ASSIGNED MY CASE BECAUSE ALL OF THE LOCAL DOCTORS HAD DETERMINED MY SYMPTOMS WERE PSYCHOSOMATIC. THIS RESIDENT DOCTOR LOOKED ME IN THE EYES AND ASKED IF I REALLY BELIEVED THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG. I REPLIED, YES, I KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG, BUT NOBODY WILL FIND IT BECAUSE NOBODY IS BOTHERING TO LOOK. I SHOWED HIM, USING MY HANDS, WHERE I COULD FEEL SOMETHING INSIDE ME. HE ORDERED AN ULTRASOUND WHICH DIAGNOSED RUPTURE. FROM THERE I REQUESTED AN MRI, BUT WAS DENIED BY A LOCAL SURGEON. THE ONE THAT HADN'T BOTHERED TO PROPERLY INVESTIGATE MY SYMPTOMS. I PERSISTED, AND HE FINALLY SAID HE WOULD ONLY ORDER MRI IF THE RADIOLOGIST THOUGHT IT APPROPRIATE. THE MRI PROVED TO BE AN EXACT MAP OF WHERE I'D SHOWN THE RESIDENT DOCTOR WHERE I COULD FEEL SOMETHING INSIDE MY CHEST WALL. BECAUSE OF THE LONG STANDING NATURE OF RUPTURE, SILICONE HAD MIGRATED DEEPLY INTO MY CHEST WALL. I WAS EXPLANTED (B)(6) 2013. I WAS ON DEATH'S DOORSTEP. MY EXPLANT SURGEON TOLD ME MY PROGNOSIS IS POOR. DESPITE HAVING EXPLANT SURGERY I STILL HAVE SILICONE IN ME AND IT CONTINUES TO MIGRATE. I HAVE HAD MULTIPLE ULTRASOUNDS OF MY LEFT BREAST. I HAVE SILICONE OUTSIDE OF THE AREAS OF FOCUS. I CAN FEEL IT (AS I COULD PRIOR TO EXPLANT) AND I AM NOTICING NEW LYMPH NODE INVOLVEMENT OUTSIDE OF THE REGION OF MY BREASTS. FOR ABOUT 2 YEARS POST EXPLANT I HAD IMPROVEMENT IN MANY SYMPTOMS BUT, AFTER 6 MONTHS AGO SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS STARTED TO RETURN AND COINCIDED WITH FEELING INCREASED PAIN AND LOCALIZED SYMPTOMS IN MY LEFT BREAST. YOU SHOULD BE VERY INTERESTED TO KNOW THAT THE LOCAL SURGEON THAT FAILED TO DIAGNOSE MY RUPTURE TOLD ME THAT MOVING FORWARD HE WILL NOT PROACTIVELY SEND WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS THAT ARE PRESENTING TO HIM WITH SYMPTOMS CONSISTENT WITH RUPTURE FOR AN ULTRASOUND OR MRI BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO BECOME INVOLVED. MY STORY DURING IMPLANT THE SURGEON RIPPED AN ENTIRE BUNDLE OF NERVES IN MY LEFT BREAST SO I WAS IN A LOT OF PAIN FROM THE START! THE NERVES TOOK ABOUT SIX YEARS TO HEAL AND THE PAIN FINALLY SUBSIDED, BUT THAT WAS ALSO THE TIME THAT MY IMPLANTS HAD UNKNOWINGLY RUPTURED. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING IMPLANT I ALSO NOTED THAT MY BREASTS WERE REALLY, REALLY COLD. AND, THE WORST THING, WHICH BROKE MY HEART, WAS WHEN I RETURNED HOME I REALIZED THAT FROM THAT POINT I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO FEEL MY CHILDREN AGAINST MY HEART AND THEIR EXPERIENCE OF HUGGING ME WOULD...|SILASTIC II, ROUND, LOW PROFILE SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLANT|PO14-0260|08/31/2016||||N|*||I|FTR|1.0||SILASTIC II, ROUND, LOW PROFILE SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLANT||HH119236|||||DOW CORNING WRIGHT/MENTOR|||||||True

5383915|36624391|D|1||I AM WRITING TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I HAD MENTOR BREAST IMPLANTS PUT IN BACK IN (B)(6) 2011. WITHIN 3-4 MONTHS, I STARTED GETTING ILL, PAINFUL JOINTS, ITCHY BREASTS, BRAIN FOG, AND VISION PROBLEMS. AS TIME HAS PROGRESSED, I HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH SLE LUPUS, SJOGRENS DISEASE, LUNG DISEASE, MIXED CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE, THYROID PROBLEMS, INTERSTITIAL BLADDER DISEASE, AND A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER ILLNESSES. IT WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT MY IMPLANTS COULD POSSIBLY BE CAUSING MY ILLNESSES SO WITHOUT HESITATION I HAD THE IMPLANTS REMOVED IN (B)(6) 2013. IMMEDIATELY THE ITCHING ON MY BREASTS WENT AWAY, BUT UNFORTUNATELY ALL MY OTHER SYMPTOMS REMAINED. I KNOW THERE ARE LARGE NUMBERS OF WOMEN WHO HAVE THE SAME ISSUES AFTER IMPLANTS. I FEEL VERY STRONGLY AS DO MANY WOMEN THAT IMPLANTS NEED TO BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET UNTIL THEY CAN BE FURTHER TESTED. MY HEALTH HAS DETERIORATED TO THE POINT THAT I CAN BARELY TAKE CARE OF MY (B)(6) DAUGHTER. I'M ON SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY AND MEDICARE AT THE AGE OF (B)(6). MIND YOU, I WAS PERFECTLY HEALTHY PRIOR TO IMPLANTS. OTHERWISE, I WOULDN'T HAVE GONE AHEAD WITH THE SURGERY. WOMEN LOOK TO YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT IS BEING SOLD IS SAFE FOR US AND THAT WE ARE NOT RISKING OUR LIVES IF WE CHOOSE TO GO FORWARD WITH THE SURGERY AND HAVE IMPLANTS PUT IN. CLEARLY THESE NEED TO BE TESTED FURTHER BEFORE MORE WOMEN ARE HURT AND THEIR LIVES ARE RUINED THE WAY MINE HAS AND SO MANY OTHER WOMEN.|BREAST IMPLANTS||01/17/2016||||*|*||0LP|FWM|1.0||BREAST IMPLANTS|||||||MENTOR|||||||True

WHILE MY STOMACH SYMPTOMS SUBSIDED DUE TO DIET CHANGE I CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE CHRONIC DIARRHEA AND CONSTIPATION. TEST FOR CROHN'S AND ULCERATIVE COLITIS WAS NEGATIVE. I BEGAN EXPERIENCING CHRONIC FATIGUE. IN EARLY (B)(6) OF 2015 I BECAME VERY ILL: MY SYMPTOMS WERE AS FOLLOWS; EXTREME FATIGUE, EYE PAIN, EYE BURNING, PHOTOPHOBIA, HEADACHE, BODY ACHES, BACK PAIN (UPPER AND LOWER), NECK PAIN, NAUSEA, LOSS OF APPETITE, WEIGHT GAIN THAT LASTED UNTIL (B)(6) OF 2016. IN (B)(6) I HAD AN AUTOIMMUNE PANEL. MY ELISA ANA WAS POSITIVE AND SO WAS MY ANTI-CLQ IGG. HOWEVER, SLE, RHEUMATOID FACTOR, ENA, ANTI-PHOSPHOLIPID, AND ANTI-THYROID WERE ALL NEGATIVE. IN NOVEMBER 2015 I ALSO SAW AN OPHTHALMOLOGIST WHO DID NOT SEE ANY INFLAMMATION IN THE EYE BUT DID SUGGEST SICCA. IN JANUARY, WHILE MY SYMPTOMS HAD SUBSIDED SLIGHTLY BUT NOT COMPLETELY, I SAW A NEUROLOGIST FOR HEADACHES. A MRI WAS ORDERED AND RESULTS WERE NORMAL, BUT HE SUGGESTED MY SYMPTOMS WERE RHEUMATOLOGICAL. A RHEUMATOLOGIST ORDERED A MRI AND X-RAYS OF MY UPPER AND LOWER BACK. I WAS ALSO TESTED FOR HLA-B27 WHICH CAME BACK POSITIVE. THERE WERE NO RADIOGRAPHIC CHANGES, HOWEVER, BASED ON MY CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND POSITIVE TEST FOR HLA-B27 I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS. I WAS PRESCRIBED CELECOXIB WHICH IMPROVED MY BACK PAIN BUT DID NOT IMPROVE MY OTHER SYMPTOMS. I AM CURRENTLY BEING TESTED FOR LYME DISEASE AND RECHECKING MY THYROID LEVELS. I CURRENTLY HAVE OVER 20 SYMPTOMS WHICH ARE AS FOLLOWS: DRY EYE/HAIR/SKIN, HAIR LOSS, EAR RINGING, EYE PAIN, HEADACHE, HEART PALPITATIONS, INSOMNIA, ITCHING UNDER RIGHT IMPLANT, LOWER/UPPER BACK PAIN, NECK PAIN, MOUTH SORES, MUSCLE PAIN, MUSCLE TWITCHING, CHEST PAIN, COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION, CONSTIPATION, NIGHT SWEATS, PHOTOPHOBIA, SKIN RASH (ONCE ON FOREHEAD), JOINT PAIN, EKG WAS NORMAL.

CONCERN OVER THE ASSOCIATION OF BREAST IMPLANTS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AUTOIMMUNE OR CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASES, SUCH AS LUPUS, SCLERODERMA, OR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, WAS RAISED BECAUSE OF CASES REPORTED IN LITERATURE WITH SMALL NUMBERS OF WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS. SCIENTIFIC EXPERT PANELS AND LITERATURE REPORTS HAVE FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF A CONSISTENT PATTERN OF SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE DISEASES IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS. ADDITIONALLY, HAVING RHEUMATOLOGICAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN A PATIENT HAS A CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDER OR AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE. PER THE FDA'S ""UPDATE ON THE SAFETY OF SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANTS"" PUBLISHED IN JUNE 2011, ""THERE IS NO APPARENT ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANTS AND CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE, BREAST CANCER, OR REPRODUCTIVE PROBLEMS.""

I HAD SINUS SURGERY TO TRY TO GET RELIEF TO NO AVAIL. I BEGAN TO LOSE FEELING IN MY EXTREMITIES AND OFTEN HAD DISCOLORATION IN MY FINGERS, TOES, HANDS AND FEET.

BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE LABORATORY EVALUATION, PE IDENTIFIED THREE RENTS IN THE SHELL OF THE DEVICE. THE FIRST RENT MEASURED APPROXIMATELY .3CM IN LENGTH. THE TWO ADDITIONAL RENTS BOTH MEASURED APPROXIMATELY < .1CM IN THE SHELL OF THE DEVICE. AREAS OF SHELL WEAR WERE ALSO OBSERVED IN THE SHELL. ALTHOUGH THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE RENTS COULD NOT BE DETERMINED, SHELL WEAR SUGGEST IN-VIVO FOLDING OR CREASING OF THE DEVICE. NO OTHER ANOMALIES WERE OBSERVED. BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. RUPTURE CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION. RUPTURE IS A KNOWN COMPLICATION ASSOCIATED WITH THESE DEVICES AND IS REFERENCED IN OUR PIDS. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ACCORDING TO THE FDA, THE INCIDENCE OF ALCL IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST IMPLANTS IS ""A VERY SMALL FRACTION OF THE 5-10 MILLION WOMEN WHO HAVE RECEIVED BREAST IMPLANTS WORLDWIDE."" AN INVESTIGATION OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD REVEALED NO IRREGULARITIES. A REVIEW OF THE NC SYSTEM AND COMPLAINT DATABASE REVEALED NO OTHER COMPLAINTS OF THIS TYPE ASSOCIATED WITH LOT 5746123. THE MAIN SYMPTOMS OF ALCL IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS ARE LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT SWELLING AND PAIN IN THE VICINITY OF THE IMPLANT AND PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. MENTOR CONCURS WITH FDA'S POSITION THAT, ""BECAUSE THE RISK OF ALCL APPEARS VERY SMALL, FDA BELIEVES THAT THE TOTALITY OF EVIDENCE CONTINUES TO SUPPORT A REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT FDA-APPROVED BREAST IMPLANTS ARE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE WHEN USED AS LABELED.""

SINCE THE AGE OF 11, I DANCED IN A COMPANY, AND LATER, MOVED INTO TEACHING BALLET FOR A COMPETITIVE GYMNASTICS TEAM. OVER THE YEARS SINCE RECEIVING IMPLANTS MY HEALTH HAS STEADILY DECLINED AND ALL SYMPTOMS HAVE CONSISTENTLY WORSENED. THEY HAVE COME TO A HEAD DURING THE LAST 2 TO 3 YEARS. THE WORST PART OF THAT DECLINE IS SEVERE, DEBILITATING FATIGUE WITH SEVERE PAIN AND INJURY WITH ANY EXERTION AND HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, DEBILITATING MIGRAINES. BUT THOSE ARE CERTAINLY NOT MY ONLY SYMPTOMS. I HAVE BROUGHT MY ISSUES TO MY PCPS OVER THE LAST YEARS. THEY TESTED ME FOR A FEW POSSIBLE COMMON CAUSES, BUT COULDN'T FIND A REASON. EVENTUALLY, THEY JUST IGNORED THESE SYMPTOMS. I RECENTLY CHANGED PCPS AND MY NEW ONE BEGAN A DILIGENT PROCESS OF ELIMINATION. SHE HAS BEEN SENDING ME TO SPECIALISTS AND WE'VE BEEN DOING ONE TEST AFTER ANOTHER TO RULE THINGS OUT. THEY'VE ALL COME OUT NORMAL. UNTIL WE DID A BREAST ULTRASOUND. IT SHOWED SIGNS OF IMPLANT RUPTURE. I WAS SENT TO DO AN MRI, AND IT CONFIRMED IMPLANT RUPTURE. DUE TO MY MASTECTOMIES, I HAVE NO SENSATION IN MY BREAST OR ARMPIT AREAS, SO WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG AGO THE RUPTURE TOOK PLACE. BECAUSE SILENT RUPTURES ARE COMMON, THE RUPTURE COULD HAVE HAPPENED YEARS AGO. THE CHANGE IN SHAPE AND SIZE AND THEIR ASYMMETRY HAS BEEN NOTICEABLE FOR SOME YEARS, BUT MY PREVIOUS PCP HAD NO COMMENT ABOUT THAT. I AM EXTREMELY UPSET THAT I WAS NOT SENT FOR A BREAST ULTRASOUND OR OTHER RELATED TEST BY MY PREVIOUS PCP. ALL THE LITERATURE SAYS THAT PEOPLE WITH BREAST IMPLANTS SHOULD BE FOLLOWED ON A REGULAR BASIS. I AM EXTREMELY THANKFUL THAT I HAVE FOUND A DILIGENT PCP AND AN NOW IN GOOD CARE. I KNOW THAT A CONNECTION BETWEEN IMPLANTS AND RUPTURED IMPLANTS AND HEALTH ISSUES ISN'T SOMETHING THE MAJORITY OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION WANTS TO ADMIT, BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE CONNECTION IS REAL. SINCE DISCOVERING THAT MY IMPLANTS ARE RUPTURED, I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONNECT WITH OVER (B)(6) WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS OR RUPTURED IMPLANTS WHO ARE HAVING THE SAME SYMPTOMS I HAVE, AND MORE. MANY OF THEM ARE IN WORSE CONDITION THAN I AM. ALL OF US HAVE LOST QUALITY OF LIFE. A HUGE PERCENTAGE OF THEM REPORT THAT THEIR HEALTH ISSUES SUBSIDE AFTER HAVING THEIR IMPLANTS REMOVED. AND THESE ARE ONLY THE WOMEN WITH WHOM I HAVE CONNECTED. THERE MUST BE SO MANY MORE OUT THERE. THE WORST PART OF ALL THIS IS THAT OUR CONDITIONS ARE BEING IGNORED OR POO-POOED BY THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY SO THERE IS OFTEN NO HELP FOR US UNLESS AND UNTIL WE CAN FIND A DOCTOR WHO TAKES OUT HEALTH SERIOUSLY. I AM CURRENTLY WAITING FOR A DATE TO HAVE MY IMPLANTS REMOVED. I WILL NOT HAVE THEM REPLACED. I AM PRAYING THAT, ONCE THEY ARE REMOVED, I WILL BE ABLE TO REGAIN MY HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE.|SILTEX LB GEL-FILLED MAMMARY PROSTHESIS|354*2007|01/12/2016||||*|*||I|FWM|1.0||SILTEX LB GEL-FILLED MAMMARY PROSTHESIS||L13410|||||MENTOR MEDICAL SYSTEMS B.

IF I HAD KNOWN I WOULD BE FIGHTING FOR MY LIFE, I WOULD HAVE NEVER GOTTEN THESE. I HAVE THREE SMALL CHILDREN. I HAVE MYSTERIOUS RASHES, HAIR FALLING OUT, INFLAMMATION IN MY STOMACH, UTERUS, BLADDER, URINARY TRACT, KIDNEYS, MY GLANDS, GUMS, IN BETWEEN MY RIBS, AND NOW MY BRAIN AND SPINE ARE BECOMING AFFECTED. I KEEP GETTING INFECTIONS EVERYWHERE INCLUDING ONE THAT BECAME SO BAD I WAS HOSPITALIZED FOR SEPSIS. I CAN NO LONGER HOLD RELATIONSHIPS, REMEMBER IMPORTANT EVENTS, I RARELY GET OUT OF BED. I'M STUCK LIVING WITH THE PAIN OF INFLAMMATION, TERRIBLE JOINT PAIN, AND FATIGUE ALL BECAUSE I CANNOT AFFORD THE REMOVAL OF THESE AND CAN'T EVEN TAKE PAIN MEDICATIONS BECAUSE OF MY KIDNEY INVOLVEMENT. I UNDERSTAND I CHOSE TO GET THE IMPLANTS BUT I DID NOT REALIZE THE RISKS THAT WOULD COME WITH THEM. I'M TERRIFIED FOR MY LIFE. I'M TERRIFIED MY CHILDREN WILL BE LEFT WITH NO ONE. I PRAY YOU WORK ON GETTING SOME TYPE OF REPORT THAT DOCTORS HAVE TO GIVE TO ANY WOMAN INQUIRING ABOUT IMPLANTS. MY MOTHER IS ALSO ILL. SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN GENERALLY HEALTHY.

5808310|50110352|D|1||THOUSANDS OF KNOWN WOMEN ARE SICK FROM A SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. EACH OF THEM KNOWS THE TRUTH NOW. FDA HAS SOMEHOW ALLOWED THE SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT MFRS TO HIDE THE HIGH LEVEL OF TOXICITY OF SILICONE, PLATINUM AND OF THE OTHER 35 + DANGEROUS CHEMICALS THAT USE TO MAKE SILICONE AND SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS, THAT TRIGGER A BIOCHEMICAL MOLECULAR DISRUPTION THAT BRING UP SICKNESSES THAT WERE NOT PRESENT BEFORE THE IMPLANTS AND THAT GO AWAY AFTER THE EXPLANTS, WITH SOME CASES OF IRREVERSIBLE DAMAGE. ON NOVEMBER 17, 2006, THE FDA'S APPROVAL ORDER REQUIRED SIX VERY SPECIFIC POST-APPROVAL STUDIES CONDITIONS, TWO OF THE STUDIES TO MONITOR LONG TERM SAFETY FOR TEN YEARS. THEY WERE NOT FOLLOWED AND SO THERE IS NO SAFETY DATA FOR THOSE STUDIES. THE ADJUNCT 5-YEAR STUDY HAD A LOW F/U RATE OF 13.8%, THE LARGE STUDY WAS ALLOWED TO BE CUT SHORT AT YEAR 7 INSTEAD OF 10 WITH A LOW F/U RATE OF 20.1% AND IT WAS IGNORED, THE CORE STUDY HAD A F/U RATE OF 62% BUT THE REPORT SCHEDULE STOPS SHORT AT YEAR 6 INSTEAD OF 10 ON NOVEMBER 13, 2012. THE FDA MENTOR PMA, THE MANUFACTURE DOCUMENT, STATES SHELF LIFE TO BE FIVE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF STERILIZATION, YET THEY ARE MARKETED FOR UP TO 10 YEARS TO STAY IN THE BODY WITHOUT ANY SAFETY EVIDENCE. THE (B)(6) STUDY FROM 2013 RUN BY THE (B)(6), FUNDED BY THE THREE BREAST IMPLANT MFRS, DOES NOT QUALIFY AS AN INDEPENDENT STUDY FOR THE ASTOUNDING CONFLICT OF INTEREST IN REGARDS TO THE PLASTIC SURGEONS THAT PROFIT LARGELY FROM THE SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS AND, THE MFRS THEMSELVES THAT PROFIT FROM THEIR OWN SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. ALL THE PREVIOUS SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT SYMPTOMS FROM THE 1990S ARE REPEATING THEMSELVES WITH THE CURRENT SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS, THUS PROVING RECURRING LACK OF SAFETY. A FEW PEOPLE FOLLOWING THIS MATTER HAVE MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED, BUT NOW THOUSANDS OF WOMEN HAVE GROUPED TOGETHER TO SHARE THEIR RECORDS WITH (B)(6) AND FOR THEIR OWN PROTECTION THEY HAVE ALSO TAKEN MEASURES TO SHARE THEIR RECORDS AMONG THEMSELVES AND HAVE THOSE RECORDS SAFEGUARDED WITH THEIR OWN ATTORNEYS. PRIVATE INTERESTS CANNOT SILENCE OR BUY OUT RECORDED MEDICAL EVIDENCE FROM THOUSANDS OF SICK WOMEN FROM SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS ANY LONGER.

FINALLY IN (B)(6) 2015 AFTER A GENERAL SURGEON I WENT TO SEE, BECAUSE I HAD FOUND SWOLLEN AXILLARY LYMPH NODES, ORDERED A MRI WITH CONTRAST OF MY BREAST. IT WAS THERE THAT I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH RUPTURED BREAST IMPLANTS. BY THAT TIME I WAS IN AGONY WITH BREAST PAIN, HARDNESS, FEVERS, CHILLS AND MASTITIS. IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT TIME. I PRETTY MUCH HAD TO PUT MY LIFE ON HOLD WHILE I WAITED TO GET AN EXPLANT.

5801905|49945687|D|1||OVER THE LAST 15 YEARS MY HEALTH HAS DECLINED. THE FIRST 10 OF THOSE YEARS I DEVELOPED FATIGUE, HORMONAL IMBALANCES, REOCCURRING YEAST INFECTIONS, ACNE AND RANDOM PAIN THROUGHOUT MY BODY ALONG WITH VARIOUS OTHER UNEXPLAINED AILMENTS. THESE SYMPTOMS CONTINUALLY GOT WORSE AND MORE SYMPTOMS STARTED OCCURRING. THE PAST 4 YEARS I BEGIN HAVING SO MUCH PAIN IN MY FEET AND LEGS THAT I COULD BARELY WALK. I WAS TESTED FOR PLANTARS FASCIITIS WHICH CAME BACK NEGATIVE, PHYSICAL THERAPY AND CHIROPRACTIC APPOINTMENTS BECAUSE WAS TOLD POSSIBLE NERVE PINCH IN LOWER BACK. THREE YEARS AGO THE PAIN CREPT UP INTO MY HANDS AND ARMS AND CONTINUING THROUGHOUT MY WHOLE BODY FEELING AS THOUGH SOMEONE HAD DUMPED CHEMICAL ACID ON MY BODY TO THE POINT ALL I COULD DO IS LAY IN BED AT NIGHT AND WISH I WOULD DIE. IN APPROX (B)(6) 2014, MY WHOLE BODY DECIDED TO REACT BY NOT BEING UNABLE TO REGULATE ITS BODY TEMPERATURE, EXTREME DIZZINESS TO THE POINT OF BLACKOUTS, EXTREME FATIGUE TO WHERE I BARELY COULD FUNCTION FOR A FEW HOURS THEN WOULD HAVE TO SLEEP, I FELT AS THOUGH I WAS SUFFOCATING ALL THE TIME, MY HANDS BEGAN SHAKING TO THE POINT I COULD NOT HOLD MY PHONE OR A GLASS. I COULD NOT THINK CLEARLY AND WAS HAVING EXTREME MEMORY LOSS, I WENT FROM HAVING 20/20 VISION TO NEEDING TRIFOCALS IN A MATTER OF LESS THAN A YEAR. THE PAIN IN MY BODY GOT WORSE AND NEVER LET UP. I HAVE TO KEEP MY HOME AT ABOUT 68 DEGREES BECAUSE HEAT MAKES THE CHEMICAL ACID BURNING INCREASE 10 FOLD, I HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME LEAVING MY HOME BECAUSE I LIVE IN THE DESERT AND THE SUN LITERALLY MAKES MY SKIN FEEL AS THOUGH IT IS BLISTERING. BETWEEN (B)(6) 2014 AND (B)(6) 2015 I LOST (B)(6) POUNDS UNEXPLAINABLY. ON (B)(6) 2015 MY PRIMARY PHYSICIAN WROTE ME OUT OF WORK FOR A WEEK THEN 2 WEEKS THEN FOR AN UNDETERMINED AMOUNT OF TIME AND SAID I NEEDED TO SEE A NEUROLOGIST. I FOLLOWED UP WITH A NEUROLOGIST WHO SAID HE BELIEVED I HAD PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY, BUT PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY DID NOT FIT ALL THE SYMPTOMS I WAS HAVING. AT THIS POINT I STARTED GOING TO THE (B)(6) CLINIC IN LATE (B)(6) 2015 WHO BY JUST MY SYMPTOMS FIGURED I HAD EITHER LUPUS, MS, HODGKIN'S DISEASE, LYME DISEASE OR SOME OTHER AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE. THEY PERFORMED MULTIPLE MRI'S, CAT SCANS, PET SCANS, BLOOD AND URINE TESTS, NERVE TESTS, HEART TESTS, LUNG TESTS AND MANY OTHER TESTS TO TRY AND DETERMINE WHY I WAS SICK. THEY DID DETERMINE THAT MY BLOOD PRESSURE WAS EXTREMELY LOW AND WOULD BOTTOM OUT IF I STOOD OR MOVE TOO QUICKLY CAUSING THE DIZZINESS AND BLACKOUTS. WHICH IS OPPOSITE OF WHAT I WAS 4 YEARS AGO TAKING MEDICINE FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. THEY DETERMINED I HAD EARLY STAGES OF EMPHYSEMA AND COPD. THE PET SCAN SHOWED NO TYPE OF CANCER, AND MY BLOOD WORK CAME BACK FINE OTHER THAN MY C-REACTIVE PROTEIN WAS AT 18.
