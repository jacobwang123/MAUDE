THEY DISCOVERED 2 ENA RO+, MY IMMUNOLOGICAL SYSTEM RESPONDED, IN 2012 THEY TOOK THEM OUT DUE TO LOTS OF PAIN AND I WAS NOT ABLE TO WALK; I FELT LIKE I DIED. AFTER THE 7TH MONTH, THE BIOPSY SHOWED MUCOPURULENT MATERIAL ON THE LEFT AND MASTITIS ON THE RIGHT. I HAVE STUDIED AND THE NUMBER OF IMPLANTS THAT WERE DELIVERED ON ME AFTER THE 4 MONTHS OF OPERATION AT MY REQUEST. THANKS TO THE MAGNETIC RESONANCE WITH STIR TECHNIQUE, THEY COULD SEE THE DISASTER THAT REMAINS IN DRAWING THEM OUT AND I HAVE SPARSE MATERIALS ALL OVER THE PLACES, I HAVE THE PHOTO OF RESONANCE IF NECESSARY. TODAY, I AM ABOUT TO ENTER TO THE OPERATION ROOM IN ORDER FOR THEM TO DO BIOPSY ON ME FOR THE TERRIFYING IMAGES. BY THE MEANS OF COLON THROUGH THE HYDROCOLONIC THERAPY, THEY DREW ME MATERIAL NON COMPATIBLE WITH HUMAN CELLS. A TRUE DISASTER. I ASKED THE SURGEON THAT HE PUTS THE MATERIAL THAT IS BOUGHT. IN MY CASE AND HUNDREDS IN MY COUNTRY, NO ONE DELIVERED THE CERTIFICATE OF WHAT IS PLACED. I HAVE THE NUMBER OF IMPLANTS IN ORDER TO KNOW FOR SURE TO WHOM IT BELONGS AND TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THIS IMPLANT. MY HEALTH IS VERY DELICATE, WAITING FOR A NEW BIOPSY. MY EMAIL IS (B)(6). PLEASE CONTROL THE SURGEONS AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF THESE PRODUCTS. THE SURGEON WHO OPERATED ON ME IS DR. (B)(6). HE TOLD ME THAT IN THE CONSULTING OFFICE, THEY PLACE WHATEVER THEY WANT FOR MORE DOCUMENTATION. A SCARY DECLARATION. TODAY, I HAVE IRREVERSIBLE HEALTH PROBLEM. I WAIT FOR YOUR COMMENTS TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE INFORMATION IF IT MATCHES THE NUMBER OF MY IMPLANT WITH WHAT IS BEING SOLD. I HAVE IMAGES AND ANALYSIS RESULT TO SENT TO YOU IF NECESSARY. THE SAME SURGEON, IN 2009, INJECTED HYALURONIC ACID IN ME THAT WASN'T, IF NOT PLACED BIOPOLYMER MATERIAL. THEY DREW THE LEFT PAROTID AND THE BIOPSY THAT GAVE ABSORBED HISTIOCYTES FOREIGN MATERIAL.
