SO FAR THE TESTING HAS BEEN BASICALLY NEGATIVE WITH CERTAIN AREAS CAUSING QUESTIONS ABOUT HER HEALTH WHICH WERE NEVER DETERMINED. SHE ALSO HAD ELEVATED T CELLS THAT CAUSED CONCERN ABOUT HER THYROID. NUCLEAR TESTING PROVED TO BE NEGATIVE AS FAR AS A GROWTH. RPTR ALSO C/O FATIGUE, GENERAL PAIN IN JOINTS, MUSCLES, A STROKE-LIKE INCIDENT THAT CAUSED HER LEFT SIDE TO BE NUMB, LEFT SIDE OF FACE DROOPING. EVALUATION AND A CAT SCAN WERE DONE WHICH SHOWED NOTHING. INCIDENT WAS GENERALIZED AS ""BELL'S PALSY"" BUT WAS DISPUTED AS A DIAGNOSIS BY ANOTHER PHYSICIAN SINCE THE ARM AND FACE BOTH ARE NOT AFFECTED BY BELL'S PALSY. RPTR HAD SEVERAL SITUATIONS IN WHICH PALPITATIONS WERE A PROBLEM, BECAME EXTREME AND CAUSED THE NEED FOR A BETA BLOCKER. THESE SYMPTOMS HAVE CAUSED GREAT DISTRESS AND PAIN, ALONG WITH GENERAL CONFUSION OF WHAT WAS GOING ON PHYSICALLY. LAST JULY OR AUGUST RPTR FINALLY WAS CONFRONTED WITH THE IMPLANT RUPTURE SITUATION. SHE COULD SEE A DEFINITE SIZE CHANGE, HER HEALTH HAD EXTREMELY DETERIORATED THIS LAST YR, DISTORTION OF LEFT SIDE,  ETC. SHE HAD RESPIRATORY FAILURE DIAGNOSED AS PNEUMONIA ALONG WITH ASTHMA, FOR WHICH SHE HAD NEVER BEEN DIAGNOSED PREVIOUSLY, BUT OVER THE YRS ALLERGIES/ALLERGY REACTIONS HAVE INCREASED. RPTR CANNOT BE IN A ROOM WHERE SOMEONE IS SMOKING A PIPE OR CIGAR. SHE IMMEDIATELY STARTS LOSING HER BREATH AND HAVING AN ASTHMA ATTACK. RPTR WAS NEVER WARNED THAT SHE COULD HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM BECAUSE OF THE IMPLANTATION OF SILICONE. RPTR'S DAUGHTER EVEN CONFRONTED THE DR WITH THE QUESTION ""COULD THIS BE SILICONE RELATED SINCE PUBLIC WAS GETTING FEEDBACK THAT THERE WAS A POTENTIAL PROBLEM."" THE IDEA WAS THROWN OUT COMPLETELY BY THE DR. DURING THE LAST COUPLE OF YRS, RPTR HAS PROGRESSIVELY GOTTEN WORSE AND CANNOT EVEN OPEN A JAR WITHOUT PAIN. THE FATIGUE IS EXTREME AND SHE IS USUALLY IN BED BY EARLY EVENING TO REST. SHE CANNOT CARRY GROCERIES.

12391|8696|D|1||IN 7/75, RPTR WENT TO HOSP FOR BREAST AUGMENTATION SURGERY. AFTER RECEIVING A DISSATISFYING MASTOPEXY, SHE UNDERWENT A SECOND OPERATION AT THE SAME HOSP TO HAVE SILICONE IMPLANTS PLACED IN BOTH BREASTS. SOON AFTER THE SECOND OPERATION THE IMPLANTS HARDENED IN BOTH BREASTS AND THE DR BEGAN PERFORMING A SQUEEZING TECHNIQUE TO BREAK UP THE SCAR TISSUE THAT HAD CAUSED THE IMPLANTS TO BECOME ENCAPSULATED. DURING ONE OF THE SQUEEZING EPISODES, THE LEFT BREAST IMPLANT RUPTURED AND A LOCAL OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN THE DR'S OFFICE WAS DONE TO REMOVE THE DAMAGED IMPLANT AND HE REPLACED IT WITH ANOTHER IMPLANT. EVENTUALLY, AFTER THE THIRD OPERATION, THE IMPLANTS HARDENED AGAIN CAUSING HER TREMENDOUS UNHAPPINESS. HAVING THE BREAST HARDEN AND THEN SQUEEZED BY THE DR WAS EXTREMELY DEMEANING AND PAINFUL AND CAUSED HER DISTRESS AND MENTAL ANGUISH. THIS PROBLEM CONTINUED THROUGHOUT THE NEXT THREE YRS, UNTIL ON ONE OFFICE VISIT WHEN HE WAS PERFORMING THE SQUEEZING TECHNIQUE THE LEFT IMPLANT RUPTURED ONCE MORE AND THIS TIME HE REQUESTED THAT RPTR MEET HIM AT HOSP WERE DR, HIS WIFE, AND A RN PERFORMED THE FOURTH OPERATION TO REMOVE THE RUPTURED SILICONE IMPLANT. HE DIDN'T REPLACE IT LEAVING HER WITH THE RIGHT BREAST A 34C AND THE LEFT BREAST A 34B, IN WHICH SHE USES VARIOUS PROSTHESIS TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LACK OF MASS IN THE LEFT BREAST. FOR THE LAST 17 YRS, SHE HAS HAD TO LIVE WITH AN ENCAPSULATED RIGHT IMPLANT SEALED TO THE UPPER CAVITY OF HER CHEST, HATING EVERY MINUTE IT HAS BEEN IN HER BODY. RPTR STATES THE MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL STRESS HAS BEEN HORRENDOUS TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT WHAT IT HAS CAUSED HER IMMUNE SYSTEM. SHE SUFFERS DAILY FROM RESPIRATORY ALLERGIES AND HAS TO USE ANTIHISTAMINES AND NASAL SPRAYS. INITIALLY, SHE WENT IN FOR  WHAT SHE THOUGHT WAS A SIMPLE PROCEDURE THAT WOULD ENHANCE HER SELF-ESTEEM AND THE WHOLE EPISODE RESULTED IN HER LOOKING LIKE A FREAK. RPTR FEELS THESE IMPLANTS CONTRIBUTED TO THE DESTRUCTION OF HER SANITY. ASIDE FROM THE DISCOMFORT AND THE PHYSICAL DEFORMITY, SHE THINKS THE KNOWLEDGE OF HER FEELING INHUMAN STEMMED FROM THIS HARD FOREIGN OBJECT BEING IN HER BODY AND CAUSED THE MOST PROBLEMS.

29756|17587|D|1||"RPTR HAD 7 AUGMENTATIONS FROM 1974 TO 1990. SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDED INFECTION, RUPTURE, CHRONIC PAIN AND FATIGUE, CHRONIC INFLAMMATION, SPEECH AND VISION PROBLEMS, DISCHARGE FROM NIPPLE, HUMAN ADJUVANT DISEASE, FIBROMYALGIA. ACCORDING TO A MEDICAL AND NEUROLOGIC EVALUATION 1/30/95: PT REPORTS BEING IN HER USUAL EXCELLENT STATE OF MEDICAL, NEUROLOGIC, AND PSYCHIATRIC HEALTH WHEN SHE CONSULTED THE DR FOR COSMETIC AUGMENTATION MAMMOPLASTY WITH INSERTION OF BILATERAL SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS. SHE DEVELOPED SOME IMMEDIATE DECREASED SENSATION IN THE NIPPLES, WHICH WITH TIME CHANGED TO A MILD HYPERSENSITIVITY. OTHERWISE, THERE WERE NO IMMEDIATE COMPLICATIONS FROM THIS SURGERY. HOWEVER, ONE WEEK LATER, PT WAS INVOLVED IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT. SHE IMMEDIATELY DEVELOPED BURNING PAIN IN HER BREASTS, AND IMPLANTS WERE KNOCKED INTO NEW POSITIONS, WITH ONE OBVIOUSLY AT A DIFFERENT LEVEL THAN THE OTHER. NO IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION WAS ATTEMPTED, WITH THE HOPE THAT WITH TIME IMPLANTS WOULD RELOCATE TO A BETTER POSITION ON THEIR OWN. HOWEVER, INSTEAD, BOTH IMPLANTS HARDENED MARKEDLY, ESPECIALLY ON THE RIGHT, AND DID NOT IMPROVE IN PLACEMENT. DUE TO THE UNACCEPTABLE HARDENING AND PLACEMENT, PT WAS REOPERATED IN 1975, WITH FINDINGS OF BILATERAL IMPLANT RUPTURE. NEW IMPLANTS WERE PLACED AT THAT TIME. SHORTLY THEREAFTER, BOTH IMPLANTS HARDENED, ESPECIALLY ON THE RIGHT, AND SEVERAL CLOSED CAPSULOTOMIES WERE PERFORMED, WHICH EVENTUALLY SOFTENED THE LEFT IMPLANT, BUT COULD NOT EFFECTIVELY SOFTEN THE RIGHT ONE. IN 1978, THE RIGHT IMPLANT AND EXTENSIVE SCAR TISSUE WERE REMOVED AND A NEW IMPLANT PLACED ON THE RIGHT. THIS IMPLANT AGAIN MARKEDLY HARDENED AND WAS REPLACED AGAIN IN 1979, 1982, AND 1982, WITH SEVERE RE-HARDENING AND PAIN EACH TIME. STINGING AND BURNING PAINS IN THE CHEST AND BREAST AREAS PERSISTED. BETWEEN 1985 AND 1990, THERE WAS AGAIN SEVERE RE-HARDENING ON THE RIGHT ""LIKE A ROCK."" IN 1990, PT HAD BOTH IMPLANTS REMOVED AND NEW IMPLANTS PLACED. IN ADDITION TO THE HARDENING, PT DEVELOPED A RIGHT NIPPLE DISCHARGE FROM THE LATE 1970S UP UNTIL THE 1990 SURGERY. WITH REGARDS TO THE MEDICAL CONDITIONS AND CHARACTERISTICS OUTLINE OF DEFINITIONS AND CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA TO THE GLOBAL RESOLUTION OF BREAST IMPLANT CLAIMS, THE PT INITIALLY MET AT LEAST FIVE CRITERIA FOR CATEGORY ATYPICAL CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE/ATYPICAL RHEUMATIC SYNDROME/NON-SPECIFIC AUTOIMMUNE CONDITION BY 1975. SHE HAS MANIFESTED THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA: POLYARTHRALGIAS, POLYMYALGIAS, IMMUNE MEDIATED SKIN CHANGES, PULMONARY SYMPTOMS WITH FREQUENT UPPER RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS, MEMORY AND CONCENTRATION PROBLEMS, HEADACHES, PANIC ATTACKS, PARESTHESIAS, AND HEMIFACIAL SPASM, CHRONIC FATIGUE, ALOPECIA, SLEEP DISTURBANCES, SUSTAINED BALANCE PROBLEMS, EASY BRUISABILITY, COLITIS/IRRITABLE BOWELS, PERSISTENT LOW GRADE FEVER, PERSISTENT DRENCHING NIGHT SWEATS, BURNING BREAST AND CHEST PAIN WITH BREAST DISFIGUREMENT.

SHE LOOKED LIKE SILICONE HAD FUSED TO THE LOWER HALF OF HER BODY - SIMILAR TO BURN SCARS. SHE HAD NO GENITALS, RATHER JUST LIMBS WITH TISSUE ON THEM. IT LOOKED AS IF THE SILICONE GOT INTERTWINED WITH THE DEVELOPING CELLS AND DEVELOPED IN WITH HER BODY. THIS CREATED THE STOMACH AND LIVER TO BE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BODY. THE CHEST WALL WAS MESSED UP. THE HEART WAS COVERED WITH TISSUE, YET ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BODY CAVITY. THE SPINE WAS CURVED BACKWARDS. SHE WAS GLUED TO MY UTERINE WALLS AND HAD TO BE PLIED OFF OF THEM UPON DELIVERY. IT WAS AS IF SILICONE WAS IN MY UTERUS AND SHE GOT CAUGHT UP IN THE WEB AS SHE STARTED TO DEVELOP. I SUSPECTED I HAD A RUPTURED IMPLANT DURING PREGNANCY, HOWEVER, IT DID NOT OCCUR TO ME THAT THE SILICONE COULD HAVE MIGRATED AND CAUSED A PROBLEM. IT DID NOT OCCUR TO ME THAT THIS COULD CAUSE ANY BIRTH DEFECTS BECAUSE I HAD BEEN TOLD THERE WAS NO WAY IT WOULD RUPTURE, IF IT DID IT WOULD JUST ABSORB INTO THE BODY AND BE OK.

161779|21378512|D|1||RPTR HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO REMOVE ANOTHER DEFLATED IMPLANT THIS PAST SATURDAY. IT HAD BEEN IN PLACE QUITE SATISFACTORILY FOR THREE YRS PREVIOUS. RPTR USED THE SAME TECHNIQUE FOR ITS REMOVAL AS FOR ITS ORIGINAL IMPLANT, THAT IS AN INFERIOR SEMI-CIRUM AREOLAR TRANS GLANDULAR, SUB PECTORAL APPROACH. AS RPTR REACHED THE BOTTOM OF THE BREAST TISSUE AND THE PECTORAL FASCIA, RPTR ENCOUNTERED A CYSTIC STRUCTURE AND WHEN DR DIVIDED THIS THEY DRAINED APPROX 30 CC'S OF SALINE. DIRECTLY BENEATH THIS WAS THE VALVE OF THE IMPLANT. THE TISSUE INGROWTH HAD BEEN LIFTED FOR AN AREA OF APPROX 2 TO 3 CM AROUND THE VALVE. THE REMAINDER OF THE IMPLANT WAS DENSELY, REPEAT DENSELY, ADHERENT TO THE TISSUES TO THE EXTENT THAT WHEN RPTR WAS ATTEMPTING TO SEPARATE IT BY DIGITAL DISSECTION, THEY TORE THE IMPLANT IN THE 10 TO 11 O'CLOCK AREA. DR THINKS BECAUSE OF THE DENSE ADHERENCE OF THE TISSUE AND THE BUBBLE DIRECTLY OVER THE VALVE THAT THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT THIS WAS A VALVE LEAKAGE. UNLIKE PREVIOUS VALVE LEAKAGES THAT RPTR HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO REMOVE, THIS DID NOT HAVE TISSUE INGROWTH AROUND THE STIRRUP. THERE WAS NO OBVIOUS TISSUE IN THE VALVE.

161759|107204|D|1||RPTR HAS COMPLETED REPLACING A DEFLATED BREAST PROSTHESIS. ONLY A FEW MOS AGO RPTR HAD TO REPLACE THE LEFT PROSTHESIS ON THIS PT. AS RPTR HAS IN THE PAST, RPTR ONCE AGAIN FOUND THAT THE TISSUE OF THE CAPSULE HAD GROWN AROUND THE STIRRUP, PULLING THE PLUG OUT OF THE VALVE. SINCE THE REMAINDER OF THE IMPLANT REMAINS INTACT, IT IS DR'S INTERPRETATION THAT THE VALVE FAILED AGAIN. BECAUSE OF DR'S UNFORTUNATE FREQUENT ENCOUNTERS WITH THIS EXACT PROBLEM RPTR WOULD ASK THAT MFR CONSIDER REDESIGNING THE VALVE SO THAT INSTEAD OF HAVING A STIRRUP, THE PLUG IS SECURED ON A FLAP OF SILASTIC ROUGHLY SQUARE OR RECTANGULAR, OR EVEN CIRCULAR IN SHAPE AND SECURED TO THE SHELL OF THE IMPLANT ON AT LEAST TWO SIDES IF IT IS SQUARE OR RECTANGULAR AND JUST GREATER THEN 180 DEGREES IF IT IS CIRCULAR. IN RPTR'S OPINION THIS WOULD SERVE TWO PURPOSES. THE FIRST WOULD BE TO PREVENT THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS KIND OF INGROWTH THAT COULD PULL THE PLUG AND THE SECOND WOULD BE IN CASES WHERE THERE IS LIMITED EXPOSURE IT WOULD DEFINE THE ORIENTATION OF AN ASYMMETRICAL IMPLANT SUCH AS FLAT TOPS.|NI|NI|03/25/1998|I|||*||157501.0|0HP|FWM|1.0||SALINE BREAST IMPLANT|Y|NI|700 WARD DR.||SANTA BARBARA|US|MCGHAN MEDICAL||CA|93111||NI|NI|True

178340|119725|D|1||"READS: ""ANATOMICALLY SHAPED BREAST IMPLANTS MADE BY MCGHAN MED. THESE BREAST IMPLANTS ARE SALINE FILLED-SILICONE ENVELOPES. IN 1976 MFR'S WERE PERMITTED TO MFR AND SELL BREAST IMPLANTS BY FDA. IN THE SAME YR FDA REQUIRED MFR'S TO SHOW RESEARCHED DATA TO SUPPORT THE USE OF BREAST IMPLANTS. UNTIL THIS RESEARCH COMES OUT, WOMEN PLANNING TO USE BREAST IMPLANTS NEED TO HAVE THE FOLLOWING INFO. BEFORE SURGERY IS SCHEDULED WOMEN NEED TO DISCUSS THE PROS AND CONS OF HAVING BREAST IMPLANTS. BREAST IMPLANTS CAN IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE. PLAY AN IMPORTANT PART IN THE RECOVERY OF WOMEN DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER. SOME WOMEN FIND EXTERNAL BREAST FORMS TO BE SATISFACTORY. TISSUES FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY CAN BE USED TO RECONSTRUCT BREAST. THIS REQUIRES A LONGER OPERATION, LONGER HEALING TIME. BREAST IMPLANT SURGERIES PRESENT THE SAME RISKS AS OTHER SURGERIES, EG ANESTHESIA RELATED RISKS. BREAST IMPLANTS CAN'T BE EXPECTED TO LAST FOREVER. THEY DEFLATE, RUPTURE FOR DIFFERENT REASONS. THEY CAN DEFLATE DUE TO WEAR WITH TIME, RUPTURE DUE TO INJURY. IT IS NOT KNOWN WHEN DEFLATION OCCURS. IT HAS BEEN FOUND THROUGH RESEARCH: WHEN THE SALINE LEAKS IT IS ABSORBED IN THE BODY BECAUSE NORMAL SALINE ALREADY EXISTS IN THE BODY. BREAST IMPLANTS NEED TO BE REMOVED WHEN WORN OUT, MAKE MAMMOGRAPHY DIFFICULT, WOMAN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS RECEIVE MORE RADIATION, THE FORMALIAR OF CAPSULES AROUND THE IMPLANT CAUSES CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CALCIUM DEPOSITS NEED TO BE IDENTIFIED FROM THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH CANCER, INFECTION CAN OCCUR, ESPECIALLY WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF THE OPERATION. INFECTION WITH IMPLANTS ARE HARDER TO TREAT THAN INFECTIONS WITH NORMAL TISSUE. RISK OF HAVING A HEMATOMA: CHANCES OF OCCURRING NOT KNOWN BUT USUALLY OCCURS AFTER SURGERY. SMALL HEMATOMAS CAN BE ABSORBED BY THE BODY, BUT LARGE ONES ARE SURGICALLY DRAINED WHICH CAUSES SCARRING. RESEARCH CONTINUES TO INDICATE THAT FEELING OF PAIN, BURNING SENSTAION MAY INTERFEAR WITH BREAT FEEDING AND SEXUAL RESPONSE. MANY FEEL IMPLANT SHIFTINGS AND FEEL IMPLANT THROUGH THE SKIN. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES LIKE LUPUS, SCLERODERMA, RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND NEUROLOGIC SYMPTOMS SEEN IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PT'S. IN SOME CASES THE SALINE USED HAS BEEN KNOWN TO BE CONTAMINATED WITH BACTERIA. IF SO, ORGANISMS MAY BE RELEASED IN THE BODY IF HER IMPLANTS DEFLATE. ACCORDING TO SCIENTIFIC STUDIES WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS IN GENERAL ARE NOT AT AN INCREASED RISK FOR AUTOIMMUNE OR SELECTIVE TISSUE DISEASES. HOWEVER, THESE STUDIES ARE TOO SMALL TO DETECT WETHER THERE MIGHT BE A SLIGHTLY INCREASED RISK OF ANY OF THESE RARE DISEASES. ALSO THESE CURRENT STUDIES HAVE LOOKED ONLY FOR THE SYMPTOMS OF KNOWN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES, RATHER THAN THE VARIETY OF SYMPTOMS THAT SOME WOMEN ARE EXPERIENCING. SUCH AS SWELLING, JOINT PAIN, ARTHRITIS LIKE PAIN, GENERAL ACHING, UNUSUAL HAIR LOSS, UNEXPLAINED OR UNUSUAL LOSS OF ENERGY, GREATER CHANCE OF GETTING COLDS, VIRUSES, AND FLU SWOLLEN GLANDS OR LYMPH NODES."|ANATOMICALLY SHAPED BREAST IMPLANTS||07/22/1998|A|||*||173408.0||FWM|1.0||BREAST IMPLANTS|Y||700 WARD DR.||SANTA BARBARA|US|MCGHAN MEDICAL CORP.||CA|93111||||True

TO MAKE MY BREAST EQUAL IN SIZE, IN 1981, I WAS 25 YEARS OLD, I SUBMITTED TO BREAST IMPLANT OPERATION. BECAUSE THE DOCTORS, ALL ASSURED ME THAT IMPLANTS WERE SAFE. AND THE SILICONE WAS NOT ANY HARMFUL. I FURTHER ASKED HIM ABOUT THE SAFETY OF BREAST FEEDING MY FUTURE CHILDREN AND HE ASSURED ME, IT WAS SAFE. HE STATED THAT HIS WIFE TOO, HAD BREAST IMPLANT AND SHE BREAST FED THEIR CHILDREN. HE ALSO STATED THAT THE FDA HAD APPROVED OF THE PRODUCT SAFETY. NOTHING CAN BE SOLD TO THE PUBLIC WITHOUT APPROVAL FOR PRODUCT SAFETY. SO DON'T BE AFRAID. IT'S SAFE, IT'S FOR LIFE TIME. NOTHING COULD GO WRONG WITH SILICONE, MANY WOMEN HAVE IT, AND THEY ARE O.K.

234017|140494|D|1||"AFTER IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED, THE ANTERIOR CAPSULES WERE REMOVED. ATTEMPTING TO REMOVE THE POSTERIOR CAPSULE RESULTED IN BLEEDING, SO THE POSTERIOR CAPSULES AND CHEST WALL WERE LEFT IN PLACE. 6 MOS AFTER EXPLANTATION, BREASTS BECAME SWOLLEN AND SEVERELY PAINFUL - SO TENDER THAT CLOTHES COULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO TOUCH THEM. USER WENT TO PAIN CLINIC FOR 2 YEARS, RECEIVED PAIN MEDICATION, ADD'L SURGERY AND WAS REFERRED TO HAVE A NEUROLOGY CONSULTATION. THE PAIN MEDICATION AND TREATMENTS HAVEN'T BEEN EFFECTIVE SO FAR, BUT THE DRS PERSIST IN TRYING TO HELP. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: BILATERAL CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. MATERIAL FORWARDED TO LAB FOR EXAMINATION: 1. IMPLANT RIGHT BREAST. 2. IMPLANT LEFT BREAST. 3. RIGHT BREAST IMPLANT CAPSULE. 4. LEFT BREAST IMPLANT CAPSULE. OPERATION PERFORMED: EXPLANTATION AND ANTERIOR CAPSULECTOMY BILATERAL BREASTS. DATE OF OPERATION: 1996. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: INDICATIONS: THIS PT IS A 45-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH A HISTORY OF BILATERAL IMPLANTS AFTER SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMIES IN 1984. SHE HAS HAD INCREASE IN DISTORTION AND PAIN OVER ONE YEAR AND WISHES TO HAVE THE IMPLANTS REMOVED. I HAVE DISCUSSED MULTIPLE RECONSTRUCTIVE OPTIONS WITH THIS PT IN DETAIL AND AT THIS TIME SHE CURRENTLY WISHES TO HAVE EXPLANT ONLY. PROCEDURE: THE PT WAS BROUGHT IN THE OR AND PLACED IN A SUPINE POSITION WHERE SATISFACTORY GENERAL ENDOTRACHEAL ANESTHESIA WAS PERFORMED. SHE WAS THEN PREPPED AND DRAPED IN THE NORMAL STERILE MANNER. AFTER STERILE PREPPING AND DRAPING, AN INCISION WAS PERFORMED ON THE RIGHT BREAST LATERALLY THROUGH THE OLD MASTECTOMY INCISION. DISSECTION WAS CARRIED DOWN THROUGH SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE TO THE IMPLANT. THE IMPLANT AND IMPLANT GAPS WERE DISSECTED FREE SUPERIORLY, MEDIALLY AND LATERALLY AND WHEN THE LIMITS OF DISSECTION WERE REACHED THE CAPSULE WAS OPENED AND THE IMPLANT WAS REMOVED. THE IMPLANT WAS NOTED TO BE INTACT BUT WAS NOTED TO BE A MCGHAN 320 CC IMPLANT. THE ANTERIOR CAPSULE WAS THEN REMOVED AND THE POSTERIOR CAPSULE AND THE CHEST WALL WERE LEFT INTACT, AS THERE WAS NO RUPTURE AND ATTEMPTING TO GET THIS CAPSULE OFF RESULTED IN SOME BLEEDING. THEREFORE, THIS WAS ABANDONED. ATTENTION WAS DIRECTED TO THE CONTRALATERAL SIDE, WHERE A SIMILAR INCISION WAS MADE AND DISSECTION ONCE AGAIN CARRIED DOWN THROUGH SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE TO THE IMPLANT CAPSULE. DISSECTION AGAIN PROCEEDED SUPERIORLY, MEDIALLY AND LATERALLY AND THE IMPLANT CAPSULE WAS OPENED AND INTACT IMPLANT WAS REMOVED. THIS WAS ALSO A MCGHAN 320 CC IMPLANT. THE ANTERIOR CAPSULE WAS THEN REMOVED. THE WOUNDS WERE THOROUGHLY AND COPIOUSLY IRRIGATED AND A JACKSON-PRATT DRAIN WAS PLACED THROUGH A SEPARATE STAB INCISION; AND THE WOUND WAS CLOSED IN LAYERS. THE DEEP TISSUE WAS CLOSED USING INTERRUPTED 4-0 VICRYL. DEEP DERMIS WAS CLOSED USING 4-0 VICRYL AND THE SKIN WAS CLOSED USING A RUNNING 6-0 NYLON. THE PT TOLERATED THE PROCEDURE WELL AND WAS EXTUBATED IN THE OR AND WAS TAKEN TO THE RECOVERY ROOM IN STABLE CONDITION. DOCTOR'S PROGRESS NOTE STATES ""PT S/P REMOVAL OF RT BREAST IMPLANT IN 1996. PT STATES RT BREAST BECAME SORE LAST NIGHTIN INFERIOR AND SUPERIOR ASPECT OF RT BREAST. PT STATES WHOLE BREAST IS NOW VERY SORE AND NOW IT RADIATES TO RT AXILLA AND BACK. PT DESCRIBES PAIN AND CONSTANT 'BURNING LIKE IT IS ON FIRE'.  PT STATES LEFT SIDE IS NOW STARTING TO HURT. SHE NOTICED THE RT BREAST WAS RED AND REDDNESS HAS SPREAD. PT ALSO HAS EDEMA OF RT BREAST. PT DENIES LEFT BREAST DISCOLORATION. NO DISCHARGE. NO FEVERS, POSITIVE CHILLS. PT DENIES SHRTNESS OF BREATH. PT W/ UPPER RESPIRATORY INFECTION SYMPTOMS SINCE THIS MORNING. NO KNOWN TRAUMA. PT ON 'NEURONTIN' FROM PAIN CLINICWHICH HELPS A LITTLE. PT HASN'T TRIED ANYTHING ELSE FOR PAIN. PT STATES IT GOES ACROSS STERNUM."""|BREAST IMPLANTS|2575820|07/28/1999|M|||Y||226817.0|0LP|FTR|1.0||SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT|Y|STYLE 75|700 WARD DR.||SANTA BARBARA|US|MCGHAN MEDICAL CORP.||CA|93111||3M 29-76320 320/360CC|INVOICE NO. 03774|True

ON 6/6/94, PT DIAGNOSED AS HAVING ATYPICAL CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE); 359. DISABILITY IN 1988 AT AGE 60 FOR GLOBAL SETTLEMENT. PHYSICIAN WRITES, ""I AM A PHYSICIAN, BOARD CERTIFIED IN RHEUMATOLOGY AND INTERNAL MEDICINE. I HAVE SEEN THE PT FOR EVAL OF HER GENERAL MEDICAL STATUS AS RELATED TO HER SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. BASED ON THIS ASSESSMENT, THIS WOMAN HAS HAD THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS WHICH HAVE ARISEN SINCE THE TIME HER IMPLANTS WERE PLACED: ATYPICAL CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA. GROUP I (A.): 3. KERATOCONJUNCTIVITIS SICCA WITH DRY EYES, DRY MOUTH, DOCUMENTED BY ANOTHER DR. GROUP II (B.): - IMMUNE MEDIATED SKIN CHANGES MANIFESTING AS MACULAR RASH WITH SOME ULCERATION. - SEROLOGIC ABNORMALITIES INCLUDING POSITIVE ANA (HEP II) AT 1:320 TITER, SPECKLED PATTERN. GROUP III (C.): 1. DOCUMENTED ARTHRALGIA. 2. DOCUMENTED MYALGIAS. 3. CHRONIC FATIGUE (GREATER THAN 6 MONTHS). 5. DOCUMENTED NEUROLOGICAL SYMPTOMS INCLUDING COGNITIVE, DYSFUNCTION AND PARESTHESIA. 8. DOCUMENTED DYSPHAGIA. 9. DOCUMENTED ALOPECIA. 11. DOCUMENTED SLEEP DISTURBANCES. 13. DOCUMENTED CHRONIC CYSTITIS OR BLADDER IRRITABILITY. 17. BURNING PAIN IN THE CHEST, BREAST AND ARMS. BASED ON THIS ASSESSMENT, THIS WOMAN HAS AT LEAST 1 FROM GROUP I (A), 1 FROM GROUP II (B), AND 9 FROM GROUP III (C), AND THEREFORE MEETS THE SCHEDULE CRITERIA FOR ATYPICAL CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE. THE DATE OF ONSET OF THE QUALIFYING SYMPTOMS AND CURRENT LEVEL OF DISABILITY WAS IN 1988 AT AGE 60. 1. HER IMPLANTS WERE PLACED IN 1978. 2. THEY WERE REMOVED 1991. I HAVE THE INFO NECESSARY TO FORM A PROFESSIONAL OPINION ABOUT THE PT'S DISABILITY, WHICH IS BASED ON MY EXAMINATION OF THE PT, INCLUDING A MEDICAL HISTORY AND ASSESSMENT OF HER FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY, AND ON THE PT'S MEDICAL RECORDS. THIS PT IS IN SEVERITY/DISABILITY COMPENSATION CATEGORY B, 35% DISABLED, DUE TO THE COMPENSABLE CONDITION, BECAUSE SHE DEMONSTRATES A LOSS OF FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY WHICH RENDERS HER UNABLE TO PERFORM SOME OF HER USUAL ACTIVITIES OF VOCATION, AVOCATION AND SELF-CARE. OTHER MEDICAL PROBLEMS WHICH ARE UNRELATED OR ONLY INDIRECTLY RELATED TO HER IMPLANTS CONTRIBUTE TO DISABILITY EXTENDING BEYOND THE 35% LEVEL."" PHYSICIAN WRITES, ""I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST POINT OUT THAT I INITIALLY SAW AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONSULTANT DURING HER HOSPITALIZATION IN JUNE OF 1978. AT THAT TIME, SHE HAD UNDERGONE BILATERAL BREAST REMOVAL WITH THE SUBSEQUENT REPLACEMENT OF SILASTIC IMPLANTS. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING SURGERY, SHE DEVELOPED A FEVER THAT PERSISTED. NO OBVIOUS SIGN OF INFECTION WAS DETECTED. AT THE TIME I SAW HER, HER FEVER WAS IN THE RANGE OF 101-102 AND HAD REMAINED IN THAT RANGE FOR THE PREVIOUS 7-10 DAYS, DESPITE PERIODS OF ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY, INCLUDING BOTH KEFLEX AND KEFLIN. THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT ABNORMALITY FOUND AT THAT TIME WAS A SLIGHT ELEVATION OF HER ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE, LDH, AND SGOT. ON THAT BASIS, SEROLOGIC STUDIES FOR POSSIBLE CAUSES OF HEPATITIS WERE UNDERTAKEN AND WERE ALL WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS. HOWEVER, SUBSEQUENT CONVALESCENT TITERS WERE OBTAINED, AND A RISE IN TITER OF CYTOMEGALY VIRUS SEROLOGY BETWEEN JULY 3 AND JULY 12, 1978, SHOWED A RISE FROM LESS THAN 1:8 TO A TITER OF 1:256. THIS SEROLOGIC CHANGE IS DIAGNOSTIC FOR CYTOMEGALOVIRUS, AND THEREFORE, I FEEL THE DIAGNOSIS OF CYTOMEGALOVIRUS HEPATITIS WAS ESTABLISHED. I HAVE SEEN HER IN FOLLOWUP, AT WHICH TIME HER LIVER FUNCTION TESTS HAVE RESOLVED COMPLETELY. SHE HAS SUBSEQUENTLY UNDERGONE A REVISION OF HER MAMMOPLASTY. PARENTHETICALLY, I WOULD POINT OUT THAT AS PART OF HER INITIAL WORK-UP, THERE WAS SOME CONCERN AS TO WHETHER SHE WAS HAVING A REACTION TO THE MATERIAL OF THE ORIGINAL IMPLANTS, AND THEREFORE, THESE WERE REMOVED, TO BE REPLACED APPROX ONE MONTH AGO. SHE HANDLED THE SECOND SURGERY VERY WELL, INDEED, AND AT THIS STAGE, TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE, IS TOTALLY ASYMPTOMATIC."""|MCGHAN|25-20-240|03/20/1999|M|||N||210148.0|0LP|FTR|1.0||SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS|Y|UNK|700 S.

AFTER HAVING MY SECOND DAUGHTER IN 7/71, THE PROBLEMS I HAD WITH BOTH MY BREASTS WERE GETTING WORSE. HAVING BEEN SEEN BY MY GENERAL PRACTITIONER, I WAS SENT FOR SCAN ON BOTH BREASTS. FIBROCYSTIC MASTITIS WAS DIAGNOSED; I ALSO HAD GREEN FLUID OOZING FROM BOTH NIPPLES ACCOMPANIED WITH SEVERE PAIN. THE TREATMENT I WAS ON WAS DANAZOL, BUT TO NO AVAIL. I SAW MY GENERAL PRACTITIONER AGAIN WHO THEN MADE ME APPOINTMENT TO SEE BREAST SURGEON. I HAD NO FURTHER SCANS THAT REVEALED I HAD FIBROCYSTIC MASTITIS; BY THAT TIME FLUID FROM BOTH MY NIPPLES HAD BECOME EMERALD GREEN COLOR, REALLY DARK GREEN, ALSO WITH PAIN BECOMING WORSE. I WAS TOLD TO WRAP HOT WATER BOTTLE IN TOWEL AND PLACE TO MY BREAST; AND I WAS GIVEN PAIN CONTROL DRUGS. I STOOD THE PAIN UNTIL I COULD NO MORE. IN 6/90, I SAW BREAST SURGEON AGAIN, ASKING HIM IF THERE WAS A WAY HE COULD RELIEVE ME FROM TERRIBLE PAIN I WAS IN. I WAS TOLD THAT THERE COULD ONLY BE ONE SOLUTION, AND THAT WAS TO HAVE DOUBLE MASTECTOMY. HE WOULD ONLY DO IT IF I WAS TO HAVE SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. I AGREED. I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE. IN 8/89 I HAD BILATERAL ""MAMMADOCHECTOMY."" THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT EITHER, SO THAT'S WHY I ASKED FOR MASTECTOMY. I SAW BREAST SURGEON WHO REFERRED ME TO PLASTIC SURGEON, AND THE OPERATION WAS A JOINT ONE. THE BREAST WAS REMOVED, AND BREAST TISSUE DOWN TO MUSCLE (SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY); AND IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION WITH SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. THIS WAS CARRIED OUT IN 1990. I HAD BILATERAL SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY DEEP DOWN TO PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE, IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS IN 1990. THE IMPLANTS BECAME EXPOSED DUE TO SCARS GAPING OPEN, FLUID WAS OOZING OUT. SWABS TAKEN OF FLUID REVEALED AFTER CULTURED PLASMA (KLEBSIELLA AEROGENES). I WAS GIVEN IV 500 MG METRONIDAZOLE, TETRACYCLINE/FLUCLOXACILLIN/PAIN KILLERS TYLOX. I HAD BLOOD TRANSFUSION AND THE IMPLANTS REMOVED THE FOLLOWING DAY. I WAS TOLD WHAT HAPPENED WAS JUST A ONE IN A MILLION CHANCE OF EVER HAPPENING, AND THAT I COULD HAVE SECOND ATTEMPT OF BEING REINSERTED WITH THE BREAST IMPLANTS AFTER 8 MOS. I TOOK SURGEON'S OFFER, AND HAD SECOND ATTEMPT OF HAVING SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLANTS. AGAIN IN 1991 I HAD INSERTION OF BREAST IMPLANTS YET AGAIN. IN 1992 I ALSO HAD TO HAVE THEM REMOVED DUE TO SYSTEMIC INFECTION. IN 1997, I CAME ACROSS THE PACKAGE INSERT AND PRODUCT DATA SHEET, CLEARLY STATING THAT MASTITIS OR ANY ACTIVE INFECTION IS CONTRAINDICATED TO THE USE OF BREAST IMPLANTS MADE FROM SILICONE GEL. I AM SO ILL WITH FIBRO-FATTY CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDER, ACCOMPANIED WITH SEVERE PAIN, PROMINENTLY MARKED VASCULARITY, FIBROMYALGIA, CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME, HYPOTHYROIDISM, PLANTAR FASCIITIS, ARTHRITIS IN KNEES, HANDS AND BACK. I EXPERIENCE NOW SEVERE PAIN IN HANDS, FINGERS, ARMS, THIGHS, BUTTOCKS CHEEKS, HIPS, AND CALVES OF BOTH LEGS. I HAVE LOSS OF BALANCE, LOSS OF WORDS, CONCENTRATION PROBLEMS, DRY EYES, MOUTH, NOSE AND VAGINA. I ALSO HAVE A LOT OF INFECTIONS, BREATHING DIFFICULTY, BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS, THRUSH IN MOUTH/VAGINA, CHEST INFECTIONS, THROAT INFECTIONS, EAR INFECTIONS, BOWEL DISORDER, AND BLADDER PROBLEMS. I HAVE WIDESPREAD PAPILLOMAS, CHEST THROUGH ARMS AND NECK. I HAVE FIBROS TISSUE IN MY JOINTS. I ALSO HAVE PAIN IN MY HEAD; IT IS NOT A HEADACHE, IT IS LIKE WHEN INFECTION AND PUSS THROB LIKE PAIN. LOSS OF SLEEP, DROPPING THINGS, BUMPING INTO THINGS, ELECTRIC SHOCK - LIKE WHEN YOU TOUCH BARE WIRES ON ELECTRICAL GOODS, IF I TOUCH ANYTHING METAL. CRAWLING SENSATION IF I TOUCH NYLON, DRYLON, LEATHER OR POLYESTER; IF I USE TALC PERFUMED AND COLORED SOAP. I ALSO HAVE FOOD ALLERGIES. DUE TO HAVING BACTERIAL INFECTIONS I STILL EVEN TODAY TAKE METRONIDAZOLE, ANTIBIOTICS, AND ANTIFUNGAL MEDICATION TOO. I FEEL VERY WEAK, I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING CHRONIC FLU-LIKE SYMPTOMS, BUT I DON'T HAVE THE FLU. I CAN ONLY STAND, EVEN WALK SHORT PACES BEFORE BECOMING EXHAUSTED, AND MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE SEVERE PAIN I SUFFER FROM. I'M IN MY EARLY 40'S, BUT AT THIS MOMENT I FEEL LIKE 90, AND IT ISN'T RIGHT. THE DOCTORS I'M UNDER DON'T KNOW HOW TO BEGIN TO TREAT ME. HOWEVER, THEY KNOW WHAT THE CAUSE IS BUT AT THIS MOMENT CANNOT OFFER ANY KIND OF TREATMENT. I AM A TEST CASE OVER HERE OF THE DOCTORS WHO ARE DEALING WITH ME. LET'S HOPE SOMETHING CAN BE DONE PRETTY SOON. I DO BLAME THE SURGEONS FOR THEIR IGNORANCE AND STUPIDITY OF THE WAY THEY HAVE TREATED ME IN THE FIRST PLACE. TO BEGIN WITH, FOR IGNORING THE PRODUCT DATA SHEETS OF ALL BREAST IMPLANTS, ALONG WITH IGNORING THE PACKAGE INSERTS TOO. I HAVE LOST ALL TRUST AND FAITH IN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. THE GOVERNMENT: FOR REFUSING TO CARRY OUT ANY KIND OF RESEARCH OR TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE LIKE ME WITH THE SAME ILLNESS; THE TREATMENT WE NEED SO DESPERATELY TO GET WELL. I KNOW I'M AS TOUGH AS NAILS. I DON'T INTEND TO SIT BACK AND DO NOTHING. I'M DETERMINED TO GET SOMEWHERE AND GET THE TREATMENT I SO DESPERATELY NEED. UP UNTIL 1989 I USED TO WORK FULL TIME, 16 HRS A DAY IN A CUTLERY FACTORY. I ALSO TOOK CARE OF MY MOM WHO DIED FROM TERMINAL CANCER BACK IN 1985. I ALSO TOOK CARE OF MY FATHER WHO ALSO DIED FROM A TERMINAL DISEASE. BOTH OF MY PARENTS DIED FROM CHEST ILLNESSES, MOST OF MY FATHER'S FAMILY DIED FROM TUBERCULOSIS, LUNG CANCER, HEART ATTACKS, AND STROKES. IN MY MOM'S FAMILY THEY DIED OF LUNG/BREAST CANCER ETHACENIA. THEY ALL WENT TO OPEN AIR SCHOOL. I WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS BORN IN PERFECT HEALTH, THAT IS UNTIL I MARRIED AND HAD CHILDREN AT THE AGE OF 16."" HISTORY: PT SUFFERED FROM CHRONIC BREAST PAIN FOR A PERIOD OF APPROX 20 YEARS AND WHICH WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CYSTIC MASTITIS. VARIOUS CONSERVATIVE, DRUG TREATMENT REGIMES WERE TRIED TO HELP HER WITH THIS PROBLEM BUT TO NO AVAIL. SHE DESCRIBES HAVING A COLORED DISCHARGE COMING FROM HER NIPPLES IN ADDITION TO THE PAIN. SHE CAME UNDER THE CARE OF A CONSULTANT GENERAL SURGEON WHO PERFORMED AN OPERATION ON HER BREAST DUCTS IN 1989.

I HAD NO FURTHER SCANS THAT REVEALED I HAD FIBROCYSTIC MASTITIS; BY THAT TIME FLUID FROM BOTH MY NIPPLES HAD BECOME EMERALD GREEN COLOR, REALLY DARK GREEN, ALSO WITH PAIN BECOMING WORSE. I WAS TOLD TO WRAP HOT WATER BOTTLE IN TOWEL AND PLACE TO MY BREAST; AND I WAS GIVEN PAIN CONTROL DRUGS. I STOOD THE PAIN UNTIL I COULD NO MORE. IN 6/90, I SAW BREAST SURGEON AGAIN, ASKING HIM IF THERE WAS A WAY HE COULD RELIEVE ME FROM TERRIBLE PAIN I WAS IN. I WAS TOLD THAT THERE COULD ONLY BE ONE SOLUTION, AND THAT WAS TO HAVE DOUBLE MASTECTOMY. HE WOULD ONLY DO IT IF I WAS TO HAVE SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. I AGREED. I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE. IN 8/89 I HAD BILATERAL ""MAMMADOCHECTOMY."" THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT EITHER, SO THAT'S WHY I ASKED FOR MASTECTOMY. I SAW BREAST SURGEON WHO REFERRED ME TO PLASTIC SURGEON, AND THE OPERATION WAS A JOINT ONE. THE BREAST WAS REMOVED, AND BREAST TISSUE DOWN TO MUSCLE (SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY); AND IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION WITH SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. THIS WAS CARRIED OUT IN 1990. I HAD BILATERAL SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY DEEP DOWN TO PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE, IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS IN 1990. THE IMPLANTS BECAME EXPOSED DUE TO SCARS GAPING OPEN, FLUID WAS OOZING OUT. SWABS TAKEN OF FLUID REVEALED AFTER CULTURED PLASMA (KLEBSIELLA AEROGENES). I WAS GIVEN IV 500 MG METRONIDAZOLE, TETRACYCLINE/FLUCLOXACILLIN/PAIN KILLERS TYLOX. I HAD BLOOD TRANSFUSION AND THE IMPLANTS REMOVED THE FOLLOWING DAY. I WAS TOLD WHAT HAPPENED WAS JUST A ONE IN A MILLION CHANCE OF EVER HAPPENING, AND THAT I COULD HAVE SECOND ATTEMPT OF BEING REINSERTED WITH THE BREAST IMPLANTS AFTER 8 MOS. I TOOK SURGEON'S OFFER, AND HAD SECOND ATTEMPT OF HAVING SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLANTS. AGAIN IN 1991 I HAD INSERTION OF BREAST IMPLANTS YET AGAIN. IN 1992 I ALSO HAD TO HAVE THEM REMOVED DUE TO SYSTEMIC INFECTION. IN 1997, I CAME ACROSS THE PACKAGE INSERT AND PRODUCT DATA SHEET, CLEARLY STATING THAT MASTITIS OR ANY ACTIVE INFECTION IS CONTRAINDICATED TO THE USE OF BREAST IMPLANTS MADE FROM SILICONE GEL. I AM SO ILL WITH FIBRO-FATTY CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDER, ACCOMPANIED WITH SEVERE PAIN, PROMINENTLY MARKED VASCULARITY, FIBROMYALGIA, CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME, HYPOTHYROIDISM, PLANTAR FASCIITIS, ARTHRITIS IN KNEES, HANDS AND BACK. I EXPERIENCE NOW SEVERE PAIN IN HANDS, FINGERS, ARMS, THIGHS, BUTTOCKS CHEEKS, HIPS, AND CALVES OF BOTH LEGS. I HAVE LOSS OF BALANCE, LOSS OF WORDS, CONCENTRATION PROBLEMS, DRY EYES, MOUTH, NOSE AND VAGINA. I ALSO HAVE A LOT OF INFECTIONS, BREATHING DIFFICULTY, BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS, THRUSH IN MOUTH/VAGINA, CHEST INFECTIONS, THROAT INFECTIONS, EAR INFECTIONS, BOWEL DISORDER, AND BLADDER PROBLEMS. I HAVE WIDESPREAD PAPILLOMAS, CHEST THROUGH ARMS AND NECK. I HAVE FIBROS TISSUE IN MY JOINTS. I ALSO HAVE PAIN IN MY HEAD; IT IS NOT A HEADACHE, IT IS LIKE WHEN INFECTION AND PUSS THROB LIKE PAIN. LOSS OF SLEEP, DROPPING THINGS, BUMPING INTO THINGS, ELECTRIC SHOCK - LIKE WHEN YOU TOUCH BARE WIRES ON ELECTRICAL GOODS, IF I TOUCH ANYTHING METAL. CRAWLING SENSATION IF I TOUCH NYLON, DRYLON, LEATHER OR POLYESTER; IF I USE TALC PERFUMED AND COLORED SOAP. I ALSO HAVE FOOD ALLERGIES. DUE TO HAVING BACTERIAL INFECTIONS I STILL EVEN TODAY TAKE METRONIDAZOLE, ANTIBIOTICS, AND ANTIFUNGAL MEDICATION TOO. I FEEL VERY WEAK, I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING CHRONIC FLU-LIKE SYMPTOMS, BUT I DON'T HAVE THE FLU. I CAN ONLY STAND, EVEN WALK SHORT PACES BEFORE BECOMING EXHAUSTED, AND MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE SEVERE PAIN I SUFFER FROM. I'M IN MY EARLY 40'S, BUT AT THIS MOMENT I FEEL LIKE 90, AND IT ISN'T RIGHT. THE DOCTORS I'M UNDER DON'T KNOW HOW TO BEGIN TO TREAT ME. HOWEVER, THEY KNOW WHAT THE CAUSE IS BUT AT THIS MOMENT CANNOT OFFER ANY KIND OF TREATMENT. I AM A TEST CASE OVER HERE OF THE DOCTORS WHO ARE DEALING WITH ME. LET'S HOPE SOMETHING CAN BE DONE PRETTY SOON. I DO BLAME THE SURGEONS FOR THEIR IGNORANCE AND STUPIDITY OF THE WAY THEY HAVE TREATED ME IN THE FIRST PLACE. TO BEGIN WITH, FOR IGNORING THE PRODUCT DATA SHEETS OF ALL BREAST IMPLANTS, ALONG WITH IGNORING THE PACKAGE INSERTS TOO. I HAVE LOST ALL TRUST AND FAITH IN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. THE GOVERNMENT: FOR REFUSING TO CARRY OUT ANY KIND OF RESEARCH OR TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE LIKE ME WITH THE SAME ILLNESS; THE TREATMENT WE NEED SO DESPERATELY TO GET WELL. I KNOW I'M AS TOUGH AS NAILS. I DON'T INTEND TO SIT BACK AND DO NOTHING. I'M DETERMINED TO GET SOMEWHERE AND GET THE TREATMENT I SO DESPERATELY NEED. UP UNTIL 1989 I USED TO WORK FULL TIME, 16 HRS A DAY IN A CUTLERY FACTORY. I ALSO TOOK CARE OF MY MOM WHO DIED FROM TERMINAL CANCER BACK IN 1985. I ALSO TOOK CARE OF MY FATHER WHO ALSO DIED FROM A TERMINAL DISEASE. BOTH OF MY PARENTS DIED FROM CHEST ILLNESSES, MOST OF MY FATHER'S FAMILY DIED FROM TUBERCULOSIS, LUNG CANCER, HEART ATTACKS, AND STROKES. IN MY MOM'S FAMILY THEY DIED OF LUNG/BREAST CANCER ETHACENIA. THEY ALL WENT TO OPEN AIR SCHOOL. I WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS BORN IN PERFECT HEALTH, THAT IS UNTIL I MARRIED AND HAD CHILDREN AT THE AGE OF 16."" HISTORY: PT SUFFERED FROM CHRONIC BREAST PAIN FOR A PERIOD OF APPROX 20 YEARS AND WHICH WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CYSTIC MASTITIS. VARIOUS CONSERVATIVE, DRUG TREATMENT REGIMES WERE TRIED TO HELP HER WITH THIS PROBLEM BUT TO NO AVAIL. SHE DESCRIBES HAVING A COLORED DISCHARGE COMING FROM HER NIPPLES IN ADDITION TO THE PAIN. SHE CAME UNDER THE CARE OF A CONSULTANT GENERAL SURGEON WHO PERFORMED AN OPERATION ON HER BREAST DUCTS IN 1989.

280331|191820|D|1||"I HAD COMPLICATIONS IMMEDIATELY. I HAD TO HAVE 2 ADD'L SURGERIES TO CORRECT THE COMPLICATIONS. THEY HARDENED, MOVED IN MY CHEST CAVITY, AND THEY LEAKED. I STARTED TO ITCH IMMEDIATELY, AND BECAME ALLERGIC TO MANY THINGS. MY BODY FELT FATIGUED, I HAD MIGRAINE HEADACHES, AND COULDN'T SLEEP. I BEGAN TO ACHE ALL OVER, HAD PANIC ATTACKS, MY VISION CHANGED RAPIDLY. I KEPT REPORTING VARIOUS COMPLAINTS TO MY PHYSICIANS, NO ONE COULD HELP ME, EVEN THOUGH THEY KEPT TRYING. I BECAME DEPRESSED, MY WHOLE BODY BEGAN TO CHANGE, MY BREASTS WERE ITCHING DEEP INSIDE, WERE COMPLETELY NUMB. THEY WERE HOT TO TOUCH, AND PAINFUL, I WAS TOLD IT WOULD GO AWAY. THE SYMPTOMS PROGRESSED RAPIDLY, EACH TIME THEY WENT BACK IN, THEY USED THE SAME IMPLANTS, EVEN REFILLED THE ONE THAT LEAKED. MY MAMMOGRAMS SHOWED A BULGE, THE RADIOLOGIST ADVISED ME TO REMOVE THEM, THE PLASTIC SURGEON DENIED WHAT THE FILM SHOWED. I HAD A SONOGRAM LATER, AND IT SHOWED MY LYMPH NODES WERE SWOLLEN. THEY IDENTIFIED GEL OUTSIDE OF THE CAPSULES. MY HEALTH WAS DECLINING RAPIDLY. THE NURSES TOLD ME ABOUT THE ADVERSE EFFECTS, TWO MONTHS BEFORE THIS LITIGATION WAS TO CLOSE. I HAD TO SEE AN INTERNAL SPECIALIST, WHO DIAGNOSED ME WITH SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS, SO DID A RHEUMATOLOGIST, AND SO DID A NEUROLOGIST. I HAVE SEIZURES, CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDER, ATYPICAL LUPUS, SJOGREN'S, RAYNAUD'S, NUMEROUS OTHER CONDITIONS. I HAVE BEEN HOSPITALIZED, GONE TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM, STAYED HOME BECAUSE I AM NOW UNEMPLOYABLE. NO ONE WILL INSURE ME NOW, AND THIS IS A PARTIAL LIST OF MY SYMPTOMS, AND DISORDERS. I AM POSITIVE MY PATHOLOGIST'S REPORT SHOWED A HOLE IN MY IMPLANT. MY VISION IS VERY IMPAIRED NOW. I CAN'T GET OUT OF BED, WITHOUT HELP, AND I AM CONSTANTLY ILL. I AM IN HORRENDOUS PAIN EACH DAY. MY MEMORY IS IMPAIRED SIGNIFICANTLY. I GET LOST, I CAN'T EVEN SHOP FOR GROCERIES, OR COOK A MEAL NOW. I DON'T GO INTO A DEEP SLEEP PATTERN, MY BRAIN STAYS ON RUN, WHILE MY BODY CRIES IN PAIN. MY LEGS AND FEET STAY SWOLLEN HUGE. MY FINGERS DON'T MOVE, I HAVE CRAMPS IN MY HANDS, LEGS, AND FEET THAT MAKE MY HANDS DRAW INTO GNARLS. I HAVE NIGHT SWEATS, MY FACE IS GETTING A PINK RASH OVER MY NOSE. MY BRAIN HAS ELECTRIC LIGHT SHOWS, AND I WAKE UP EXHAUSTED. MY WHOLE LIFE HAS CHANGED. MY IMMUNE SYSTEM IS COMPROMISED, I CAN'T BE AROUND ANYONE WHO IS ILL, OR I GET ILL. I'M SO ALLERGIC TO ALL CHEMICALS, I HAVE SEVERE REACTIONS TO THEM. MY VOICE HAS CHANGED, MY SPEECH IS SLURRED, I'M NOT ME NOW. MY FACE HAS BROKEN OUT IN BLISTERS, I'M ALLERGIC TO THE SUN, AND I HAVE ASTHMA NOW. I CAN'T BEGIN TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAS HAPPENED. I HAVE SOMEONE TYPING FOR ME, MY BRAIN CAN'T PUT THE WORDS TOGETHER NOW. I HAD NONE OF THESE PROBLEMS BEFORE IMPLANTS. I WAS NEVER TOLD OF THE CHEMICALS IN IMPLANTS. I WAS TOLD THAT IT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER TO DETECT BREAST CANCER. I HAD FIBRO-CYSTIC BREAST DISEASE. I AM POSITIVE THE IMPLANTS ARE WHAT HAS CAUSED ME TO BECOME EXTREMELY DISABLED, I AM FORCED TO FILE FOR DISABILITY. I WOULD RATHER BE THE PRODUCTIVE PERSON I WAS BEFORE I HAD SILICONE IMPLANTS. I RARELY AM ABLE TO GO OUT. I CAN'T HOLD MY GRANDBABIES OR PARTICIPATE IN A NORMAL LIFE. I AM SEXUALLY NOT A LADY NOW. I CAN'T HAVE A CLIMAX, MY VAGINA IS SO DRY, AND PAINFUL. WHY DID THE FDA ALLOW THIS? I THOUGHT IMPLANTS WERE SAFE, AND HAD BEEN APPROVED. NOW I'M READING I'VE BEEN TOXICALLY POISONED. I TRY TO USE MY MIND TO CONTROL PAIN. I AM ILL, I WANT TO BE WELL, I WANT TO BE FREE FROM ALL OF THE THINGS I HAVE WRONG WITH ME NOW. I TRY SO HARD, BUT I CAN'T DO THINGS. I WILL NEVER GIVE UP TRYING. I WISH I WAS WELL ENOUGH TO BE ME AGAIN NOW. I STAY AWAY FROM THE DOCTORS, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY MORE. I CAN'T HEAR WELL, AND I'M SO TIRED. I DON'T LEAD A NORMAL LIFE. I'M SICK, AND I'M JUST TRYING TO HIDE FROM ANY MORE TESTS, OR HOSPS. THESE CHEST PAINS WERE NEVER NORMAL FOR A 35 YEAR OLD LADY WHO EXERCIZED, WAS PHYSICALLY IN SHAPE. NOW I CAN'T RAISE MY ARMS, THE PAIN GOES FROM MY BREAST CLEAR DOWN TO MY FINGERTIPS. I CAN'T TELL YOU ANY MORE, IT'S TOO UPSETTING TO LOOK AT. I HAD A HYSTERECTOMY, I HEMORRHAGED FOR MONTHS. I'VE HAD A KIDNEY STONE, MY BLADDER IS BLOCKED, INFECTED ALL THE TIME, AND THEY CAN'T DO SURGERY. I HAVE A YEAST INFECTION CONTINUALLY. MY NAILS HAVE HAD A FUNGUS. MY SKIN HAS HUGE BLOOD PLACES THE SIZE OF A MAN'S HAND, ON MY FOREARMS ALWAYS, MY SKIN IS LIKE TISSUE PAPER. I FREEZE WHEN IT IS 90 DEGREES. SINUS, OH I COULD JUST KEEP GOING ON, AND ON BUT I WON'T. I THINK YOU HAVE READ ENOUGH. I'M BACK IN KINDERGARTEN, AND I WAS INTELLIGENT ONCE.

487721|302479|D|1||"PT WAS RAISED ON A RANCH AND PT OWNED A RANCH MOST OF THEIR ADULT LIFE. PT WAS A VERY HARD WORKER AND PT WAS HARDLY SICK A DAY IN THEIR LIFE. IN 1990 PT HAD REMARRIED AND THOUGHT THEY NEEDED TO LOOK YOUNGER, SO THEY OPTED TO GET SILICONE BREAST IMPALNTS. PT HAD TALKED TO A PLASTIC SURGEON AND HE TOLD THEM THEY WERE SAFE AND THEY WOULD LAST PT'S LIFETIME. HE TOLD THEM THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD RUPTURE THEM WOULD BE A CAR WRECK OR SOME OTHER HARD BLOW. SO, IN 1990 PT HAD MCGHAN SILICONE IMPLANTS IMPLANTED. PT HAD BEEN WORKING IN CLOTHING FACTORY FOR THREE YEARS AT THE TIME PT GOT THE SILICONE IMPLANTS. PT LOVED THEIR JOB AND HAD NEVER MISSED A DAY OF WORK DUE TO ILLNESS. WITHIN FOUR MONTHS OF GETTING THE IMPLANTS PT NOTICED THEY WERE ACHING ALL OVER AND HAD DEVELOPED HEADACHES. THEY WENT BACK TO THE SURGEON WHO THEY HAD GOTTEN THE IMPLANTS FROM AND TOLD HIM THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE MAKING PT SICK. HE TOLD PT THEY WERE LISTENING TOO MUCH TO THE MEDIA AND HE SAW NO REASON TO REMOVE THEM. HE SAID HE SERIOUSLY DOUBTED THE IMPLANTS HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH PT'S ILLNESS. HE TOLD PT THEY HAD MORE RISK FROM GETTING AN INFECTION FROM THE EXPLANTATION THAN THE IMPLANTS HARMING PT. PT BELIEVED HIM AND LEFT THEM IN. PT BECAME MORE ILL AND THE HEADACHES BECAME ALMOST UNBEARABLE. PT MISSED WORK WEEKLY. PT STARTED HAVING SUCH BACK PAIN WITH THE HEADACHES THAT THEY HAD TO QUIT THEIR JOB. IN THE NEXT YEAR PT HAD TO HAVE BACK SURGERY. PT HAD BECOME SO ILL THAT THEY WERE PUT ON SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY. IN THE MID NINETIES PT'S NASAL PASSAGES STARTED BURNING AND THEIR NOSE WAS SWELLING SHUT, IN ADDITION TO THE HORRIBLE HEADACHES. BY THEN THE HEADACHES WERE SO BAD THAT PT HAD TO GO TO ER WITH THEM. THEIR GP SENT PT TO A NEUROLOGIST WHO DID MANY TESTS AND SENT PT TO AN ENT. PT ENDED UP GOING TO THREE ENTS AND HAVING THREE SINUS SURGERIES. THEY ALL TOLD PT THAT SOMETHING WAS INFLAMING THEIR NASAL PASSAGES. THEY TOLD PT THAT IF PT DIDN'T FIND OUT WHAT THEIR BODY WAS REACTING TO, THEY COULDN'T HELP PT. PT WENT TO AN ALLERGIST AND HE FOUND NO ALLERGIES. PT TOLD THEIR SPOUSE MANY TIMES THAT THEY FELT LIKE THEY WERE BEING POISONED. PT HAD THE HOUSE CHECKED FOR ANY TOXINS. SPOUSE CHECKED THE VEHICLES. BY NOW, THEY WERE FEELING MUCH WORSE. THEY FELT DIZZY AND NAUSEATED OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, PT WENT TO MANY DRS. PT WENT TO OTHER FACILITY AND THEY TOLD PT THEIR ILLNESS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THEIR IMPLANTS. PT WENT TO ANOTHER FACILITY AND THEY BOTH TOLD PT THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THEM. PT FOUND ALL THE DRS THAT THEY WENT TO, HEDGING AROUND THE SILICONE SUBJECT. IT WAS LIKE THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. SO THEY JUST SENT PT ON THEIR WAY. PT WAS BECOMING SO VERY FRUSTRATED AND ALONE. THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS PT BECAME SO ILL THEY ARE ALMOST BEDRIDDEN. THEIR NASAL PASSAGES BURN ALL THE TIME AND THEIR HEADACHES ARE CONSTANT. PT CAN HARDLY WALK AS THEIR LEGS AND FEET SWELL AND THEY ACHE ALL OVER. PT IS DIZZY AND NAUSEATED. PT HAS LOST MUCH OF THEIR SHORT-TERM MEMORY. PT HAS DEVELOPED AN IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT. PT FEELS ELECTRIC JOLTS SHOOTING THROUGH THEIR BRAIN. SOME TIMES THEY FEEL LIKE THEY WILL PASS OUT. THEY SWEAT SO BADLY DAY AND NIGHT THAT THEY HAVE TO CHANGE BEDDING AND CLOTHES CONSTANTLY. OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THEY HAVE BECOME INTOLERANT OF MOST CHEMICALS. THEY CAN'T CONSUME OR BREATH ANY CHEMICAL WITHOUT BECOMING EXTREMELY ILL. IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR, THEY FINALLY DECIDED THEY WERE GOING TO DIE IF THEY DIDN'T DO SOMETHING. THE DRS WERE NOT ABLE TO HELP PT. THEY EITHER WEREN'T ABLE TO OR WERE UNWILLING, DUE TO THEIR LACK OF THE PROPER FACTS. DUE TO THE CHEMICAL REACTION, PT DECIDED ON THEIR OWN THAT IT WAS THE SILICONE. PT DOSEN'T CARE HOW MANY DRS TOLD THEM IT WASN'T THE SILICONE. PT KNOWS IT IS. IN AUGUST OF THIS YEAR PT WENT TO A VERY GOOD PLASTIC SURGEON AND SHE TOOK THE IMPLANTS OUT. SHE FOUND THE LEFT IMPANT RUPTURED. SHE SAID THERE WAS VERY LITTLE SILICONE ACTUALLY LEFT IN THE CASE. THE SILICONE HAD MIGRATED DOWN INTO PT'S CHEST AND INTO PT'S LYMPH NODES. THEY DESCRIBED IT AS ""A STICKY MESS"". SHE ALSO REMOVED THE LYMPH NODES WITH SILICONE IN THEM. AT THAT TIME SHE TOLD PT ""THERE WAS PROBABLY SILICONE IN THEIR LIVER, LUNGS AND BRAIN"". THE RIGHT IMPLANT WAS INTACT. PT HAS NO IDEA HOW LONG THE LEFT IMPLANT HAD BEEN RUPTURED. SINCE PT IS DISABLED AND ON MEDICARE, PT HAD TO PAY FOR THE EXPLANTATION. SPOUSE HAD TO TAKE OFF FROM WORK TO TAKE PT AND THEY LOST 10 DAYS OF WORK. IT COSTS THEM $15,000 FOR THE SURGERY, GAS, MOTELS AND LOSS OF SPOUSE'S WAGES. FAMILY USED THEIR SAVING TO PAY FOR THE SURGERY AND TRIP EXPENSES. PT FEELS THEY HAVE LOST THE LAST 13 YEARS OF THEIR LIFE. IF THE DR HAD NOT TOLD PT THEIR ILLNESS WAS NOT CAUSED BY THE SILICONE IMPLANTS, PT WOULD HAVE HAD THEM OUT MANY YEARS AGO AND COULD HAVE SAVED MUCH MORE OF THEIR HEALTH. IT TAKES MANY YEARS TO TEST TO SEE IF A PRODUCT IS SAFE. PT FEELS MANY OF US HAVE BEEN THE GUINEA PIGS. AND PT FEELS IT IS PROVEN THAT SILICONE IS NOT SAFE. IT'S TOO LATE TO DO MUCH FOR PEOPLE LIKE PT, BUT LET'S PLEASE SAVE THE NEXT GENERATION. THERE ARE SO MANY WOMEN OUT HERE SUFFERING IN SILENCE AND FEELING LOST, HELPLESS AND BETRAYED. PLEASE DO ANYTHING YOU CAN TO STOP THE PEOPLE FROM BRINGING THEIR PRESCRIPTIONS BACK FROM CANADA BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID THE DRUGS WEREN'T SAFE. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE CLAIMING TO BE ILL FROM THAT? PT FEELS NO ONE SEEMS TO CARE THAT SILICONE IS POISONING WOMEN BY THE THOUSANDS."|MCGHAN|*|09/13/2003|V|||Y||476585.0|0HP|FTR|1.0||SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS|Y|CY6259|*||*|*|MCGHAN|||||*|NO. 25-45361|True
492398|302950|D|1||"IN 2000 PT WAS VERY MUCH SOLD BY THEIR PLASTIC SURGEON, THE IDEA OF SILICONE FILLED BREAST IMPLANTS. PT WAS VERY LEARY WHEN HE SUGGESTED THE MCGHAN MEDICAL CORP SILICONE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT ADJUNCT STUDY. PT WAS NOT REALLY AWARE THAT PT WAS SIGNING UP TO BE INVOLVED IN A STUDY, PT JUST THOUGHT THEY WERE SINGING A CONSENT TO THE IMPLANTS. THE DR ASSURED PT THEY WERE VERY SAFE IN HIS OWN WORKS ""SO SAFE HE WOULD USE THEM IN MY OWN MOTHER"". HE TOLD PT THE SILICONE WOULD BE MORE NATURAL-THEY ARE IN NO WAY NATURAL-. ON THE CONSENT PT WAS GIVEN IT STATES THAT IN ORDER TO BE IN THE STUDY YOU MUST HAVE CONDITION APPROPRIATE FOR BREAST RECONSTRUCTION IN WHICH SALINE-FILLED IMPLANTS ARE NOT SUITABLE. THIS IS NOT TRUE. THERE WAS NO REASON EXCEPT THE DR'S PERSUASION THAT PT NEEDED SILICONE. PT ASKS IF THESE DRS GET MONEY TO RECRUIT STUDY MEMBERS. AT ANY RATE IT HAS NOT BEEN THREE YEARS YET AND PT IS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH NOT ONE, BUT BOTH IMPLANTS.  PT IS IN A STUDY WHERE NO ONE HAS EVER CALLED PT TO FOLLOW UP ON THE IMPLANTS. PT CANNOT GET A RETURN PHONE CALL FROM THE SURGEON OR THE MANUFACTURER. ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO PT STARTED HAVING BLURRED VISION, DIZZINESS, MEMORY PROBLEMS, FATIGUE, HEAD ACHES. PT HAS ALWAYS BEEN ACTIVE AND NOTHING HAS EVER HELD THEM BACK, THIS STOPPED PT IN THEIR TRACKS. PT HAS BEEN HOSPITALIZED AND POKED AND PRODDED TO FIND OUT WHAT IS WRONG WITH THEM. THE ONLY THING THAT HAS BEEN FOUND IS THAT NOT ONE BUT BOTH SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS RUPTURED. PT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO WORK SINCE MAY, PT HAS LOST ALL HEALTH INSURANCE. PT CANNOT GET ANYONE TO SEE THEM WITH NO MONEY. PT WILL NOW SLOWLY DIE AND STARVE, LOOSE THEIR HOME ETC, ETC. ALL DUE TO THE SILICONE POISONING IN THEIR BODY. PLEASE DO NOT MAKE A PRODUCT LEGAL THAT CAN RUPTURE IN LESS THAN 3 YEARS. PT FEELS THERE MUST BE SOMETHING WRONG WITH A STUDY THAT DOES NOT FOLLOW UP ON THEIR PRIDUCTS. PT ASKS WHERE THEY ARE GETTING THEIR STUDY ANALYSIS. PT FEELS THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING WRONG WITH A PRODUCT THAT RUPTURES IN LESS THAN 3 YEARS. PT DOESN'T KNOW WHERE TO GO OR WHO TO TURN TO. MOST DAYS PT IS TOO ILL TO FIGHT.

692338|477840|D|1||"I WAS A VIBRANT AND OVERLY ENERGETIC WOMAN PRIOR TO THIS MYSTERIOUS ILLNESS WHICH STARTED IN 2001. I NOW FEEL 75. 1999: GOT MCGHAN SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS. 2001: WENT TO HOSP WITH PAIN OVER LEFT BREASTBONE. NOT CRUSHING, JUST A DULL, DEEP ACHE. THEY SAID GERD. I DON'T THINK SO. IN 2001, I WENT TO DR 2 MORE TIMES REGARDING THIS PAIN. X-RAYS NORMAL. HOSPITALIZED BUT FIND NOTHING. JUNE 2002: JOINT PAIN IN KNEES, ELBOWS AND WRISTS, BOTH SIDE OF BODY. NO ASSOCIATED SWELLING, HEAT OR REDNESS; JUST PAIN. MY DR IS BAFFLED. A FEW MONTHS AFTER THAT, I BEGAN WAKING IN THE MORNING FEELING LIKE I HAD BEEN HIT BY A TRUCK. MUSCLES AND JOINTS FEELING OVERWHELMINGLY FATIGUED. DEVELOPED LEFT SIDE FRONT RIB PAIN. LOWERMOST LEFT RIB OR UNDERNEATH IT. COMES AND GOES. X-RAYS SHOW NOTHING THERE. 11/2002: FEELING A RANDOM ""BURNING"" SENSATION IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF BODY LIKE THE FRONT THROAT PART OF MY NECK. FEELS LIKE A ""NICKEL SIZE"" BURNING PAIN; KIND OF FOCUSES LIKE A LASER RATHER THAN A HEAT LAMP FEELING WHICH IS MORE SPREAD OUT. SOMETIMES IT'S IN MY ELBOW, SOMETIMES IN MY CHEST OR MY FINGER. DOESN'T LAST MORE THAN 10 OR 15 MINUTES BUT MOVES AROUND. ACTUALLY, IT FEELS LIKE MY VEINS ARE ON FIRE. 05/2005: YEARLY PHYSICAL. COMPLAINED OF JOINT PAIN AND SHOWED MY PRIMARY PHYSICIAN. A ROUGH PATCH OF RED, ITCHY SKIN BETWEEN ELBOW AND WRIST THAT TURNS INTO WHITE FLAKINESS. ALSO HAD IT ON MY SHIN. UNITL THEN, I HAD NEVER HAND ANY KIND OF RASH. JOINT PAIN IS BIGGEST CONCERN. SHE TESTS FOR ARTHRITIS AND LUPUS. NEGATIVE. SED RATE NORMAL. ANA NORMAL. PAP NORMAL. BLOOD COUNT NORMAL. RHEUMATOID FACTOR NORMAL. TRIGYLCERIDES, THYROID NORMAL. BUT CHOLESTEROL LEVEL WAS SLIGHTLY HIGH. HDL 58. LDL 156. BLOOD SUGAR 82. METABOLIC PATTER NORMAL. AUGUST 2003: HAVING MINI-FEVERS IN THE AFTERNOONS. ACTUAL THERMOMETER WOULD READ 98.9 OR 99.3. MALAISE IN THE AFTERNOONS CONTINUED 3 OR 4 DAYS A WEEK FOR ABOUT 6-8 MOS. ONLY HAPPENS TWICE A MONTH OR SO NOW. LATTER PART OF 2003 TO MID 2004: JOINT PAIN CONTINUES AND INCREASES. I CANNOT FUNCTION ANYMORE AT WORK. HOARSENESS IN VOICE. HAD TO CLEAR MY THROAT CONSTANTLY FOR 5 OR 6 MONTHS. THEN AS QUICKLY AS IT CAME, IT WENT AWAY. NEW SYMPTOM. MY EYES FEEL LIKE THEY'RE INFECTED. SANDY, GRITTY. HURT FOR 2 MOS WITHOUT VISINE. OPHTHALMOGIST TELLS ME DRY-EYE SYNDROME BECAUSE I FAILED THE SCHRIMER TISSUE TEST. HE INSERTS PUNCTUAL PLUGS INTO MY TEARDUCTS AND THAT DOES THE TRICK. I'VE FELT FINE EVER SINCE EXCEPT THAT SOMEITMES TEARS WILL RUN DOWN MY FACE. IN THE MEANTIME, I AM WAKING 1 OR 2 DAYS PER WEEK WITH MY TONGUE STUCK TO THE ROOF OF MY MOUTH. I TOOK THIS UP ON THE INTERNET. SJOGREN'S MAYBE? NOW I AM BEGINNING TO HAVE A HUGE PAIN IN MY BIG TOE. YET ANOTHER RANDOM PAIN. ALSO, I AM WAKING UP WITH NUMB HANDS. 07/2004: DEEP BURNING PAIN STARTS IN MY RIGHT CALF. WITHIN WEEKS PROGRESSES TO A STRANGE BURNING, TINGLING FROM BELOW MY KNEES ALL THE WAY TO MY FEET. GETS WAY WORSE AT NIGHT. REALLY HURTS. SLEEP IS INTERRUPTED. 09/2004: BURNING PAIN AND TINGLING -LIKE ASLEEP- IS NOT GOING AWAY. NOW I HAVE IT IN BOTH LEGS FROM MY KNEES TO FEET AND SOMETIMES IN BOTH ARMS FROM MY ELBOWS TO MY HANDS. JOINT PAIN CONTINUES BUT DOESN'T SEEM AS BAD AS IT USED TO- EMPHASIS NOW IS ON THE BURNING LEGS AND HANDS. TYLENOL, MOTRIN AND ADVIL DON'T WORK. NEITHER DOES CAPZACIN CREAM OR HOT BATHS. ONE TIME MY FEET FELT LIKE THEY WERE ON FIRE SO BADLY, I HAD TO STICK THEM IN ICE TO SLEEP. SMALL RELIEF. 11/2004: NEUROLOGIST DOES AN EXAM AND A NERVE TEST WITH ELECTRODES. HE SAYS THE TESTS SHOWED ABNORMALITY AND DIAGNOSES ""NEURITIS"" HE GIVES ME ELAVIL AND NEURONTIN. HE KIDS ME AND SAYS POISONING CAN CREATE THESE SYMPTOMS. EITHER WAY, HE THINKS IT'S SOME TYPE OF SYNDROME THAT HASN'T COMPLETELY SHOWN UP. ITCHY, SCALY WHITISH PATCHY RASH IS BACK. THIS TIME ON RIGHT ANKLE AND ON LEFT PALM OF HAND NEAR THUMB. 01/2005: OUT OF THE BLUE I DEVELOP A HORRIBLE BLADDER/KIDNEY INFECTION. URINE SMELLS LIKE BURNT RUBBER OR BURNT HAIR AND IS DARK WITH BLOOD. I'M BEGINNING TO HAVE ABDOMINAL PAIN SO I GO TO DR. SHE SPENDS TIME GOING OVER ALL OF MY SYMPTOMS AND TELLS ME SHE THINKS I NEED TO HAVE MY IMPLANTS REMOVED. LEFT SIDE LOWERMOST RIB PAIN CONTINUES SPORADICALLY. I'LL HAVE IT FOR 2 DAYS, IT'LL DISAPEAR FOR 10 AND THEN IT COMES BACK FOR A DAY AND DISAPPEARS. IT DOESN'T HURT TO PRESS ON IT. I HAVE HAD X-RAYS. NOTHING. SOMETIMES WHEN I WAKE UP I HAVE TO FEEL MY HANDS IN THE DARK TO MAKE SURE MY FINGERS ARE STILL THERE. MY FIRST 4 FINGERS ARE COMPLETELY NUMB ON BOTH HANDS. LITTLE FINGER IS NOT. MY B12 WAS TESTED 6 MONTHS AGO BUT I HAD TAKEN A B12 VITAMIN A FEW HRS BEFORE. STILL, THE TEST WAS NORMAL. MY LYMPH NODES ARE NEVER SWOLLEN AND I DON'T HAVE HEADACHES. I NEVER HAVE REDNESS OR SWELLING OVER AFFECTED JOINTS. BURNING AND TINGLING REMAINS EVEN THOUGH I AM TAKING MY NEURONTIN. IN 07/2005, I SEE A SPECIALIST AND A RHENUMATOLOGIST. HE DIAGNOSES AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE CALLED SJOGREN'S SYNDROME. HE PUTS ME ON 1200 MG PER DAY OF NEURONTIN, 400 MG PER DAY OF PLAQUENIL, VITAMIN B6. AMBIEN TO GET TO SLEEP, TRAZADONE TO KEEP ME ASLEEP. NOW I AM ON ANTI-ANXIETY MEDICINE AS WELL. 3 WEEKS AGO MY GP SENT ME TO A DERMATOLOGIST WHO BIOPSIED MY RASHES AND SAYS I AM HAVING AN INTERNAL ALLERGIC REACITON. I THINK THIS POINTS TO THE IMPLANTS AGAIN.

IN FEB 1992, THEY WERE WITHDRAWN FROM THE MARKET AND I WAS SENT LITERATURE TELLING ME THAT I COULD GET BAD DISEASES FROM THEM, LIKE FIBROMYALGIA AND LUPUS. I DIDN'T HAVE THE CASH OR THE TIME TO TAKE OFF WORK TO GET THEM REMOVED SO I TRIED TO LIVE WITH THEM. TWO BACK SURGERIES LATER, I GOT A STAPH INFECTION IN MY SPINE WHILE AT HOSP IN 2001. I NEVER GOT BETTER, JUST SICKER AND MORE PAIN. A RHEUMATOLOGIST DIAGNOSED ME WITH FIBROMYALGIA IN NOVEMBER 2005. I HAD THE IMPLANTS REMOVED IN 2007 AND THE DOCTOR SAID THEY WERE COVERED WITH MOLD AND ALSO MY CHEST CAVITY. HE DID NOT DO A PATHOLOGY REPORT AS WE HAD DISCUSSED DURING A PRE-OP APPOINTMENT IF HE FOUND SOMETHING UNUSUAL. HE TOLD ME HE HAS ONLY SEEN 4 CASES LIKE MINE. MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN IS TRYING TO FIND ME AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE SPECIALIST TO HELP RID MY BODY OF THESE LIFE-THREATENING TOXINS. I AM SCIENTIC PROOF THAT BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT SAFE.

2112878|2143713|D|1||ALCL CASE REPORT. (B)(6) FEMALE, (B)(6). ALCL DIAGNOSIS: DATE OF DIAGNOSIS - (B)(6) 2011, ANATOMIC SITE OF ALCL: LEFT BREAST IMPLANT CAPSULE PRIMARY SITE, CONFIRMED BY PATHOLOGY. INITIAL CLINICAL PRESENTATION (B)(6) 2010. THIS IS (B)(6) FEMALE WITH A HISTORY OF DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU OF THE LEFT BREAST DIAGNOSED IN 1998. SHE SUBSEQUENTLY UNDERWENT A LEFT MASTECTOMY WHERE THE SPECIMEN WEIGHT WAS 596 GRAMS. SHE UNDERWENT IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION WITH PLACEMENT OF SUBMUSCULAR TISSUE EXPANDER BY PLASTIC SURGEON #1. THE TISSUE EXPANDER WAS PLACED COMPLETELY SUBPECTORAL AND ALSO IN A SUBSERRATUS POCKET. THE EXPANDER WAS REMOVED IN 1999 AND REPLACED WITH A MCGHAN 440 ML DUAL-CHAMBER SILICONE AND SALINE-FILLED IMPLANT. SHE RECEIVED NO POSTOPERATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY OR RADIATION THERAPY. WITHIN A YEAR, SHE DEVELOPED SIGNIFICANT HARDENING AND DISTORTION OF THE LEFT RECONSTRUCTED BREAST WITH GRADUAL ELEVATION OF THE IMPLANT, TIGHTENING OF THE TISSUE AROUND THE IMPLANT, AND DISCOMFORT IN THE LEFT CHEST WALL. SHE WAS SEEN IN EVALUATION IN 2006 BY PLASTIC SURGEON #2, WHO RE-OPERATED ON HER LEFT BREAST AND REMOVED THE EXISTING IMPLANT, PERFORMED PERIPROSTHETIC CAPSULOTOMIES WHICH WERE NOT SPECIFIED IN THE OPERATIVE NOTE, SUBMITTED CAPSULAR TISSUE FOR HISTOLOGIC EXAMINATION (INTERPRETED AS NEGATIVE) AND REPLACED A SMALLER SALINE IMPLANT. THIS WAS AN ALLERGAN-STYLE 68MP SALINE IMPLANT, SIZE 390-420 ML. THIS RECONSTRUCTION WAS SOFT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, BUT WITHIN 1 YEAR, SHE HAD RECURRENCE OF THE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE WITH TIGHTENING OF THE TISSUE AROUND THE IMPLANT, GRADUAL ELEVATION OF THE IMPLANT LOCATION, AND DISCOMFORT IN THE LEFT CHEST WALL. SHE WAS SEEN IN EVALUATION IN 2009 BY PLASTIC SURGEON #4 WHO RECOMMENDED THAT SHE CONSIDER REVISION OF HER RECONSTRUCTION WITH THE ADDITION OF AN CELLULAR DERMAL MATRIX TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR RECURRENCE OF HER CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE AROUND THE DEVICE. PLASTIC SURGEON #4 ALSO RECOMMENDED AUTOLOGOUS ABDOMINAL FLAP RECONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES. THE PT WAS INTERESTED IN CONSIDERING A DIEP FLAP AND PLASTIC SURGEON #4 REFERRED HER TO ME ((B)(6) SURGEON #5) FOR EVALUATION AND CONSIDERATION OF A FREE FLAP BREAST RECONSTRUCTION PROCEDURE. THE PT'S PAST MEDICAL HISTORY WAS ADDITIONALLY SIGNIFICANT FOR A HISTORY OF HYPOTHYROIDISM AND BLADDER PROLAPSE. HER MEDICATIONS INCLUDED SYNTHROID 88 MCG DAILY, VITAMIN D, AND ADVIL. SHE IS A NONSMOKER AND DRINKS ALCOHOL RARELY. INITIAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION, (B)(6) 2010, SHOWED THE PT WAS 155 CM TALL, 70.3 KG. THE LEFT BREAST WAS ABSENT THROUGH A TRANSVERSE STEWART-TYPE MASTECTOMY INCISION. THERE WAS AN IMPLANT PRESENT IN THE SUBPECTORAL POSITION ON THE LEFT SIDE. THERE WAS A BAKER GRADE IV CAPSULE CONTRACTURE AROUND THIS DEVICE, WHICH WAS RIGIDLY AFFIXED TO HER CHEST WALL AND SOMEWHAT TENDER TO MANIPULATION. THE WOUNDS WERE WELL HEALED WITH NO EVIDENCE OF SCAR HYPERTROPHY. THE RIGHT BREAST WAS MORE PTOTIC WITH A DEGREE OF PSEUDOPTOSIS, LATERAL BOTTOMING OUT AND A WISE-PATTERN SCAR FROM PREVIOUS MASTOPEXY - RESULTING IN SUBSTANTIAL SHAPE AND VOLUME ASYMMETRY. ON THE LEFT SIDE, THE STERNAL NOTCH TO INFRAMAMMARY FOLD DISTANCE WAS 20 CM. ON THE RIGHT SIDE, THE STERNAL NOTCH TO INFRAMAMMARY FOLD DISTANCE WAS 23 CM. THE MID-CLAVICULAR POINT TO NIPPLE DISTANCE ON THE RIGHT WAS 21 CM. EXAMINATION OF THE ABDOMEN SHOWED A GENEROUS AMOUNT OF TISSUE IN THE LOWER 1/3 OF THE ABDOMEN FOR ABDOMINAL FLAP CONSIDERATION. INITIAL IMPRESSION, (B)(6) 2010. THIS WAS A (B)(6) FEMALE WITH RECURRENT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE FOLLOWING 2 PREVIOUS IMPLANT-BASED RECONSTRUCTION SURGERIES ON THE LEFT SIDE. THE LEFT BREAST RECONSTRUCTION SHOWED ELEVATION OF THE INFRAMAMMARY FOLD AND A SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE AROUND THE EXISTING IMPLANT. I RECOMMENDED REMOVAL OF THE EXISTING LEFT BREAST IMPLANT, RECONSTRUCTION OF THE ORIGINS OF THE LEFT PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE AND RECONSTRUCTION OF THE LEFT BREAST WITH A FREE ABDOMINAL FLAP. OPERATIVE FINDINGS ON (B)(6) 2011: THE LEFT BREAST IMPLANT CAPSULE WAS OPENED AND CONTAINED A CLOUDY YELLOW FLUID UNDER ENORMOUS PRESSURE, THE FLUID SQUIRTED OUT OF THE CAPSULAR INCISION AND TRAVELED AT LEAST 56 INCHES. THERE WAS A COLLECTION OF GELATINOUS MATERIAL WITHIN THE CAPSULE AS WELL AS AN INTACT SALINE BREAST IMPLANT. THE CAPSULE WAS THICKENED AND COVERED WITH PLAQUE-LIKE LESIONS INTERNALLY. A TOTAL CAPSULECTOMY WAS PERFORMED, THE PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE WAS REATTACHED TO ITS 5TH RIB ORIGINS. THE PERIPROSTHETIC FLUID WAS CAPTURED, AND ALL MATERIAL WAS SENT FOR PATHOLOGIC AND CYTOLOGIC EVALUATION INCLUDING FROZEN SECTION WHICH WAS CONSISTENT WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF ALCL. THE REMAINING RECONSTRUCTION WAS ABANDONED PENDING FINAL PATHOLOGY EVALUATION SPECIMEN. DETAILED PATHOLOGY FINDINGS: LEFT BREAST PERI-PROSTHETIC MATERIAL. LARGE ATYPICAL CELLS PRESENT, MOST CONSISTENT WITH INVOLVEMENT BY ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA IMPLANT, LEFT BREAST IMPLANT CAPSULE, INVOLVEMENT BY ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA.

1976503|16643708|D|1||PATIENT UNDERWENT A BREAST AUGMENTATION WITH MCGHAN TEXTURED SALINE IMPLANTS IN 2001 AND HAD NO PROBLEM UNTIL (B)(6) 2004 WHEN SHE DEVELOPED SOME FLUID AROUND HER LEFT BREAST IMPLANT. SHE UNDERWENT MAMMOGRAPHY AND ULTRASOUND OF THE LEFT BREAST ON (B)(6) 2004, WHICH SHOWED MARKED INCREASED DENSITY WITH FLUID ACCUMULATING AT 360 DEGREES AROUND THE IMPLANT, BUT MOST PROMINENT IN THE LEFT AXILLARY TAIL OF THE IMPLANT. THERE WAS SOME DEBRIS OF DEFECT WITHIN THE FLUID. THE PATIENT THEN UNDERWENT A NEEDLE ASPIRATION OF THE FLUID FROM THE LEFT BREAST AND APPROX. 275 ML OF YELLOWISH FLUID WAS COLLECTED. THE FLUID SHOWED A LARGE ATYPICAL LYMPHOCYTE IN THE BACKGROUND OF MIXED SMALL LYMPHOCYTE AND HISTIOCYTE. IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STUDY PERFORMED ON THE CELL BLOCK SHOWED THAT THESE LYMPHOID CELLS WERE POSITIVE FOR LCA AND NEGATIVE FOR CHEM CAP 5.2 AND CD 68. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS INCLUDED, EXUBERANT REACTIVE LYMPHOID HYPERPLASIA ASSOCIATED WITH BREAST IMPLANT. HOWEVER, A LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDER CANNOT BE COMPLETELY EXCLUDED. PT WAS PLACED ON A COURSE OF CEPHALEXIN AND ADVISED TO RETURN FOR FURTHER PROBLEMS. PATIENT DID WELL UNTIL (B)(6) 2006 WHEN SHE DEVELOPED A RAPID INCREASE IN THE SIZE OF THE LEFT BREAST AND SWELLING OF THE LEFT BREAST. AN ULTRASOUND WAS PERFORMED ON (B)(6) 2006, WHICH SHOWED A LARGE FLUID COLLECTION AROUND THE IMPLANT. THEREFORE, SHE THEN UNDERWENT ULTRASOUND GUIDED DRAINAGE OF THE FLUID COLLECTION AROUND THE BREAST IMPLANT ON (B)(6) 2006 AND APPROXIMATELY 200 ML OF MILKY FLUID WAS ASPIRATED. THE PATIENT HAD THREE MORE ULTRASOUND GUIDED ASPIRATION OF THE LEFT BREAST OVER A THREE MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO SURGICAL INTERVENTION. FOLLOWING THE POST OP RECOVERY TIME, CHOP CHEMOTHERAPY WAS INITIATED ON (B)(6) 2006 EVERY THREE WEEKS FOR A TOTAL OF SIX CYCLES.

2119773|2014999|D|1||I HAD BILATERAL SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS IMPLANTED IN (B)(6) 1990. I DEVELOPED SWELLING AND REDNESS OF THE RIGHT BREAST IN 2002 FOLLOWED BY ENLARGED LYMPH NODES AND SKIN NODULES. I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH NODULAR SCLEROSING HODGKINS OF THE RIGHT AXILLA WHICH SPREAD TO THE SKIN SIX MONTHS LATER. THIS WAS TREATED WITH CHEMO AND RADIATION HOWEVER TWO MONTHS LATER IT RECURRED. I WAS TREATED WITH A STEM CELL TRANSPLANT AND WITHIN 60 DAYS DEVELOPED A 7 CM TUMOR OF THE CHEST WALL SURROUNDING THE RIGHT BREAST IMPLANT AND ENLARGED ANTERIOR MAXILLARY LYMPH NODES. THIS WAS DIAGNOSED AS A RECURRENCE AND TREATED WITH MORE RADIATION. FOUR MONTHS LATER I DEVELOPED MULTIPLE PAINFUL, BLISTERING LESIONS OF THE RIGHT BREAST. THESE WERE BIOPSIED AND DIAGNOSED AS ALCL. THE ONCOLOGIST AND PATHOLOGIST SAID THERE WAS A STRONG POSSIBILITY THAT THE PREVIOUS DIAGNOSIS OF HODGKINS DISEASE WAS INCORRECT AND INDEED I COULD HAVE HAD SYSTEMIC ALCL ALL ALONG. AFTER READING ABOUT THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN ALCL AND BREAST IMPLANTS I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT MY CASE IS INCLUDED FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES.

2358522|16921874|D|1||"I WAS IMPLANTED IN 2005 AND EXPLANTED 2 MONTHS AGO. BEFORE GETTING IMPLANTS, I ASKED MY PLASTIC SURGEON WHAT COMPLICATIONS COULD OCCUR. HE SIMPLY SAID CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR THEY COULD RUPTURE OR LEAK. AND IF THEY LEAKED, IT WOULD ONLY LEAK SALINE INTO MY BODY AND IF THE SCAR CAPSULES GOT HARD, THE DR WOULD SIMPLY TAKE THE IMPLANTS OUT. WHEN I ASKED IF MOLD, FUNGUS, OR BACTERIA COULD GROW IN MY IMPLANTS, BECAUSE IT IS IN A MOIST ENCLOSED DARK AREA JUST SITTING THERE, HE SAID ABSOLUTELY NOT! HE SAID THE REASON WAS THE WATER WILL BE IN A CLOSED, STERILE ENVIRONMENT. I ASKED MY PLASTIC SURGEON ABOUT ALL THE WOMEN WHO HAD FILED LAW SUITS WHO SAID THEY HAD IMMUNE DISORDERS ISSUES. HE SAID STUDIES HAVE FOUND THOSE WOMEN HAD PREDISPOSED MEDICAL ISSUES, AND THOSE WERE WOMEN WITH SILICONE IMPLANTS. THESE WERE SALINE, AND THEREFORE COULDN'T HARM ME. I WAS ALSO NEVER TOLD IF FOR SOME REASON I HAD TO GET MY IMPLANTS REMOVED, MY BREASTS WOULD OR COULD LOOK DEFORMED. I COULD NOT MAKE AN INFORMED CHOICE ABOUT GETTING IMPLANTS BECAUSE I WAS ONLY TOLD THE PRETTY ABOUT THE IMPLANTS: HOW IT WOULD ENHANCE MY FIGURE AND BALANCE ME OUT. IF I HAD KNOWN I COULD GET SICK, I WOULD NEVER HAVE GOTTEN THE IMPLANTS. I WAS NEVER GIVEN THE BOOKLET ON THE FDA WEB SITE, WHICH THE FDA SUPPOSEDLY REQUIRES TO BE GIVEN TO EACH PT. I WAS JUST SOLD THE BEAUTIFUL STORY OF THE GLORIFIED SALINE BREAST IMPLANT, WHICH I BOUGHT HOOK, LINE, AND SINKER. BEFORE MY IMPLANTS, I HAD RUN 3 MARATHONS, 4 HALF MARATHONS, AND MANY 5K'S. ABOUT 3 - 4 YEARS AFTER GETTING MY IMPLANTS, I GOT VERY SICK. I COULD NOT WORK OUT ANYMORE. MY HAIR WAS FALLING OUT, MEMORY ISSUES, I HAD TERRIBLE FATIGUE, AND ACHES AND PAINS IN MY KNEES, HIPS, NECK AND BACK. I WAS BLOATED, HAD FREQUENT FEVERS RESULTING IN CHILLS AND SHAKES, THROWING UP, CONSTIPATION, VAGINITIS, CANDIDA ISSUES WHICH WAS SHOWING UP IN MY BLOOD AND SINUSES. ONE OF THE SCARY THINGS THAT WOULD OCCUR WAS THAT THERE WERE TIMES MY STOMACH WAS SO INFLAMED, MY FOOD WOULD JUST SIT AND NOT DIGEST. THIS WOULD CAUSE MY HEART TO RACE AND MY BODY TO SHAKE. I WOULD HAVE TO THROW IT UP IN ORDER TO FEEL BETTER AGAIN. I MISSED A LOT OF WORK. THANK GOODNESS I WORK FOR A FABULOUS COMPANY. WHEN MY IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED, I HAD ASPERGILUS NIGER AND FUNGUS. I STILL HAVE SOME FUNGAL ISSUES, BUT I AM 80% BETTER THAN I WAS! I HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO WORK OUT FOR A YEAR AND A HALF, WHEREAS THANKS TO GOD, I CAN NOW WEIGHT TRAIN AND WORK OUT ON THE ELLIPTICAL. I HAVE SPENT (B)(6) IN THE PAST 2 YEARS ON DOCTORS, MEDICATIONS AND PROCEDURES JUST TO GET BETTER. I HAD THOUGHT MY IMPLANTATION WOULD ONLY COST (B)(6). I DON'T KNOW HOW OFTEN THESE KINDS OF HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE CAUSED BY BREAST IMPLANTS IN OTHERS, BUT GUESS WHAT, NEITHER DOES ANYONE IN THIS ROOM. THE REASON WE DON'T KNOW, IS BECAUSE THE STUDIES HAVE ASKED THE WRONG QUESTIONS. I DON'T THINK THIS IS COINCIDENTAL. I THINK WHEN IMPLANT COMPANIES AND PLASTIC SURGEONS PAY FOR OR CONDUCT STUDIES ON BREAST IMPLANTS, THEY ASK QUESTIONS WHICH MAKE IMPLANTS SEEM SAFE. I'M HERE TO SAY IT IS TIME TO FIND OUT WHAT THE REAL RISKS ARE OF BREAST IMPLANTS, INCLUDING SALINE AND SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS. MEANWHILE, EVEN IF DOCTORS THINK THE KINDS OF PROBLEMS I HAD ARE RARE, IT SHOULD BE MANDATORY FOR DOCTORS TO DISCLOSE TO POTENTIAL PTS THAT SOME WOMEN GET VERY SICK FROM THEIR IMPLANTS. WHY ISN'T THERE A WARNING LABEL ON BREAST IMPLANTS LIKE THERE ARE ON MOST EVERY OTHER DRUG OR MEDICAL PROCEDURE/SURGERY OUT THERE? I KNOW THE TRUTH, BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE AND ALSO BECAUSE I HAVE TALKED TO MANY OTHER WOMEN WITH SIMILAR EXPERIENCES WITH THEIR IMPLANTS. IT IS TIME FOR THE FDA TO REQUIRE STUDIES OF WOMEN WHO ARE SICK FROM THEIR IMPLANTS TO SEE IF THEY RECOVER WHEN THEIR IMPLANTS ARE REMOVED. ONCE I FIGURED OUT MY IMPLANTS WERE THE CAUSE OF MY SICKNESS, I JOINED A COUPLE OF ONLINE FORUMS TO SEEK OTHER WOMEN WHO WERE EXPERIENCING THE SAME THING. IT WAS AMAZING HOW MANY WOMEN ALL HAD SIMILAR REACTIONS AND HEALTH PROBLEMS -- (B)(6). THERE ARE A LOT OF US OUT THERE. MANY OF THESE WOMEN WEREN'T AS LUCKY AS I WAS, BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T AFFORD TO GET THEIR IMPLANTS REMOVED. INSTEAD, THESE LADIES ARE GETTING SICKER AND SICKER. SOME HAVE DIED, SOME HAVE ORGANS SHUTTING DOWN, MAKING THEM TOO SICK FOR SURGERY. AND SOME HAVE COMMITTED SUICIDE. I WONDER HOW MANY WOMEN HAVE COMMITTED SUICIDE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THEM AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO GET BETTER. ALMOST ALL THE WOMEN HAD SIMILAR STORIES WITH THEIR PLASTIC SURGEON DENYING BREAST IMPLANTS CAUSE SUCH PROBLEMS. THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY SO MANY WOMEN GOT SICKER AND SICKER, GOING TO DR AFTER DR TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS WRONG SINCE THEY WERE TOLD IMPLANTS WERE NOT THE CAUSE OF THEIR SYMPTOMS. I AM ASKING YOU TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, SO THAT OTHER WOMEN WON'T GO THROUGH THIS. THERE ARE DOCTORS WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO HELP THEIR IMPLANT PTS SO THEY FEED THEM ANTIDEPRESSANTS. EVEN IF WOMEN ARE TOLD THEIR IMPLANTS WILL NOT LAST A LIFETIME, THEY DON'T REALIZE THIS MEANS MANY IMPLANTS LAST ONLY 10 YEARS. AND MAMMOGRAPHY TECHS HAVE TOLD ME THEY ARE TOLD IMPLANTS ONLY LAST 5 - 6 YEARS. I PLEAD WITH YOU TO NOT IGNORE THIS GROWING EPIDEMIC OF WOMEN WITH AGING IMPLANTS AND SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS. NOT EVERYONE GETS SICK, BUT THOSE OF US WHO DO PAY DEARLY. PLEASE USE MY EXAMPLE TO ADVISE THE FDA THEY SHOULD NOT BE USING SALINE IMPLANT PTS AS A ""CONTROL GROUP"" TO STUDY THE RISKS OF SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LOCAL COMPLICATIONS ARE SIMILAR FOR ALL BREAST IMPLANTS, AND EVEN THE AUTOIMMUNE SYMPTOMS CAN BE SIMILAR. STUDIES COMPARING SILICONE PTS TO SALINE PTS MIGHT CONCLUDE THEY DON'T DIFFER, BUT IT DOES NOT MEAN EITHER TYPE OF IMPLANT IS SAFE. STUDIES SHOULD COMPARE IMPLANT PTS TO WOMEN WHO DO NOT HAVE IMPLANTS, TO FIND OUT HOW MANY ARE LIKELY TO BE SERIOUSLY HARMED AFTER 5 YEARS, 10 YEARS, OR 20 YEARS. WHAT IS TRULY SAD IS I HAVE HAD SEVERAL WOMEN CONTACT ME SINCE JUNE OF THIS YEAR WHO ARE EXTREMELY SICK FROM THEIR SILICONE AND SALINE IMPLANTS... ONE IS A STATE ATTORNEY WHO IS IN..."|INAMED/MCGHAN|25-68421|11/22/2011||||Y|||0HP|FWM|1.0||BREAST IMPLANT SALINE||68-420|||SANTA BARBARA|US|MCGHAN|93111|CA|93111||||True

EXAM WAS CONSISTENT WITH AN INFECTED BREAST IMPLANT, THEREFORE, THE IMPLANT WAS REMOVED IN THE OFFICE UNDER LOCAL ANESTHESIA. HER EPIDERMOLYSIS EVENTUALLY CLEARED AND THE INFECTION IMPROVED. HOWEVER, SHE DEVELOPED AN INFLAMMATORY ABSCESS IN THE INFRAMAMMARY PORTION OF THE RIGHT BREAST THAT REQUIRED OPERATIVE EXCISION AND DEBRIDEMENT UNDER ANESTHESIA. THE TISSUE THAT WAS REMOVED AND SENT TO THE LABORATORY CAME BACK ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA. THIS BREAST EVENTUALLY WENT ON TO HEAL. SHE WAS SEEN IN CONSULTATION AT (B)(6) AND RECEIVED CHEMOTHERAPY. BECAUSE OF THE POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION OF THE CANCER WITH THE IMPLANT, ALONG WITH HER ASYMMETRY ISSUES, SHE REQUESTED REMOVAL OF THE LEFT IMPLANT, WHICH WAS DONE UNEVENTFULLY.

3840198|4613594|D|1||"IN 1997 AFTER A HYSTERECTOMY, I HAD LOST ALMOST ALL MY BREAST FORM AND TISSUE DUE TO LACK OF HORMONES. I RECEIVED MCGHAN SALINE IMPLANTS BUT WITHIN 2 MONTHS, I DEFLATED. I OPTED TO HAVE GEL BREAST IMPLANTS IN 1998. IN 2006 I FELT THAT THOSE IMPLANTS WERE LEAKING AND SO I SCHEDULED AN MRI. THE MRI WAS SENT TO THE SURGEON WHO DID THE IMPLANTS. AT THE APPOINTMENT, I ASKED HER IF SHE HAD READ THE MRI AND SHE SAID ""THAT MRI'S WERE NOT RELIABLE"" AND THAT THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW WAS TO HAVE SURGERY. I RECEIVED A QUOTE FOR OVER (B)(6) DOLLARS AND DID NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO PURSUE THE SURGERY. I TOOK HER WORD THAT THE MRI WAS NOT RELIABLE. SOON AFTER THAT I STARTED HAVING MANY ILLNESS SYMPTOMS INCLUDING MS, LUPUS, GUILLAIN-BARRE, AUTO IMMUNE DISORDER, ETC. I SAW 7 SPECIALISTS INCLUDING A NEUROLOGIST AT (B)(6), ENDOCRINOLOGISTS, AN ORAL SURGEON, AND INTERNISTS. NONE OF THEM SEEMED TO KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG. I ALSO SAW A DOCTOR IN (B)(6) WHO RAN HAIR ANALYSIS AND BLOOD WORK THAT SHOWED MANY OF MY FUNCTIONS - I.E.: LIVER, WHITE BLOOD COUNT, THYROID, ADRENALS, ETC., WERE NOT NORMAL. OVER THE LAST 6-7 YEARS MY SYMPTOMS HAVE CONTINUED TO WORSEN, MORE TESTS, AND NO ANSWERS. IN (B)(6) 2014, I DECIDED TO SEE A SECOND DOCTOR HERE IN (B)(6), A PLASTIC SURGEON, AND TOLD HIM THAT I FELT MY IMPLANTS MAY BE LEAKING. HE BLEW ME OFF AND DID NOT AGREE THAT LEAKING IMPLANTS CAUSE HEALTH ISSUES. AT THIS POINT, I DECIDED TO MOVE OUT OF TRADITIONAL MEDICINE DUE TO NO ANSWERS OR HELP FOR MY CONDITIONS. DUE TO ALL MY SYMPTOMS, SOME WHICH INCLUDE: PARTIAL PARALYSIS, HEADACHES, CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDER, GRAVES DISEASE, SHAKINESS, TREMORS, ETC., I STARTED SEEING DR (B)(6) WHO PRACTICES (B)(6) MEDICINE AND ACUPUNCTURE HERE IN (B)(6). AFTER A FEW TREATMENTS, I WAS GETTING ONLY PARTIAL RESULTS. I MENTIONED TO HIM THAT I THOUGHT MY SILICONE IMPLANTS MAY MBE LEAKING. HE IMMEDIATELY FELT THAT WAS WHAT WAS CAUSING ALL MY SYMPTOMS. HE SAID HE HAS HAD MANY PATIENTS OVER THE YEARS WHO HAD IMPLANTS LEAKING AND SOME WERE SO SICK THEY COULD NOT EVEN HAVE THE SURGERY FOR REMOVAL. I WAS REFERRED TO DR (B)(6). I GOOGLED HER ONLINE AND FOUND THAT SHE WAS SPECIALIZED IN IMPLANT EXPLANTATION AND WAS DOUBLE BOARD CERTIFIED. SHE HAS DONE OVER 3,000 EXPLANT PROCEDURES. I MET WITH DR (B)(6) IN (B)(6) AND SHE SPENT LOTS OF TIME EXPLAINING HOW LEAKING IMPLANTS COULD CAUSE ALL THESE HEALTH ISSUES. AFTER EXAMINATION, SHE DEFINITELY FELT MY IMPLANTS WERE LEAKING AND/OR RUPTURED. DR (B)(6) RECOMMENDED THAT THIS WAS MEDICALLY NECESSARY FOR ME TO CONTINUE TO STAY ALIVE. I CONTACTED MCGHAN REGARDING MY IMPLANTS. THEY TOLD ME THEY SHOW THAT IN 2006 MY IMPLANTS WERE STILL UNDER WARRANTY AND ASKED FOR A COPY OF THE MRI. I CONTACTED MY SURGEON IN (B)(6) WHO DID THE ORIGINAL SURGERY AND ASKED THEM IF THEY HAD MY MRI FROM 2006. IMAGINE MY SURPRISE WHEN IT SAID THAT THE RIGHT IMPLANT WAS RUPTURED WAY BACK THEN! SHE HAD NEVER SHARED THIS REPORT WITH ME. THE SURGERY WAS COMPLETED ON (B)(6) 2014. THE RIGHT IMPLANT WAS TOTALLY DETERIORATED FROM A RUPTURE AND THERE WAS SO MUCH SILICONE THAT THE OPERATING ROOM NURSE SAID THIS WAS ONE OF THE WORST SHE HAD EVER SEEN. THE LEFT IMPLANT WAS INTACT BUT LEAKING. THE COST OF THE REMOVAL INCLUDING ANESTHESIA AND SURGERY CENTER WAS (B)(6) DOLLARS. AT THIS POINT MCGHAN HAS SAID THEY WILL ONLY COVER UP TO (B)(6) DOLLARS PER IMPLANT IF RUPTURED. I HAD TO BORROW THIS MONEY AS ALL THESE FEES HAD TO BE PAID UP FRONT BUT I KNEW MY LIFE DEPENDED ON IT. THE MONEY FOR THIS LOAN HAS TO BE REPAID BY (B)(6) 2014. I DO NOT KNOW WHERE I AM GOING TO GET THIS MONEY. I FEEL THAT MCGHAN SHOULD PAY FOR THIS REMOVAL. THEIR PRODUCT WAS OBVIOUSLY DEFECTIVE WHILE UNDER WARRANTY AND NO ONE INFORMED ME ABOUT THE MRI REPORT. IN 1997 I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PART OF AN (B)(6) STUDY BUT NO ONE EVER FOLLOWED UP OR CONTACTED ME. A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT WAS SETTLED IN 2010 WITH MCGHAN (ALLERGAN) BUT I WAS NEVER CONTACTED.

I WOULD LIKE TO REPORT THAT I HAD BILATERAL 270CC GEL FILLED MCGHAN TEXTURED, ROUND, SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS FROM (B)(6) 1991, PUT IN BY DR. (B)(6) IN (B)(6). HE DID A WONDERFUL JOB AND I HAD NO COMPLAINTS. AFTER 23 YEARS, THE IMPLANTS WERE NOT EVEN RUPTURED. THEY DID EXACTLY WHAT THE MANUFACTURER MADE THEM TO DO. HOWEVER, I HAD A LONG LIST OF CHRONIC, DEBILITATING SYMPTOMS, COMMON TO OTHERS WITH IMPLANTS. IT WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE ME GO THROUGH WITH EXPLANTATION. I AM NOW 2 WEEKS POST OP AND I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MANY ISSUES HAVE ALREADY RESOLVED. I WANT TO TELL YOU MY STORY SO THAT YOU CAN RECORD MY EXPERIENCE AND INFORM OTHER WOMEN CONSIDERING IMPLANTS OR EXPLANTATION. OF THE DOZENS OF PLASTIC SURGEONS THAT I CALLED SEEKING EXPLANTATION, ONLY 3 EVEN ACKNOWLEDGED THE ISSUES AND SPEAK OUT ABOUT IT. THE REST ARE SOLD OUT TO THE MANUFACTURERS AND DENY ALL OF IT. PLEASE BE VOCAL ABOUT THIS SERIOUS HEALTH THREAT. I STRUGGLED DAILY WITH THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS, RIGHT UP UNTIL THE DAY OF SURGERY, AND ALL OF THESE HAVE RESOLVED: FOUL SMELLING URINE - GONE. NO ONE COULD EVER FIGURE THIS OUT. EVEN WHEN I STOPPED ALL SUPPLEMENTS, WENT HIGH CARB LOW FAT LOW SODIUM VEGAN, TRIED GOING RAW, NOTHING CHANGED THE SMELL OF THE URINE. BLADDER PAIN, INFLAMMATION, IRRITATION, BURNING, URGENCY, FREQUENCY. (I HAD INTERSTITIAL CYSTITIS) - GONE. PAIN BELOW RIGHT BREAST, IN WHAT FELT LIKE MY LIVER AREA. SUFFERED FOR YEARS WITH THIS ""PULLING"" THAT WAS ACTUALLY FROM THE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE ON THAT SIDE. ESPECIALLY WHEN I WOULD LIE ON MY BACK. GONE WHEN I AWOKE FROM SURGERY. CHEST WALL PAIN - GONE. HIP, KNEE AND SHOULDER JOINT PAIN, PAIN IN JOINT OF BIG TOE, MUSCLE PAIN IN THIGHS, BUTTOCKS AND DOWN THE LEGS. MUSCLE TWITCHING AND WEAKNESS. CLICKING/CATCHING IN NECK - GONE. COLD HANDS AND FEET, WOULD TURN PURPLE - GONE. MY HUSBAND CAN'T BELIEVE HOW WARM MY HANDS AND FEET STAY NOW. I'M NOT COLD ALL THE TIME. I HAVEN'T TURNED THE HEATER ON IN OUR ROOM ONCE AND I NEVER LIVED WITHOUT IT BEFORE. BRAIN FOG, MUCH IMPROVED. I KNEW WHAT DAY IT WAS WHEN I SIGNED PAPERWORK AT THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE ON DAY 3. THIS WAS SUCH A PROBLEM BEFORE. EVEN WHEN I SIGNED PAPERS AT MY CONSULTATION THE DAY BEFORE, I DIDN'T KNOW THE DATE AND HAD TO ASK. THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT DAY, AND I COULD NOT RECALL THE DATE. I CAN DIAL A PHONE NUMBER WITHOUT HAVING TO LOOK BACK AT THE NUMBER 3 TIMES. FATIGUE, SO MUCH BETTER. I FEEL WONDERFUL. MY ADRENAL GLANDS WORKED OVERTIME, ALL OF THE TIME. I FELT ZAPPED. NOW, I HAVE GREAT ENERGY. SLUGGISH COLON, SO MUCH BETTER. I GO EVERY DAY NOW. I WAS GOING 3-10 DAYS WITHOUT A BM. I AM TAKING THE MAGNESIUM AND PROBIOTICS, PER DR. (B)(6). WHAT A DIFFERENCE. I HAD TRIED MANY THINGS, THOUGH. BEFORE MY EXPLANT, EVEN MIRALAX FAILED. SO, I THINK REMOVING THE IMPLANTS HELPED, ALONG WITH THE MAGNESIUM AND PROBIOTICS. SKIN RASH ON THE OUTSIDE OF MY ARMS AND BACKS OF MY HANDS WERE GONE IN ABOUT 4 DAYS. THAT HAD BEEN AROUND FOR A FEW WEEKS. OVERALL SKIN IMPROVED. DRYNESS AND BUMPS - GONE. ALLERGY SYMPTOMS WERE CONSTANT. CHEMICALLY SENSITIVE TO EVERYTHING. I WOKE EVERY MORNING WITH ITCHY, WATERY, PAINFUL, BLOODSHOT EYES WHICH STAYED THAT WAY MOST OF THE DAY AND SOMETIMES GOT WORSE - TOTALLY GONE. PAINFUL TEETH AND SWOLLEN LYMPH NODES IN MY NECK - GONE. I CAN'T REMEMBER WHEN MY LYMPH NODES FELT THIS SMALL AND DID NOT HURT. FRONTAL HEADACHES, SINUS PRESSURE AND PAIN - GONE. SHOCKING PAINS DOWN BOTH ARMS FROM THE ARM PITS - GONE. FEET NO LONGER PUFFY AND PAINFUL WHEN THEY HIT THE FLOOR. MY TEMPERATURE HAS REGULATED. MY FACE IS NOT PUFFY WITH THE RED PATCH ACROSS MY CHEEKS AND NOSE. HOW IS THIS? HOW COULD A BODY BY SO BURDENED FROM ""INTACT"" IMPLANTS? THE BODY'S RESPONSE IS TO GET RID OF IT. THIS IS HELL ON YOUR HEALTH. TELL WOMEN THE TRUTH.

I FEEL THAT THE RISK OF ILL HEALTH FROM BOTH SILICONE AND SALINE POISONING FROM THE IMPLANTS SHOULD BE MADE MORE ASSESSABLE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC BEFORE THEY GO UNDER THE KNIFE AND START TO SUFFER FROM BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESS AFTER IMPLANTATION. SOMETIME SYMPTOMS CAN TAKE YEARS TO DEVELOP SO THE PREVIOUS STUDIES THAT ONLY LASTED THREE YEARS ARE NOT RELEVANT IN REPORTING THAT THESE DEVICES ARE SAFE. FURTHER STUDIES AND TESTS NEED TO BE PERFORMED LONG TERM IN ORDER TO GAIN THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF RISK TO HEALTH INVOLVED.|SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT||11/22/2015||||*|*||I|FTR|2.0||SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT||205092|||||MCGHAN|||||||True

THE DARN IMPLANTS HAVE BEEN LEAKING AS PER THE BIOPSY THAT I JUST WAS NOTIFIED ABOUT I HAVE SILICONE IN MY TISSUE EVEN THOUGH MY IMPLANTS DID NOT HAVE A NORMAL BREAK IN THEM.
