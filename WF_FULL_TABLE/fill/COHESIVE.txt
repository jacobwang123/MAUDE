6247187|66742201|N|1||THE EVENTS OF LYMPHOMA-ALCL, LATE SEROMA AND INFLAMMATION ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THESE EVENTS. DEVICE HISTORY RECORD (DHR) SUMMARY: REVIEW OF DHR FOR WORK ORDER 1321464 DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY DEVIATIONS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS OR NON-CONFORMANCES DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. ALL GEL BREAST IMPLANTS WERE REVIEWED AS PART OF THE ASSEMBLY OPERATIONS AND THESE TASKS WERE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO APPLICABLE CURRENT PROCEDURES TO ENSURE THAT ASSEMBLY MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. THE DHR ASSEMBLY REPORT WAS VERIFIED AND THERE WAS NOT ANY SCRAP RELATED WITH REPORTED EVENT, ALL DEVICES WERE CONFORMANCE DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION GATHERED DURING THE DHR REVIEW, THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT DEVICES FROM WORK ORDER 1321464 WERE ASSEMBLED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALLERGAN MEDICAL PROCEDURES AND SPECIFICATIONS. THE REPORTED DEVICE WAS INTACT AT THE TIME OF PRODUCTION AND MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. REPORTED EVENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN DEVICE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY.|STYLE 410 COHESIVE SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|27-MX115-290|01/12/2017|||DA|N|R||0HP|FTR|1.0|09/04/2011|PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||1321464|KILBRIDE INDUSTRIAL ESTATE||ARKLOW, COUNTY WICKLOW||ALLERGAN (ARKLOW)|||||||True|False|False|True

SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT.

ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM.

20211|14895|D|1||BECAUSE OF FIBROCYSTIC DISEASE, RPTR HAD RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY 12/20/76 WITH ANOTHER CO'S IMPLANTS. DUE TO SCAR CONTRACTURE AND TWO UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS AT CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, BOTH IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED AND THE SAME IMPLANTS WERE REINSERTED. IN 1979, THE LEFT IMPLANT WAS REPLACED WITH THIS CO'S DOUBLE LUMEN GEL/SALINE IMPLANT. AFTER EXPLANTATION SURGERY 8/17/94, LAB ANALYSIS REPORT FROM DR WAS OBTAINED EXPLAINING THE PROBLEMS WITH FAILED IMPLANTS. THE DEVICE FROM THE CONTAINER IDENTIFIED AS THE LEFT SIDE WAS EVIDENTLY THE REPLACEMENT FOR A FAILIED IMPLANT FROM THE PREVIOUS SURGERY. IT WAS IDENTIFIED AS A DOUBLE LUMEN CONSISTENT WITH PRODUCTION CIRCA 1977-78. THE CRITERIA OF IDENTIFICATION INCLUDE A LEAF VALVE EXCLUSIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CO'S PRODUCTS. THIS IS NOT A SALINE IMPLANT, IT IS A COMBINATION GEL WITH ADDED SALINE IN A SEPARATE COMPARMENT. THE LEFT IMPLANT HAD PERFORATED INNER AND OUTER SHELLS AND WAS SEVERELY CONTAMINATED BY TISSUE AND POSSIBLY MICRO-ORGANISMS AND THEIR METABOLITES. THE GEL LEAKED PROFUSELY THROUGH MULTIPLE PERFORATIONS. THE GEL WAS ALSO INVASIVE AND OF AN EASILY DISPERSED NATURE. THE LOSS OF GEL PROPERTY (REVERSION FROM A COHESIVE PRODUCT TO AN OIL-LIKE ENTITY) IS A SIGN OF CHEMICAL DEGRADATION. THE CAPSULE RECEIVED IN THE CONTAINER INDICATING THE RIGHT SIDE SHOWS A DISORGANIZED MASS OF TISSUE CONSISTENT WITH SEVERE ADVERSE REACTIONS AND FAILURE OF THE CAPSULE TO CONTAIN THE DEBRIS OF A GROSSLY LEAKING PROSTHESIS. IT ALSO INDICATES MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS AT CLOSED CAPSULOTOMIES AND POSSIBLE INFECTION. NODULAR PORTIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH GRANULOMATOUS MATERIALS FROM A PT WHO RECEIVED MULTIPLE IMPLANTS AND WHERE DEBRIDEMENT OF THE TISSUE (ABLATIVE CAPSULECTOMY) WAS NOT PERFORMED AT THE TIME OF PROSTHESIS REPLACEMENT. THE CAPSULE RECEIVED IN THE CONTAINER INDICATING THE LEFT SIDE WAS EXTENSIVELY CALCIFIED WITH PLAQUE-LIKE ENTITIES. THESE SUGGEST A PROLONGED EXPOSURE TO AGGRESSIVE CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES RESULTING IN NECROSIS AND MINERALIZATION. IT APPEARS MOST PROBLEM THAT THE CAPSULES WERE TRANSPOSED SOME TIME AFTER SURGERY. IN PRINCIPLE, THE CALCIFIED CAPSULE SHOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DOUBLE LUMEN IMPLANT. (ALSO SEE 1005399.)

314784|202369|D|1||"SINCE HAVING ""SOYA BEAN"" BREAST IMPLANTS, RPTR HAS BEEN HAVING PROBLEMS TWO YEARS AFTER THE IMPLANTS. CHRONIC TIREDNESS, DOUBLE VISION AND DIPLOPIA. RPTR HAS NOW BEEN UNDER SEVERAL NEUROLOGISTS WHO ARE TESTING THEM FOR AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES. ALL RESULTS CAME BACK NEGATIVE. DURING THESE TESTS BREAST IMPLANTS WERE RECALLED. RPTR HAD THEM REMOVED IN 1999. RPTR HAS FELT A SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT IN HEALTH IN THE SHORT 6 WEEKS THAT HAVE FOLLOWED. HOWEVER, RPTR HAS HAD THEM REPLACED WITH SILICONE COHESIVE GEL IMPLANTS. RPTR IS EXPECTING A RECOVERY TO TAKE PLACE FOR A FEW MONTHS. HOWEVER RPTR FEELS THEY MAY ALSO GET SYMPTOMS FROM THE NEW ONES DUE TO AN EVIDENCE THAT IT IS ACTUALLY THE SILICONE BAG WHICH DISINTEGRATES SLIGHTLY AND SENDS SILICA AROUND YOUR BODY. RPTR RECKONS THIS MAY TAKE UP TO 2 YEARS. AT THE FIRST SIGN OF CHRONIC TIREDNESS ETC - AS BAD AS RPTR WAS AT FIRST, BEFORE THE REMOVAL RPTR WILL HAVE THEM COMPLETELY REMOVED. RPTR IMAGINES A DEFORMED BREAST MUCH SMALLER, STRETCHED AND DISFIGURED WILL BE LEFT BEHIND. WHAT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF THIS WILL BE THEY DON'T KNOW. RPTR DOES KNOW IT CAN'T BE WORSE THAN WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH SINCE THE ONSET OF SYMPTOMS. IF IT WILL IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH HAVING THEM COMPLETELY REMOVED, RPTR WILL DO IT. RPTR SUGGESTS NEW STUDIES ARE CARRIED OUT TO STOP ALL IMPLANTS MADE WITH A SILICONE BAG, DESPITE WHAT THEY CONTAIN. RPTR THINKS THE ONLY TRUE WAY TO DO THIS IS STUDIES ON NEUROSURGEONS PTS. THESE ARE THE GUYS WHO GET TO SEE RPTR'S COMPLICATIONS FIRST. RPTR THINKS ALL PTS SEEING A NEUROLOGIST SHOULD BE ASKED IF THEY HAVE IMPLANTS. RPTR'S NEVER ASKED THEM.

""A PREPECTORAL SILICONE IMPLANT IS NOTED IN PLACE WITH INTACT SALINE ENVELOPE."" THIS HAS BEEN AN ISSUE BECAUSE UPON GETTING A SECOND AND THIRD OPINION, BECAUSE THERE IS NO SALINE.

YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. THERE WERE 9 PRIMARY AUGMENTATION PATIENTS (1.9%) WITH A NEW DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER THROUGH 10 YEARS IN THE ALLERGAN PIVOTAL STUDY. IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION PATIENTS, THERE WAS 1 REPORT OF SKIN CANCER AND 1 REPORT OF RENAL CELL CANCER, AND 1 PRIMARY AUGMENTATION PATIENT WHO WAS PREGNANT AT THE TIME OF IMPLANTATION GAVE BIRTH TO A CHILD WHO LATER DEVELOPED HISTIOCYTOSIS. THERE WAS 1 REVISION-AUGMENTATION PATIENT (0.8%) WITH A NEW DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER THROUGH 10 YEARS AND 1 PATIENT REPORT OF BLADDER CANCER AND 1 PATIENT REPORT OF MULTIPLE MYELOMA. THERE WERE 17 RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS (7.6%) WITH RECURRENCE OF BREAST CANCER THROUGH 10 YEARS, 1 REPORT OF NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA AND 1 REPORT OF UTERINE CANCER. THERE WERE NO REVISION-RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS WHO REPORTED A RECURRENCE OF BREAST CANCER THROUGH 10 YEARS AND NO REPORTS OF OTHER CANCERS IN REVISION-RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. ONE RECONSTRUCTION PATIENT IN THE PIVOTAL STUDY WAS REPORTED WITH ALCL THROUGH 10 YEARS. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. LITERATURE REPORTS HAVE ALSO BEEN MADE ASSOCIATING SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS WITH VARIOUS RHEUMATOLOGICAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS SUCH AS FATIGUE, EXHAUSTION, JOINT PAIN AND SWELLING, MUSCLE PAIN AND CRAMPING, TINGLING, NUMBNESS, WEAKNESS, AND SKIN RASHES.|STYLE 410 COHESIVE SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|MF-410335|04/16/2015||02/25/2013|DA|Y|Y||0HP|FTR|1.0|02/02/2011|nan||1223847|||ARKLOW, COUNTY WICKLOW|EI|ALLERGAN|||||||True|False|False|True

YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL.

DEVICE LABELING ADDRESSES: ""BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGAN'S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERS' BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: ...REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, HEMATOMA/SEROMA."""|STYLE 410 COHESIVE SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|27-FF125-375|11/16/2016||||*|*||0HP|FTR|1.0|11/08/2011|PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||1359584|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True|False|False|True
