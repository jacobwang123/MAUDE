DEVICE LABELING: SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANTS ARE PRONE TO UNINTENDED INSTRUMENT TRAUMA DURING IMPLANTATION OR DURING EXPLANTATION. NUMBER 1, 2 SHELL FAILURE CAN RESULT FROM DAMAGE BY SCALPELS, SUTURE NEEDLES, HYPODERMIC NEEDLES, HEMOSTATS, AND ADSON FORCEPS AND HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN EXPLANTED DEVICE SHELLS USING SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY. ALLERGANÂ¿S (RETRIEVAL STUDY) ANALYSES OF EXPLANTED DEVICES HAVE IDENTIFIED UNINTENDED SURGICAL INSTRUMENT DAMAGE AS ONE POTENTIAL CAUSE OF SHELL FAILURE AND THUS IMPLANT RUPTURE. THE PATIENT SHOULD BE TOLD THAT THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGE IN THE IMPLANT SHAPE MAY BE SIGNS OF SYMPTOMATIC RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. IF THE PATIENT HAS ANY OF THESE SIGNS, SHE SHOULD BE TOLD TO REPORT THEM AND POSSIBLY HAVE AN MRI EVALUATION TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. BREAST IMPLANTS RUPTURE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. RUPTURES CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO RUPTURE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, STRESSING THE IMPLANT DURING IMPLANTATION AND WEAKENING IT, FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL, EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED), TRAUMA, COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING, AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF RUPTURE FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT. IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF RUPTURE. LABORATORY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RUPTURE ARE ONGOING. SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SEE TABLE 3 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING MRI SCREENING. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE. IF RUPTURE OCCURS, SILICONE GEL MAY EITHER REMAIN WITHIN THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), MOVE OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE (EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), OR MOVE OUTSIDE THE BREAST (GEL MIGRATION). THERE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY THAT RUPTURE MAY PROGRESS FROM INTRACAPSULAR TO EXTRACAPSULAR AND BEYOND. IN ALLERGANÂ¿S CORE STUDY, THERE WAS A MRI SCREENING COHORT WHO HAD REGULAR MRIS TO SCREEN FOR BREAST IMPLANT RUPTURE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE SYMPTOMATIC (I.E., MRI COHORT) AND A NON-MRI SCREENING COHORT WHO WERE NOT SCREENED WITH BREAST IMPLANT MRIS (I.E., NON-MRI COHORT). THE RUPTURE RATES IN THE MRI COHORTS WERE 9.3% FOR PRIMARY AUGMENTATION, 5.4% FOR REVISION-AUGMENTATION, 35.4% FOR PRIMARY RECONSTRUCTION, AND 0% FOR REVISION-RECONSTRUCTION. THE RUPTURE RATE FOR THE WHOLE MRI COHORT IN THE CORE STUDY (INCLUDING AUGMENTATION, REVISION-AUGMENTATION, RECONSTRUCTION, AND REVISION-RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS) THROUGH 10 YEARS WAS 13.0% FOR PATIENTS AND 7.7% FOR IMPLANTS. ACROSS ALL PATIENTS IN THE CORE STUDY, ALL RUPTURES WERE INTRACAPSULAR WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 3 CASES OF EXTRACAPSULAR GEL (ONE RUPTURE PROGRESSED TO EXTRACAPSULAR GEL FOLLOWING EXPLORATORY SURGERY TO CONFIRM THE RUPTURE AND THEN IMPLANT REPLACEMENT WAS DELAYED).|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|07/21/2017||||N|R||0HP|FWM|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||NI|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

POSSIBLE ADVERSE EVENTS POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION,IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. RUPTURE: BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. BREAST IMPLANTS RUPTURE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. RUPTURES CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO RUPTURE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, STRESSING THE IMPLANT DURING IMPLANTATION AND WEAKENING IT, FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL, EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED), TRAUMA, COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING, AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF RUPTURE FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT. IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF RUPTURE. LABORATORY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RUPTURE ARE ONGOING. SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE. IF RUPTURE OCCURS, SILICONE GEL MAY EITHER REMAIN WITHIN THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), MOVE OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE (EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), OR MOVE OUTSIDE THE BREAST (GEL MIGRATION). THERE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY THAT RUPTURE MAY PROGRESS FROM INTRACAPSULAR TO EXTRACAPSULAR AND BEYOND.|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|07/24/2017||||N|R||0HP|FWM|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||NI|||||nan|||||||True

REPORTED EVENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN THE LABELING: THE PATIENT SHOULD BE TOLD THAT THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGE IN THE IMPLANT SHAPE MAY BE SIGNS OF SYMPTOMATIC RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. IF THE PATIENT HAS ANY OF THESE SIGNS, SHE SHOULD BE TOLD TO REPORT THEM AND POSSIBLY HAVE AN MRI EVALUATION TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT.

ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.|STYLE 110 SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|27-110241|06/07/2017||||N|R||0HP|FTR|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||NI|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM.

6575692|75546313|D|1||MY SITUATION WAS AS SUCH: IN (B)(6) 2015 AFTER BEING DIAGNOSED WITH DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS) FOR A THIRD TIME IN 12 YEARS, I HAD A MASTECTOMY WITH IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION ON MY RIGHT SIDE, WITH A MENTOR GEL-FILLED IMPLANT. WITHIN TWO MONTHS OF MY OPERATION, I HAD AN ODD PERSPIRATION ODOR WHICH REMAINED WITH ME PERMANENTLY. IN THE SPRING OF 2016, I BEGAN FEELING TIRED AFTER MY GYM WORKOUTS, QUITE UNUSUAL AS I HAD ALWAYS EXERCISED REGULARLY, AND I WAS IN PERFECT HEALTH. BY (B)(6) 2016, I BEGAN EXPERIENCING TINGLING AND NUMBNESS IN MY FINGERS, WHICH WAS NOT GOING AWAY. I THEN BEGAN TO HAVE SWOLLEN FINGERS, HANDS AND WRISTS IN (B)(6) OF THE SAME YEAR, WHICH LED TO MY BEING DIAGNOSED WITH CARPEL TUNNEL SYNDROME BY A RHEUMATOLOGIST. THE RHEUMATOLOGIST TOOK BLOOD TESTS AND RESULTS SHOWED I HAD AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE KNOWN AS SCLERODERMA. I WAS SHOCKED AS NOTHING LIKE THIS WAS EVER HEARD OF IN MY FAMILY. I COME FROM A LONG LINE OF HEALTHY PEOPLE WHO MOSTLY LIVE INTO THEIR NINETIES. BY THIS TIME, TOO, I BEGAN FEELING MALAISE, AND I THEN WAS WEAKENED TO THE POINT OF BEING UNABLE TO WALK UNAIDED. FROM THE MIDDLE OF (B)(6)(THE DATE MY PLASTIC SURGEON EXPLANTED THE IMPLANT), I BECAME SO DEBILITATED THAT I COULD NO LONGER WALK. I LOST 20LBS OF MUSCLE DURING THIS ABOVE-NOTED PERIOD, AS MY ARM, LEG AND REAR MUSCLES ATROPHIED, RESULTING IN ME BEING TOTALLY DEBILITATED. I WAS IN EXTREME PAIN, AND I BEGAN LOSING MY HAIR. I COULDNÂ¿T THINK CLEARLY, AND I COULD NOT SLEEP. I SUFFERED FROM EXTREME FATIGUE, AND MY JOINTS WERE SWOLLEN, ESPECIALLY MY RIGHT KNEE. I HAD UPPER BACK AND NECK WEAKNESS. I COULD NOT RAISE MY ARMS, MOVE MY LEGS OR USE MY HANDS. ALL SYMPTOMS STARTED ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF MY BODY, AND WERE MORE SEVERE THAN ON THE LEFT SIDE OF MY BODY. WHEN I TOLD THE RHEUMATOLOGIST ON (B)(6), THAT I HAD AN IMPLANT AND THAT I HAD MADE AN APPOINTMENT TO SEE MY PLASTIC SURGEON THE VERY NEXT DAY SHE SAID, Â¿YOU ARE RIGHT TO MENTION THIS TO ME. AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES ARE OFTEN CAUSED BY EXTERNAL REASONS, AND ARE NOT ALWAYS HEREDITARY.Â¿ IN THIS WAY, SHE CONFIRMED THAT IT COULD BE BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESS THAT I WAS SUFFERING FROM. THE NEXT DAY, MY PLASTIC SURGEON AGREED TO EXPLANT MY MENTOR GEL-FILLED IMPLANT STATING THAT HE COULD NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE IMPLANT WAS CAUSING MY DEBILITATION AND THAT I MIGHT NOT REGAIN MY HEALTH. THE SURGERY WAS ON A THURSDAY MORNING, AND I NEEDED A WHEELCHAIR BY THIS TIME. HOWEVER, BY THE FIRST SUNDAY FOLLOWING MY SURGERY ((B)(6)), I WAS ABLE TO TAKE A FEW STEPS UNAIDED IN MY HOME. TWO WEEKS LATER, I WAS APPROVED BY MY MEDICAL INSURANCE COMPANY TO RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING ASSISTANCE IN MY HOME; PHYSICAL THERAPY, OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY, A PERSONAL AIDE, A NURSE AND A SOCIAL WORKER. I WAS ABLE TO HAVE A VISITING NUN COME ONCE A WEEK ALSO. IT IS NOW (B)(6) 2017 AND I AM ABLE TO WALK AGAIN. I WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE SERVICES FROM THE OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST AND THE SOCIAL WORKER. MY PHYSICAL THERAPIST TOLD ME I MUST MAINTAIN AN EXERCISE PROGRAM THAT HE PRESCRIBED FOR ME. MY PERSONAL AIDE AND THE NURSE HAVE STOPPED COMING NOW AS I AM FINALLY SHOWING SIGNS OF RECOVERY. I CONTINUE TO HAVE SWELLING IN MY HANDS AND WEAKNESS IN MY UPPER ARMS, NECK AND BACK. IT IS QUITE DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT THE MENTOR GEL-FILLED IMPLANT WAS LEECHING OR BLEEDING TOXINS INTO MY BODY TO THE EXTENT THAT I WAS TOTALLY DEBILITATED FOR OVER 10 MONTHS OF MY LIFE. I THANK THE RHEUMATOLOGIST FOR VALIDATING THE FACT THAT THE IMPLANT COULD BE THE CAUSE. I HAVE BEEN ON A DETOX DIET SINCE (B)(6) 2016. I WAS UNABLE TO LEAVE MY HOUSE UNAIDED FROM (B)(6) DUE TO THIS ILLNESS. I ONLY LEFT THE HOUSE FOR DOCTOR APPOINTMENTS. I COULD NOT TAKE MYSELF TO THESE APPOINTMENTS.

6749495|81234589|N|1||ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION GATHERED DURING THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD REVIEW, THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT DEVICE WAS ASSEMBLED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALLERGAN MEDICAL PROCEDURES AND SPECIFICATIONS. THE PHYSICIAN ONLY CONFIRMED CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. THE EVENT OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS A PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATION AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THIS EVENT. FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTER REGARDING EVENT, PRODUCT, OR PATIENT DETAILS HAS BEEN REQUESTED. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. DEVICE LABELING: UNDERGOING ANY TYPE OF SURGERY INVOLVES RISKS. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF LOCAL COMPLICATIONS (PROBLEMS AT OR NEAR THE BREAST/SURGICAL INCISION SITE) THAT MAY OCCUR AFTER YOUR BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY. THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS PRESENT RESULTS FROM ALLERGANÂ¿S CORE CLINICAL STUDY CONDUCTED ON NATRELLE Â® SILICONE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANTS. ONE OF THE KEY COMPLICATIONS REPORTED IS CALLED Â¿CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE.Â¿ CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS A TIGHTENING OF THE SCAR TISSUE (ALSO CALLED A CAPSULE) THAT NORMALLY FORMS AROUND THE BREAST IMPLANT DURING THE HEALING PROCESS AFTER SURGERY. IN SOME WOMEN, THE SCAR TISSUE (CAPSULE) SQUEEZES THE IMPLANT. THIS RESULTS IN FIRMNESS OR HARDENING OF THE BREAST, AND IT IS A RISK FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE. DEGREES OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE ARE CLASSIFIED BY THE BAKER GRADING SCALE.1 CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BAKER GRADES III AND IV ARE THE MOST SEVERE. BAKER GRADE III OFTEN RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SURGERY (REOPERATION) BECAUSE OF PAIN AND POSSIBLY ABNORMAL APPEARANCE. BAKER GRADE IV USUALLY RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR REOPERATION BECAUSE OF PAIN AND UNACCEPTABLE APPEARANCE. OTHER REASONS FOR REOPERATIONS ARE DISCUSSED IN THE ONLINE PATIENT LABELING IN SECTION 5.5 ALLERGANÂ¿S CLINICAL STUDY RESULTS: WHAT ARE THE MAIN REASONS FOR REOPERATION? GLOSSARY: CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE - A TIGHTENING OF THE SCAR TISSUE (ALSO CALLED A CAPSULE) THAT NORMALLY FORMS AROUND THE BREAST IMPLANT DURING THE HEALING PROCESS AFTER SURGERY. IN SOME WOMEN, THE SCAR TISSUE (CAPSULE) SQUEEZES THE IMPLANT. WHEN THIS OCCURS, IT IS CALLED CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. THIS RESULTS IN FIRMNESS OR HARDENING OF THE BREAST, AND IS A RISK FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS CLASSIFIED BY BAKER GRADES. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BAKER GRADES III AND IV ARE THE MOST SEVERE. BAKER GRADE III OFTEN RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SURGERY (REOPERATION) BECAUSE OF PAIN AND POSSIBLY ABNORMAL APPEARANCE. BAKER GRADE IV USUALLY RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SURGERY (REOPERATION) BECAUSE OF PAIN AND UNACCEPTABLE APPEARANCE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BAKER GRADE II MAY ALSO RESULT IN THE NEED FOR SURGERY. EACH GRADE IS DESCRIBED BELOW. BAKER GRADE I Â¿ NORMALLY SOFT AND NATURAL APPEARANCE. BAKER GRADE II Â¿ A LITTLE FIRM, BUT BREAST LOOKS NORMAL. BAKER GRADE III Â¿ MORE FIRM THAN NORMAL, AND MAY LOOK ABNORMAL (CHANGE IN SHAPE). BAKER GRADE IV Â¿ HARD, OBVIOUS DISTORTION, AND RUPTURE - A HOLE OR TEAR IN THE SHELL OF THE IMPLANT THAT ALLOWS SILICONE GEL FILLER MATERIAL TO LEAK FROM THE SHELL. RUPTURES CAN BE INTRACAPSULAR (INSIDE THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT) OR EXTRACAPSULAR (OUTSIDE THE SCAR TISSUE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT). WARNINGS: RUPTURE OF A SILICONE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT IS MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR SURGEON WILL KNOW THAT YOUR IMPLANTS HAVE A RUPTURE. THEREFORE YOU WILL NEED REGULAR MRI SCREENINGS OVER YOUR LIFETIME IN ORDER TO DETERMINE IF RUPTURE IS PRESENT. YOU SHOULD HAVE AN MRI 3 YEARS AFTER YOUR BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY AND THEN EVERY 2 YEARS AFTER THAT FOR AS LONG AS YOU HAVE YOUR BREAST IMPLANTS. IF IMPLANT RUPTURE IS NOTED ON AN MRI, YOU SHOULD HAVE THE IMPLANT REMOVED, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT.|STYLE 45 SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|45-550|07/27/2017||||N|R||0HP|FTR|1.0|04/22/2011|PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||1266902|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

IT WAS ONLY A FEW WEEKS AGO THAT RPTR WAS ABLE TO CONFIRM 16 YEARS OF ILLNESS DUE TO THESE IMPLANTS. IN SIXTEEN YEARS NOT ONE DR EVER TOLD HER THAT IMPLANTS COULD BE CAUSING SYMPTOMS OF MUSCLE PAIN, ELEVATED LIVER COUNTS, JOINT PAIN AND STIFFNESS, SORE LYMPH NODES, PULMONARY IRREGULARITIES, WEAKNESS AND FATIGUE, HEADACHES, RASH, PHOTOSENSITIVITY, NUMBNESS IN LEG AND BACK, LOW GRADE FEVERS, AND DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY OVER MEMORY PROBLEMS. ALL OF THESE SYMPTOMS CAN BE TRACED THROUGH RPTR'S MEDICAL RECORD GOING BACK TO 1978. THE ONLY PUBLIC RECOGNITION OF THESE SYMPTOMS HAS BEEN RELATED TO THE LEAKING OF GEL IMPLANTS. THE SILICONE SACKS CAUSE JUST AS MUCH OF A PROBLEM. IN 1985 RPTR HAD A FULL BLOWN AUTOIMMUNE RESPONSE WITH EVERY SYMPTOM MENTIONED EARLIER IN THIS LETTER. RPTR LOST OVER A YEAR OF HER LIFE. SHE COULDN'T TAKE CARE OF HER SMALL CHILDREN OR GET OUT OF BED FOR MORE THAN A SHORT TIME. SHE WENT TO MORE THAN EIGHT DRS THAT YEAR ALONE. MOST BLOOD SAMPLES WERE WITHIN NORMAL RANGE. THE SYMPTOMS PERSISTED OFF AND ON FOR YEARS. AND TO THIS DAY RPTR HAS LEARNED TO LIVE WITH THEM. IT HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS SHOCK FOR RPTR TO REALIZE AFTER READING CASE STUDIES OF WOMEN WITH NOT ONLY GEL-FILLED BUT ALSO SALINE-FILLED IMPLANTS THAT THEIR SYMPTOMS ARE JUST LIKE HERS. RPTR WAS NEVER TOLD, EVEN AFTER FIVE MAMMOGRAMS, THAT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETECT ALL CANCERS WITH THIS TEST. DR NEVER TOLD HER THE MAMMOGRAM REPORTS STATED A CONTAINED RUPTURE.

SHE WAS HUGGING HER HUSBAND IN SPRING 1985 WHEN SHE FELT A POP AT HER LEFT BREAST. SHE ASSUMED IT WAS THE SCAR TISSUE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT THAT RELEASD BECAUSE SHE WAS TOLD THEY WOULD NOT RUPTURE FROM EVERYDAY SITUATIONS. THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN THE BREAST AND SHE SOON FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT. IT CAME TO HER ATTENTION YEARS LATER THAT IMPLANTS WERE RUPTURING AND SHE STARTED TO SUSPECT IT AS A CAUSE FOR HER FAILING HEALTH. IN THE SAME TIME FRAME AS THE ""POP"", SHE STARTED WITH SUDDEN UNEXPLAINED COMPLETE AND TOTAL NUMBNESS IN BOTH ARMS AND HANDS DURING THE NIGHT AND ""PINS AND NEEDLES"" DURING THE DAY. SHE ALSO STARTED TO GET STABBING PAINS IN THE AREA OF THE OUTER CORNER OF HER LEFT EYE. OVER TIME IT DEVELOPED INTO A ""HEADACHE THAT WAS CONSTANT, DAY AND NIGHT FOR EIGHT YEARS. FOR ALL THOSE YEARS SHE NEVER GOT A FULL NIGHTS SLEEP SO SHE DID NOT KNOW IF THE FATIGUE WAS ALSO A SYMPTOM OR A RESULT OF THE LACK OF SLEEP. THE TOTAL NUMBNESS OF HER ARMS AND HANDS HAS SUBSIDED BUT NOW SHE HAS MORE PINS AND NEEDLES, PAIN AND BURNING PAIN. THEY WILL GO COMPLETELY NUMB ON OCCASION, MOSTLY DURING SLEEP.

OPERATIVE REPORT; JULY 30, 1993. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: BILATERAL BREAST PAIN, BILATERAL CHANGE IN BREAST SHAPE, BILATERAL CHANGE IN BREAST SIZE, FOREIGN BODY MASTITIS, RETAINED FOREIGN BODY MATERIAL, FOREIGN BODY GRANULOMA. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: SAME, WITH CONFIRMATION OF BILATERAL RUPTURED MAMMARY PROSTHESIS WITH INTRACAPSULAR EXTRAVASATION. OPERATION PERFORMED: BILATERAL BREAST EXPLORATION, EXCISION OF FOREIGN BODY GRANULOMA, TOTAL CAPSULECTOMY AND MODIFIED SUPERIOR PEDICLE RECONSTRUCTION. INTEGUMENT WAS REMOVED ACCORDINGLY AND NIPPLE AREOLA COMPLEX ISOLATED. A PERICAPSULAR DISSECTION WAS PERFORMED WITH LEFT PROSTHESIS FIRST AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO DISSECTION IN AXILLARY AREA WITH PROSTHESIS IN CAPSULE. THEREFORE, CAPSULE WAS OPENED AND RUPTURED PROSTHESIS WAS REMOVED. TOTAL CAPSULECTOMY WAS COMPLETED IN AXILLARY AREA AND BLEEDING WAS CONTROLLED WITH ELECTROCAUTERY. THERE WAS NO VASCULAR DISTRESS. AT THIS POINT IN SURGERY, EXACT SAME PROCEDURE WAS CARRIED OUT ON OPPOSITE SIDE WITH IDENTICAL PERICAPSULAR DISSECTION WITH REMOVAL OF PROSTHESIS IN ORDER TO FACILITATE DISSECTION. RIGHT PROSTHESIS WAS REMOVED IN TACT. THERE WERE NO VISIBLE OR PALPABLE STRANDS ON PROSTHESIS OR INTRACAPSULAR AREA. PATHOLOGY REPORT: SUBMITTED IS A POUCH OF MEMBRANE WHICH IS OPENED AND MEASURES APPROX 15 X 8 X 0.5 CM. THERE IS NO OBVIOUS NODULARITY. ONE SURFACE IS SMOOTH AND OTHER HAS ATTACHED BITS OF REDDISH TISSUE. ""R.P.E."", ONE CASSETTE. SUBMITTED IS A FIBROUS CAPSULE WHICH IS OPENED FULLY. ONE PORTION MEASURES APPROX 9.5 X 9 X 0.1 CM & THERE IS A TAIL WHICH MEASURES APPROX 12 X 4 X 0.1 CM. ONE SURFACE APPEARS SMOOTH AND OTHER HAS ATTACHED BITS OF REDDISH TISSUE. ""R.P.E."", ONE CASSETTE. THESE SECTIONS SHOW FIBROUS MEMBRANE WITH UNDERLYING STRIATED MUSCLE AND FATTY TISSUE. THERE IS SOME MINOR CHRONIC INFLAMMATION IN STRIATED MUSCLE. MEMBRANE ITSELF IS COMPOSED OF DENSE HYALINIZED COLLAGEN. NEAR ONE EDGE THERE ARE SOME VACUOLES SURROUNDING HISTIOCYTES CONSISTENT WITH SILICONE GRANULOMA AND IN ANOTHER ZONE THERE ARE MANY FOAMY HISTIOCYTES AND NEARBY VACUOLES CONSISTENT WITH SILICONE GRANULOMA. DIAGNOSES: 1. HYALINE FIBROUS MEMBRANE, SHOWING FOCI OF SILICONE GRANULOMAS FROM RIGHT BREAST. 2. HYALINE FIBROUS MEMBRANE, SHOWING FOCI OF SILICONE GRANULOMAS FROM LEFT BREAST. DR'S DICTATION: REMOVAL DATE IS 7/30/93. TWO IMPLANTS ARE RECOVERED WITH TWO VERY SMALL TISSUE SAMPLES AND TWO LARGER CONTAINERS OF TISSUE LABELED APPROPRIATELY RIGHT AND LEFT. SUPPLEMENTARY TISSUE FROM CAPSULE APPEARS TO BE SAMPLED FROM MAJOR CONTAINER BUT IT IS REPACKAGED IN VERY SMALL 10 CC CONTAINERS. WHOLE SERIES OF SPECIMEN IS CONTAINED WITHIN SELFSEAL PLASTIC BAGS. PROSTHESES ARE IDENTIFIED AS SURGITEK SCL TYPE. THESE BEAR THE INSCRIPTION SCL 300 ON SHELL AND THEY HAVE A GLUED ELASTOMER NUMBER ON THE INSIDE INDICATING 300 CCS AS WELL. RIGHT IMPLANT HAS A LARGE EQUATORIAL PLEAT AND PLEAT SHOWS MATERIAL UPSET AT SEVERAL POINTS WITHIN PLEAT LINE WITH PREFERENTIAL LOSS OF OIL. THERE ARE ADDITIONAL AREAS WHERE SHELL IS DEGRADED CONSISTENTLY WITH DEVICES MADE ACCORDING TO SAME PROCESS. GEL IS MEDIUM YELLOW AND SHELL IS ADHESIVE WITH RESPECT TO POLYETHYLENE AND WITH RESPECT TO SEVERAL OTHER PLASTICS, THEREFORE, CONFIRMING LOSS OF BARRIER PROPERTIES DUE TO SWELLING OF OUTER POLYMER LAYER. GEL IS NOT GROSSLY CONTAMINATED. LEFT IMPLANT IS RECOVERED IN A PERFORATED STATE. THERE ARE MULTIPLE PERFORATIONS ON PLEATS ON EQUATOR, LARGEST MEASURING APPROX ONE CM IN WIDTH AND IT IS COINCIDENT WITH A PROMINENT PLEAT. THERE ARE ADDITIONAL MINOR PERFORATIONS ON EQUIVALENT PLEAT LINES, GEL IS BRIGHT YELLOW AND HAS INTERNAL TURBIDITY PREFERENTIALLY AT SITE OF PERFORATIONS. THERE IS AIR SPACE IN IMPLANT. THERE ARE ADDITIONAL PLEAT LINES ON EQUATOR WITH STILL MORE MINOR PERFORATIONS. IN SUMMARY, IMPLANT HAS REACHED END OF ITS USEFUL LIFE, IT IS MULTIPLY PERFORATED ALONG NATURAL PLEAT LINES WHICH ARE AT EXPECTED SITE. THE COUNTERPART IMPLANT, THE ONE ON RIGHT, SHOWS PRECURSOR SIGNS OF THE SAME EVENTS HAPPENING AND THERE ARE ADDITIONAL FEATURES SUGGESTING ERRORS IN CONSTRUCTION FOR BOTH DEVICES. ON LEFT SIDE, PATCH HAS MISSING PORTIONS OF THE EDGE. ON THE RIGHT SIDE THE PATCH LAP SHOWS MULTIPLE DOUBLES ON EDGE AND AS SUCH THE PRODUCT DEVIATES FROM THE QUALITY ASSURANCE SPECIFICATIONS. THE SURFACE HAS AN UNUSUAL POWDERY FEEL TYPICAL OF THE SCL WITH ONSET OF SHELL DEGRADATION."|SURGITEK MAMMARY IMPLANT, 300CC|15913000S0|02/05/1999|V||*|Y||204045.0|0LP|FTR|2.0||MAMMARY IMPLANT|Y|05157-86L|2317 EATON LANE||RACINE|US|MEDICAL ENGINEERING CORP.

ON 2/6/95, PRODUCT EVALUATION RECEIVED A TELEPHONE CALL REPORTING THE PT'S INFO. THE COMPLAINT WAS DEFLATION OF THE RIGHT DEVICE AND AUTO-IMMUNE TYPE SYMPTOMS. ON 4/2/91, DR IMPLANTED A SMOOTH SALINE-FILLED MAMMARY PROSTHESIS (CATALOG NO 350-1650, LOT NO 25760) SUBMUSCULARLY AS PART OF A BILATERAL AUGMENTATION. AT IMPLANTATION, THE DEVICE WAS FILLED WITH 425 CC OF SALINE (RECOMMENDED FILL VOLUME IS 325 + 50 CC). ON 2/2/95, THE PT REPORTEDLY EXPERIENCED A ""DEFLATION"" OF THE RIGHT DEVICE. ON 2/20/95, BOTH DEVICES WERE EXPLANTED. ON 10/27/95, THE PT REPORTED THAT SHE WAS EXPERIENCING NUMEROUS HEALTH PROBLEMS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: OSTEOARTHRITIS, FYBROMYALGIA, RAYNAUD'S PNEUMONION, SCLERODERMA, AND DEGENERATIVE DISC DISEASE. THE PT REPORTEDLY HAS NOT SEEN HER DR SINCE HER SUTURES WERE REMOVED. ONE SMOOTH SALINE-FILLED MAMMARY PROSTHESIS WITH DIAPHRAGM VALVE (CATALOG NUMBER 350-1650, LOT NUMBER 25760) WAS RETURNED TO MENTOR H/S FOR PRODUCT EVALUATION. AS RECEIVED, THE DEVICE APPEARED TO BE INTACT WITH THE FILL TUBE INSERTED INTO THE DIAPHRAGM VALVE. THERE WAS A TRACE AMOUNT OF UNK CLEAR FLUID INSIDE THE DEVICE. AN UNK WHITE SUBSTANCE WAS ON THE ANTERIOR SIDE OF THE DEVICE. ON THE POSTERIOR SIDE OF THE DEVICE WAS AN UNK BROWN SUBSTANCE. AN UNK GREEN SUBSTANCE WAS ON THE DIAPHRAGM VALVE AND THE FILL TUBE. NO OTHER ANOMALIES WERE OBSERVED. BECAUSE THE PT IS CONSIDERED PART OF THE CLASS ACTION, PRODUCT EVALUATION WAS PRECLUDED FROM PERFORMING A LEAK TESTING OR PERFORMING A MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION ON THE DEVICE. BASED ON THE LIMITED PRODUCT EVALUATION, THE DEVICE APPEARED INTACT. PRODUCT EVALUATION WAS UNABLE TO CONFIRM THE REPORTED DEFLATION OF THE RIGHT DEVICE. WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF FURTHER INVESTIGATION TO INCLUDE LEAK TESTING AND A MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION OF THE DEVICE, PRODUCT EVALUATION WAS UNABLE TO IDENTIFY ANY LEAKAGE SITES WHICH MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTED DEFLATION OF THE DEVICE. BECAUSE OF THE CLASS ACTION AND CONCERNS OF POSSIBLE SPOLIATION OF EVIDENCE, MENTOR H/S IS PROHIBITED FROM CONDUCTING PHYSICIAL EVALUATION OF THE COVERED DEVICE. WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF ADD'L INVESTIGATION, NO FURTHER CONCLUSION CAN BE MADE AT THIS TIME.

280331|191820|D|1||"I HAD COMPLICATIONS IMMEDIATELY. I HAD TO HAVE 2 ADD'L SURGERIES TO CORRECT THE COMPLICATIONS. THEY HARDENED, MOVED IN MY CHEST CAVITY, AND THEY LEAKED. I STARTED TO ITCH IMMEDIATELY, AND BECAME ALLERGIC TO MANY THINGS. MY BODY FELT FATIGUED, I HAD MIGRAINE HEADACHES, AND COULDN'T SLEEP. I BEGAN TO ACHE ALL OVER, HAD PANIC ATTACKS, MY VISION CHANGED RAPIDLY. I KEPT REPORTING VARIOUS COMPLAINTS TO MY PHYSICIANS, NO ONE COULD HELP ME, EVEN THOUGH THEY KEPT TRYING. I BECAME DEPRESSED, MY WHOLE BODY BEGAN TO CHANGE, MY BREASTS WERE ITCHING DEEP INSIDE, WERE COMPLETELY NUMB. THEY WERE HOT TO TOUCH, AND PAINFUL, I WAS TOLD IT WOULD GO AWAY. THE SYMPTOMS PROGRESSED RAPIDLY, EACH TIME THEY WENT BACK IN, THEY USED THE SAME IMPLANTS, EVEN REFILLED THE ONE THAT LEAKED. MY MAMMOGRAMS SHOWED A BULGE, THE RADIOLOGIST ADVISED ME TO REMOVE THEM, THE PLASTIC SURGEON DENIED WHAT THE FILM SHOWED. I HAD A SONOGRAM LATER, AND IT SHOWED MY LYMPH NODES WERE SWOLLEN. THEY IDENTIFIED GEL OUTSIDE OF THE CAPSULES. MY HEALTH WAS DECLINING RAPIDLY. THE NURSES TOLD ME ABOUT THE ADVERSE EFFECTS, TWO MONTHS BEFORE THIS LITIGATION WAS TO CLOSE. I HAD TO SEE AN INTERNAL SPECIALIST, WHO DIAGNOSED ME WITH SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS, SO DID A RHEUMATOLOGIST, AND SO DID A NEUROLOGIST. I HAVE SEIZURES, CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDER, ATYPICAL LUPUS, SJOGREN'S, RAYNAUD'S, NUMEROUS OTHER CONDITIONS. I HAVE BEEN HOSPITALIZED, GONE TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM, STAYED HOME BECAUSE I AM NOW UNEMPLOYABLE. NO ONE WILL INSURE ME NOW, AND THIS IS A PARTIAL LIST OF MY SYMPTOMS, AND DISORDERS. I AM POSITIVE MY PATHOLOGIST'S REPORT SHOWED A HOLE IN MY IMPLANT. MY VISION IS VERY IMPAIRED NOW. I CAN'T GET OUT OF BED, WITHOUT HELP, AND I AM CONSTANTLY ILL. I AM IN HORRENDOUS PAIN EACH DAY. MY MEMORY IS IMPAIRED SIGNIFICANTLY. I GET LOST, I CAN'T EVEN SHOP FOR GROCERIES, OR COOK A MEAL NOW. I DON'T GO INTO A DEEP SLEEP PATTERN, MY BRAIN STAYS ON RUN, WHILE MY BODY CRIES IN PAIN. MY LEGS AND FEET STAY SWOLLEN HUGE. MY FINGERS DON'T MOVE, I HAVE CRAMPS IN MY HANDS, LEGS, AND FEET THAT MAKE MY HANDS DRAW INTO GNARLS. I HAVE NIGHT SWEATS, MY FACE IS GETTING A PINK RASH OVER MY NOSE. MY BRAIN HAS ELECTRIC LIGHT SHOWS, AND I WAKE UP EXHAUSTED. MY WHOLE LIFE HAS CHANGED. MY IMMUNE SYSTEM IS COMPROMISED, I CAN'T BE AROUND ANYONE WHO IS ILL, OR I GET ILL. I'M SO ALLERGIC TO ALL CHEMICALS, I HAVE SEVERE REACTIONS TO THEM. MY VOICE HAS CHANGED, MY SPEECH IS SLURRED, I'M NOT ME NOW. MY FACE HAS BROKEN OUT IN BLISTERS, I'M ALLERGIC TO THE SUN, AND I HAVE ASTHMA NOW. I CAN'T BEGIN TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAS HAPPENED. I HAVE SOMEONE TYPING FOR ME, MY BRAIN CAN'T PUT THE WORDS TOGETHER NOW. I HAD NONE OF THESE PROBLEMS BEFORE IMPLANTS. I WAS NEVER TOLD OF THE CHEMICALS IN IMPLANTS. I WAS TOLD THAT IT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER TO DETECT BREAST CANCER. I HAD FIBRO-CYSTIC BREAST DISEASE. I AM POSITIVE THE IMPLANTS ARE WHAT HAS CAUSED ME TO BECOME EXTREMELY DISABLED, I AM FORCED TO FILE FOR DISABILITY. I WOULD RATHER BE THE PRODUCTIVE PERSON I WAS BEFORE I HAD SILICONE IMPLANTS. I RARELY AM ABLE TO GO OUT. I CAN'T HOLD MY GRANDBABIES OR PARTICIPATE IN A NORMAL LIFE. I AM SEXUALLY NOT A LADY NOW. I CAN'T HAVE A CLIMAX, MY VAGINA IS SO DRY, AND PAINFUL. WHY DID THE FDA ALLOW THIS? I THOUGHT IMPLANTS WERE SAFE, AND HAD BEEN APPROVED. NOW I'M READING I'VE BEEN TOXICALLY POISONED. I TRY TO USE MY MIND TO CONTROL PAIN. I AM ILL, I WANT TO BE WELL, I WANT TO BE FREE FROM ALL OF THE THINGS I HAVE WRONG WITH ME NOW. I TRY SO HARD, BUT I CAN'T DO THINGS. I WILL NEVER GIVE UP TRYING. I WISH I WAS WELL ENOUGH TO BE ME AGAIN NOW. I STAY AWAY FROM THE DOCTORS, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY MORE. I CAN'T HEAR WELL, AND I'M SO TIRED. I DON'T LEAD A NORMAL LIFE. I'M SICK, AND I'M JUST TRYING TO HIDE FROM ANY MORE TESTS, OR HOSPS. THESE CHEST PAINS WERE NEVER NORMAL FOR A 35 YEAR OLD LADY WHO EXERCIZED, WAS PHYSICALLY IN SHAPE. NOW I CAN'T RAISE MY ARMS, THE PAIN GOES FROM MY BREAST CLEAR DOWN TO MY FINGERTIPS. I CAN'T TELL YOU ANY MORE, IT'S TOO UPSETTING TO LOOK AT. I HAD A HYSTERECTOMY, I HEMORRHAGED FOR MONTHS. I'VE HAD A KIDNEY STONE, MY BLADDER IS BLOCKED, INFECTED ALL THE TIME, AND THEY CAN'T DO SURGERY. I HAVE A YEAST INFECTION CONTINUALLY. MY NAILS HAVE HAD A FUNGUS. MY SKIN HAS HUGE BLOOD PLACES THE SIZE OF A MAN'S HAND, ON MY FOREARMS ALWAYS, MY SKIN IS LIKE TISSUE PAPER. I FREEZE WHEN IT IS 90 DEGREES. SINUS, OH I COULD JUST KEEP GOING ON, AND ON BUT I WON'T. I THINK YOU HAVE READ ENOUGH. I'M BACK IN KINDERGARTEN, AND I WAS INTELLIGENT ONCE.

I SOON BEGAN EXPERIENCING UNEXPLAINED ILLNESSES AND SYMPTOMS THAT COULD NOT BE DIAGNOSED. IN 1993, I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH SLE LUPUS AND SIGNED WITH THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT. MY MEDICAL RECORDS WERE NEVER GIVEN TO ME AND MY DR HAD FILED THE COUNTRY WITH HIS MEDICAL RECORDS. I WAS ABLE TO LOCATE SOME OF MY RECORDS THROUGH THE NOW DEFUNCT SURGICAL CENTER BUT IT LISTED THE IMPLANTS ONLY AS 200CC SILASTIC PROSTHESIS. DOW REFUSED TO DEAL WITH ME UNLESS I WAS EXPLANTED. IN 2006, I WAS EXPLANTED, IMAGINE MY SURPRISE WHEN THE IMPLANTS READ DEPUY 200CC. I WAS SHOCKED, THESE WERE NOT THE IMPLANTS SHOWN TO ME IN THE DR'S OFFICE PRIOR TO SURGERY. I BEGAN TO RESEARCH AND CONTACTED ANOTHER DR IMMEDIATELY TO SEE IF HE HAD HEARD OF THESE IMPLANTS. I ALSO CALLED DEPUY IN WARSAW, INDIANA -DOING BUSINESS THERE SINCE 1895, NOW A JOHNSON & JOHNSON CO. DEPUY TOLD ME THEY NEVER MADE BREAST IMPLANTS. I TOLD THEM I HAD JUST BEEN EXPLANTED WITH THEIR IMPLANTS AND KEPT THEM AS PROOF. AN HOUR LATER THE DEPUY LEGAL DEPT CALLED ME BACK AND TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD MADE BREAST IMPLANTS IN THE 1970-1980'S AND BASICALLY TO GO POUND SAND. DR REFERRED ME TO A THIRD DR. HERE IS WHAT I LEARNED FROM HIM. A DOW EMPLOYEE, DECEASED, DESIGNED THE DEPUY BREAST IMPLANTS. THE IMPLANTS WERE TO BE INVESTIGATIONAL AND WERE MADE WITH DOW SILICONE. DOW IS AWARE OF THIS AS PER DEPOSTION #MDL 926. THESE WERE EXPERIMENTAL AND WERE IMPLANTED IN ME WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT. I WAS UNWITTINGLY USED AS A HUMAN GUINEA PIG BY A TRUSTED MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL AND 2 LARGE CORPORATIONS. I AM SICK, I AM FURIOUS AND MY CLAIM IS STILL BEING DENIED.

1081485|7890580|N|1||BASED ON THE INFO PROVIDED TO MENTOR, A PT EXPERIENCED BILATERAL BAKER GRADE 2 1/2 CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE FOLLOWING BREAST AUGMENTATION WITH SMOOTH SALINE-FILLED MAMMARY PROSTHESES. IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT THE PT EXPERIENCED SYMPTOMS OF FATIGUE AND BRAIN FOG AND SCLERODERMA-TYPE SKIN RASHES. ONE OF THE PT'S EXPLANTED DEVICES WAS RETURNED TO MENTOR FOR EVAL. THE DEVICE WAS FOUND TO BE INTACT WITH NO ANOMALIES. BASED ON THE INFO PROVIDED, PE CONCLUDED THE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IN THE PT'S BREASTS WAS THE RESULT OF THE BODY'S INDIVIDUAL PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE TO THE IMPLANTATION OF A FOREIGN OBJECT IN SOFT TISSUE. THE SEVERITY OF THIS CONDITION VARIES WITH EACH INDIVIDUAL. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE CAN MAKE THE BREAST HARDER AND FIRMER THAN DESIRABLE WHICH MAY RESULT IN BREAST ASYMMETRY, DISCOMFORT OR PAIN. THIS CONDITION HAS ALSO BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH DEVICE DEFLATION, WRINKLING AND/OR DISPLACEMENT OF THE PROSTHESIS. CONCERN OVER THE ASSOCIATION OF BREAST IMPLANTS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF AUTOIMMUNE OR CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASES, SUCH AS LUPUS, SCLERODERMA, OR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, WAS RAISED BECAUSE OF CASES REPORTED IN THE LITERATURE WITH SMALL NUMBERS OF WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS. A REVIEW OF SEVERAL LARGE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF WOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IMPLANTS INDICATES THAT THESE DISEASES ARE NO MORE COMMON IN WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS THAN THOSE IN WOMEN WITHOUT IMPLANTS. BASED ON THESE STUDIES, PE IS UNABLE TO CONFIRM THAT THE REPORTED SYMPTOMS ARE DEVICE RELATED; HOWEVER, MENTOR CONTINUES TO INCLUDE EXTENSIVE DISCUSSIONS ON ALLEGED SILICONE RESPONSES IN ITS PRODUCT INSERT DATA SHEETS SO THAT THE PT AND PHYSICIAN ARE FULLY INFORMED OF ANY POTENTIAL RISKS.

INITIAL CLINICAL PRESENTATION (B)(6) 2010. THIS IS (B)(6) FEMALE WITH A HISTORY OF DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU OF THE LEFT BREAST DIAGNOSED IN 1998. SHE SUBSEQUENTLY UNDERWENT A LEFT MASTECTOMY WHERE THE SPECIMEN WEIGHT WAS 596 GRAMS. SHE UNDERWENT IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION WITH PLACEMENT OF SUBMUSCULAR TISSUE EXPANDER BY PLASTIC SURGEON #1. THE TISSUE EXPANDER WAS PLACED COMPLETELY SUBPECTORAL AND ALSO IN A SUBSERRATUS POCKET. THE EXPANDER WAS REMOVED IN 1999 AND REPLACED WITH A MCGHAN 440 ML DUAL-CHAMBER SILICONE AND SALINE-FILLED IMPLANT. SHE RECEIVED NO POSTOPERATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY OR RADIATION THERAPY. WITHIN A YEAR, SHE DEVELOPED SIGNIFICANT HARDENING AND DISTORTION OF THE LEFT RECONSTRUCTED BREAST WITH GRADUAL ELEVATION OF THE IMPLANT, TIGHTENING OF THE TISSUE AROUND THE IMPLANT, AND DISCOMFORT IN THE LEFT CHEST WALL. SHE WAS SEEN IN EVALUATION IN 2006 BY PLASTIC SURGEON #2, WHO RE-OPERATED ON HER LEFT BREAST AND REMOVED THE EXISTING IMPLANT, PERFORMED PERIPROSTHETIC CAPSULOTOMIES WHICH WERE NOT SPECIFIED IN THE OPERATIVE NOTE, SUBMITTED CAPSULAR TISSUE FOR HISTOLOGIC EXAMINATION (INTERPRETED AS NEGATIVE) AND REPLACED A SMALLER SALINE IMPLANT. THIS WAS AN ALLERGAN-STYLE 68MP SALINE IMPLANT, SIZE 390-420 ML. THIS RECONSTRUCTION WAS SOFT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, BUT WITHIN 1 YEAR, SHE HAD RECURRENCE OF THE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE WITH TIGHTENING OF THE TISSUE AROUND THE IMPLANT, GRADUAL ELEVATION OF THE IMPLANT LOCATION, AND DISCOMFORT IN THE LEFT CHEST WALL. SHE WAS SEEN IN EVALUATION IN 2009 BY PLASTIC SURGEON #4 WHO RECOMMENDED THAT SHE CONSIDER REVISION OF HER RECONSTRUCTION WITH THE ADDITION OF AN CELLULAR DERMAL MATRIX TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR RECURRENCE OF HER CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE AROUND THE DEVICE. PLASTIC SURGEON #4 ALSO RECOMMENDED AUTOLOGOUS ABDOMINAL FLAP RECONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES. THE PT WAS INTERESTED IN CONSIDERING A DIEP FLAP AND PLASTIC SURGEON #4 REFERRED HER TO ME ((B)(6) SURGEON #5) FOR EVALUATION AND CONSIDERATION OF A FREE FLAP BREAST RECONSTRUCTION PROCEDURE. THE PT'S PAST MEDICAL HISTORY WAS ADDITIONALLY SIGNIFICANT FOR A HISTORY OF HYPOTHYROIDISM AND BLADDER PROLAPSE. HER MEDICATIONS INCLUDED SYNTHROID 88 MCG DAILY, VITAMIN D, AND ADVIL. SHE IS A NONSMOKER AND DRINKS ALCOHOL RARELY. INITIAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION, (B)(6) 2010, SHOWED THE PT WAS 155 CM TALL, 70.3 KG. THE LEFT BREAST WAS ABSENT THROUGH A TRANSVERSE STEWART-TYPE MASTECTOMY INCISION. THERE WAS AN IMPLANT PRESENT IN THE SUBPECTORAL POSITION ON THE LEFT SIDE. THERE WAS A BAKER GRADE IV CAPSULE CONTRACTURE AROUND THIS DEVICE, WHICH WAS RIGIDLY AFFIXED TO HER CHEST WALL AND SOMEWHAT TENDER TO MANIPULATION. THE WOUNDS WERE WELL HEALED WITH NO EVIDENCE OF SCAR HYPERTROPHY. THE RIGHT BREAST WAS MORE PTOTIC WITH A DEGREE OF PSEUDOPTOSIS, LATERAL BOTTOMING OUT AND A WISE-PATTERN SCAR FROM PREVIOUS MASTOPEXY - RESULTING IN SUBSTANTIAL SHAPE AND VOLUME ASYMMETRY. ON THE LEFT SIDE, THE STERNAL NOTCH TO INFRAMAMMARY FOLD DISTANCE WAS 20 CM. ON THE RIGHT SIDE, THE STERNAL NOTCH TO INFRAMAMMARY FOLD DISTANCE WAS 23 CM. THE MID-CLAVICULAR POINT TO NIPPLE DISTANCE ON THE RIGHT WAS 21 CM. EXAMINATION OF THE ABDOMEN SHOWED A GENEROUS AMOUNT OF TISSUE IN THE LOWER 1/3 OF THE ABDOMEN FOR ABDOMINAL FLAP CONSIDERATION. INITIAL IMPRESSION, (B)(6) 2010. THIS WAS A (B)(6) FEMALE WITH RECURRENT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE FOLLOWING 2 PREVIOUS IMPLANT-BASED RECONSTRUCTION SURGERIES ON THE LEFT SIDE. THE LEFT BREAST RECONSTRUCTION SHOWED ELEVATION OF THE INFRAMAMMARY FOLD AND A SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE AROUND THE EXISTING IMPLANT. I RECOMMENDED REMOVAL OF THE EXISTING LEFT BREAST IMPLANT, RECONSTRUCTION OF THE ORIGINS OF THE LEFT PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE AND RECONSTRUCTION OF THE LEFT BREAST WITH A FREE ABDOMINAL FLAP. OPERATIVE FINDINGS ON (B)(6) 2011: THE LEFT BREAST IMPLANT CAPSULE WAS OPENED AND CONTAINED A CLOUDY YELLOW FLUID UNDER ENORMOUS PRESSURE, THE FLUID SQUIRTED OUT OF THE CAPSULAR INCISION AND TRAVELED AT LEAST 56 INCHES. THERE WAS A COLLECTION OF GELATINOUS MATERIAL WITHIN THE CAPSULE AS WELL AS AN INTACT SALINE BREAST IMPLANT. THE CAPSULE WAS THICKENED AND COVERED WITH PLAQUE-LIKE LESIONS INTERNALLY. A TOTAL CAPSULECTOMY WAS PERFORMED, THE PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE WAS REATTACHED TO ITS 5TH RIB ORIGINS. THE PERIPROSTHETIC FLUID WAS CAPTURED, AND ALL MATERIAL WAS SENT FOR PATHOLOGIC AND CYTOLOGIC EVALUATION INCLUDING FROZEN SECTION WHICH WAS CONSISTENT WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF ALCL. THE REMAINING RECONSTRUCTION WAS ABANDONED PENDING FINAL PATHOLOGY EVALUATION SPECIMEN. DETAILED PATHOLOGY FINDINGS: LEFT BREAST PERI-PROSTHETIC MATERIAL.

2264070|2198895|D|1||"(B)(6), 2011. RE: BREAST IMPLANT RUPTURE ((B)(6)-2011) - (B)(6). (B)(6). I HAD MENTOR BREAST IMPLANTS ON (B)(6)-2002 BY DR. (B)(6). AROUND (B)(6) 2011, I NOTICED THAT MY RIGHT BREAST SEEMED TO BE GETTING SMALLER. THEN ON (B)(6)-2011, I BEGAN TO HAVE PAIN AND COULD FEEL LUMPS IN THE RIGHT BREAST, SO I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH DR. (B)(6) FOR THE NEXT DAY (B)(6)-2011. ON THAT DAY DR. (B)(6) AFTER EXAMINATION SCHEDULED ME FOR A 7:00AM OPERATION ON SATURDAY (B)(6)-2011 BECAUSE THE RIGHT BREAST WAS RUPTURED AND HE WAS VERY CONCERNED. DR. (B)(6) FELT THE URGENCY TO PERFORM THE OPERATION ONLY 2 DAYS AFTER INITIAL VISIT (PLEASE NOTE: HIS CONCERN WAS URGENT ENOUGH THAT HE PERFORMED THE SURGERY ON SATURDAY WHEN THE OPERATING ROOM IS NOT NORMALLY IN USE). DUE TO THE SEVERITY OF THE RUPTURE, I DID NOT HAVE TIME TO CONTACT DR. (B)(6) TO CONFIRM WHAT TYPE IMPLANTS HE INITIALLY INSTALLED. WHEN DR. (B)(6) OPENED MY CHEST CAVITY TO VIEW THE IMPLANT, HE STATED IN HIS REPORT THAT THERE WAS NO MANUFACTURER NAME NOR SERIAL NUMBER ON THE IMPLANT. THEREFORE, DR. (B)(6) IMPLANTED WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE CLOSEST TO PRODUCT CURRENTLY USED. HAD WE KNOWN THE PRODUCT WAS MENTOR AND HAD WE BEEN GIVEN ANY WARRANTY INFORMATION FROM DR. (B)(6), WE CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE USED MENTOR PRODUCTS FOR REPLACEMENT. NO WARRANTY INFORMATION WAS GIVEN TO US OR EVEN MENTIONED TO CHECK THE MENTOR WEBSITE BY DR. (B)(6). I HAD NO IDEA THAT BREAST IMPLANTS OFFERED LIMITED WARRANTIES UNTIL DR. (B)(6) MENTIONED THAT I SHOULD CONTACT MENTOR TO GET MY WARRANTIED PRODUCT CLAIM STARTED. PLEASE NOTE REPORT OF OPERATION FROM DR. (B)(6) WAS FAXED TO ME ON (B)(6)-2011. DR. (B)(6) RECORDED THE FOLLOWING IN HIS NOTES: RUPTURED RIGHT BREAST IMPLANT WITH SEVERE CALCIFICATION OF RIGHT BREAST CAPSULE, WHICH WAS REMOVED. LEFT BREAST WAS ALSO REMOVED AND REPLACED, AND IT WAS NOTED THAT IT WAS A 275CC IMPLANT FILLED TO 301CC, AND NEITHER IMPLANT HAD A SERIAL NUMBER. DUE TO THE RUPTURING OF THE IMPLANT AND THE CALCIFICATION ON THE RIGHT BREAST, I AM CONCERNED ABOUT MY FUTURE HEALTH AND MEDICAL ISSUES FROM THE RUPTURED IMPLANT. IN ADDITION, I AM VERY CONCERNED BY THE FACT THAT NO MANUFACTURER NAME OR SERIAL NUMBER WAS ON EITHER IMPLANT, AS I NOW UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS THE INFORMATION UTILIZED FOR RECALL PURPOSES. I HAVE CONSULTED YOUR MENTOR WEBSITE WARRANTY INFORMATION, WHICH STATES, ""THE FIRST BREAST IMPLANT MANUFACTURER IN THE INDUSTRY TO OFFER A LIMITED WARRANTY ON ALL OUR BREAST IMPLANTS,"" AND FURTHER STATES, ""ALL MENTOR BREAST IMPLANTS COME WITH A FREE, LIMITED WARRANTY PROGRAM THAT OFFERS LIFETIME PRODUCT REPLACEMENT AND LIMITED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IF NEEDED. BECAUSE YOUR PEACE OF MIND COMES FIRST."" I HAVE ALSO CONSULTED THE WEBSITE OF DR. (B)(6) FROM THE (B)(6). THE WEBSITE HAS A BREAST IMPLANT OFFER FOR (B)(6) 2011. HIS PARTICULAR AD STATES IN PART, ""MANUFACTURERS (MENTOR AND ALLERGAN) OFFER A LIFETIME WARRANTY ON THEIR IMPLANTS IN THE EVENT OF IMPLANT RUPTURE. AND, IF THE RUPTURE OCCURS WITHIN THE FIRST 10 YEARS OF IMPLANTATION, BOTH (MENTOR AND ALLERGAN) OFFER A FINANCIAL WARRANTY OF (B)(6)."" WHEN I SPOKE TO A MENTOR REPRESENTATIVE ON THE PHONE SHORTLY AFTER MY RETURN HOME FROM SURGERY, I WAS TOLD MY SPECIFIC IMPLANTS HAD NO WARRANTY. I QUESTIONED WHY THERE WERE NO SERIAL NUMBERS OR THE MENTOR BRAND NAME ON EITHER IMPLANT, AND ASKED THE REPRESENTATIVE, ""ISN'T THIS INFORMATION NEEDED AND USED FOR RECALLS?"" SHE ABRUPTLY INFORMED ME, ""THAT THE IMPLANTS IN QUESTION HAD NEVER HAD A RECALL."" OTHER THAN THE YEAR AND DATE OF INSTALLATION ((B)(6)-2002) THE REPRESENTATIVE HAD NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO REFERENCE WHETHER THERE HAD BEEN A RECALL MADE ON THIS IMPLANT PRODUCT. I AM REQUESTING THAT MENTOR DO THE FOLLOWING TO HONOR THEIR WRITTEN, STATED WARRANTY. REIMBURSE ME THE COST OF THE IMPLANTS SINCE THERE WAS NO BRAND DESCRIPTION OR SERIAL NUMBER ON THE ORIGINAL PRODUCT AND SINCE THE URGENCY OF THE RUPTURE LEFT NO TIME FOR ME TO CONTACT THE ORIGINAL PHYSICIAN, DR.

2674277|16325445|N|1||"A REPORT WAS MADE TO MENTOR BY THE EXPLANTING PHYSICIAN THAT THIS PT WAS EXPERIENCING SYMPTOMS OF MS (NUMBNESS IN LEGS AND DIFFICULTY WALKING) SINCE HER DEFLATION IN (B)(6) 2005. THE PT WAS RE-IMPLANTED AT THAT TIME WITH MENTOR SALINE-FILLED MAMMARY PROSTHESES. SHE HAS ALSO PRESENTED WITH A RIGHT DEFLATION. SINCE REMOVING THESE DEVICES, THE PT'S SYMPTOMS HAVE SUBSIDED AND THE PT CAN WALK. BECAUSE THE LEFT PROSTHESIS INVOLVED IN THIS COMPLAINT WILL NOT BE RETURNED TO MENTOR, PE WAS PRECLUDED FROM EVALUATING THE DEVICE. BASED ON THE LABORATORY EVAL, PE CONCLUDED THE RIGHT DEFLATION WAS MOST LIKELY DUE TO THE RENT THAT MEASURED APPROX .1 CM IN LENGTH, WITHIN THE CREASE, ON THE POSTERIOR ASPECT OF THE DEVICE. A MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION OF THE EDGES OF THE RENT REVEALED A TAPERED WEAR PATTERN. TAPER WEAR IS CHARACTERISTIC OF A CREASE/FOLD FAILURE. A CREASE/FOLD FAILURE IS A KNOWN INHERENT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF SALINE-FILLED MAMMARY PROSTHESES AND MAY BE THE RESULT OF ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: UNDERINFLATION OR OVERINFLATION OF THE DEVICE, CONTINUOUS AND SUSTAINED STRESSES TO THE DEVICE - SUCH AS CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR TOO SMALL A BREAST POCKET, AND FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE SHELL IN THE BREAST POCKET. LEAK TESTING OF THE DEVICE REVEALED NO OTHER LEAKAGE SITES. BECAUSE THE RISK OF DEVICE DEFLATION CANNOT BE ELIMINATED, MENTOR ADDRESSES THIS RISK IN THE PIDS BY STATING THAT THESE DEVICES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED LIFETIME DEVICES. THE MENTOR MICROBIOLOGY DEPT ASSURES THE STERILITY OF DEVICES INDICATING THAT THEY MEET ALL STERILIZATION PARAMETERS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A 10E-6 STERILITY ASSURANCE LEVEL PRIOR TO RELEASE FOR DISTRIBUTION. PE CONCLUDED THE REPORTED INFECTION IN THE PT'S BREAST OCCURRED FROM A SOURCE OTHER THAN THE DEVICES. INFECTION IS A KNOWN COMPLICATION ASSOCIATED WITH ANY SURGERY AND IS REFERENCED IN OUR CURRENT PRODUCT INSERT DATA SHEET. THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE (IOM) OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCE RELEASED A FINAL REPORT STATING ""A REVIEW OF SEVENTEEN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL REPORTS OF CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS WAS REMARKABLE FOR ITS CONSISTENCY IN FINDING NO ELEVATED RISKS OR ODDS RATIO FOR AN ASSOCIATION OF IMPLANTS WITH DISEASE...THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT SILICONE IMPLANTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY MAJOR DISEASE OF THE WHOLE BODY. WOMEN ARE EXPOSED TO SILICONE CONSTANTLY IN THEIR DAILY LIVES. THERE IS NO PLAUSIBLE EVIDENCE OF A NOVEL AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE CAUSED BY IMPLANTS."" BASED ON THESE REPORTS, PE IS UNABLE TO CONFIRM THAT THE REPORTED COMPLAINTS ARE DEVICE RELATED; HOWEVER, MENTOR CONTINUES TO INCLUDE EXTENSIVE DISCUSSIONS ON ALLEGED SILICONE RESPONSES IN ITS PRODUCT INSERT DATA SHEETS SO THAT THE PT AND PHYSICIAN ARE FULLY INFORMED OF ANY POTENTIAL RISKS.

DEVICE LABELING: IN ADDITION, CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED REGARDING POTENTIAL DAMAGING EFFECTS ON CHILDREN BORN TO MOTHERS WITH IMPLANTS. TWO STUDIES IN HUMANS HAVE FOUND THAT THE RISK OF BIRTH DEFECTS OVERALL IS NOT INCREASED IN CHILDREN BORN AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY. ALTHOUGH LOW BIRTH WEIGHT WAS REPORTED IN A THIRD STUDY, OTHER FACTORS (FOR EXAMPLE, LOWER PRE-PREGNANCY WEIGHT) MAY EXPLAIN THIS FINDING. THIS AUTHOR RECOMMENDED FURTHER RESEARCH ON INFANT HEALTH.

5761253|48540699|D|1||I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER IN MY RIGHT BREAST IN (B)(6) 2010. I CONTACTED A BREAST CANCER SURGEON AND SHE TOLD ME I NEEDED TO HAVE A MASTECTOMY SINCE THERE WERE 2 TUMORS IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF MY BREAST. I ALSO CONTACTED A RECONSTRUCTIVE/PLASTIC SURGEON. I AGREED TO HAVE AN IMPLANT PUT IN AT THE SAME TIME AS MY SURGERY. THE PLASTIC SURGEON PUT IN A TISSUE EXPANDER FOR THREE MONTHS AND ON (B)(6) 2011, I HAD AN ALLERGAN TEXTURED BREAST IMPLANT PUT IN. THE STYLE OF THE IMPLANT HAD NOT BEEN APPROVED BY THE FDA YET, SO I SIGNED A CONSENT FORM TO BE PART OF A STUDY. I READ THE AGREEMENT THOROUGHLY AND THERE WERE ONLY TWO POSSIBLE RISKS: INFECTION OR COMPARTMENT CONTRACTURE. THERE WAS NO MENTION OF LYMPHOMA CANCER. APPROXIMATELY 2 YEARS LATER THE FDA APPROVED THIS STYLE IMPLANT AND THE STUDY WAS ENDED. ON (B)(6) 2016 MY RIGHT BREAST BECAME TIGHT AND HARD. IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS IT BECAME LARGER AND LARGER. I CONTACTED MY PLASTIC SURGEON AND SHE ASKED ME TO TAKE A PICTURE OF MY BREAST AND SEND TO HER, SINCE I WAS OUT OF TOWN AT THE TIME. SHE ORDERED AN ANTIBIOTIC AND MADE AN APPOINTMENT FOR ME TO SEE HER THE FOLLOWING WEEK. I WENT TO SEE HER AND SHE TOOK MORE PICTURES AND TOLD ME IT WAS PROBABLY AN INFECTION AND I SHOULD CONTINUE ANTIBIOTIC. MY BREAST GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER AND MY SURGEON DECIDED TO REMOVE MY IMPLANT. DURING THE SURGERY SHE TOOK A TISSUE SAMPLE AND THEN PUT IN A NEW TEXTURED IMPLANT AND CLOSED UP INCISION. ON (B)(6), THE PATHOLOGY REPORT CAME BACK WITH THE DIAGNOSIS OF ALCL. IT WAS CONFIRMED BY A PET CT SCAN. MY SURGEON SAID THAT SHE KNEW THE DOCTOR WHO SPECIALIZED IN ALCL AND THAT HE WAS AT THE (B)(6). MY HUSBAND AND I FLEW TO (B)(6) TO HAVE IMPLANT AND SURROUNDING SCAR TISSUE REMOVED BY THE SURGEONS WHO ARE THE AUTHORITY ON THIS DISEASE. ALSO, THE RESEARCH ON THIS DISEASE IS BEING DONE BY A TEAM THERE. THEY HAVE SEEN MOST OF THE DIAGNOSED CASES IN THE US. I HAD OTHER TESTS DONE THERE: AN ULTRASOUND AND A CHEST X-RAY. I SPOKE WITH THE DOCTOR AND HE TOLD ME THAT THE LYMPHOMA WAS ONLY IN THE FLUID SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT AND NOT IN THE SCAR TISSUE (CAPSULE) OR IN MY LYMPH NODES. I HAD THE SURGERY ON (B)(6) 2016 AND WAS INFORMED THAT ALL OF THE CANCER CELLS WERE REMOVED AND I WAS NOW CANCER FREE. I DECIDED TO HAVE A SMOOTH SILICONE IMPLANT PUT IN DURING THE SURGERY RATHER THAN COME BACK LATER FOR ADDITIONAL RECONSTRUCTION. THE DOCTOR TOLD ME THAT NONE OF THE ALCL CASES HAD EVER INVOLVED A SMOOTH IMPLANT. I ALSO AGREED TO HAVE A PET CT SCAN EVERY 6 MONTHS TO BE SURE THERE WERE NO NEW CANCER CELLS.|NATRELLE TEXTURED BREAST IMPLANT||06/27/2016||||N|*||I|FTR|1.0||BREAST IMPLANT|||||||ALLERGAN|||||||True

WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGAN'S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERS' BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.

5369613|36250016|D|1||CIRCA 1996, I UNDERWENT A BI-LATERAL MASTECTOMY FOR CANCER WITH IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION. AFTER EXPANDERS WERE USED, MENTOR SILTEX IMPLANTS (SILICONE GEL) WERE INSERTED. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A PHYSICALLY ACTIVE PERSON. I WAS A CLASSICAL BALLET DANCER ON A PROFESSIONAL TRACK. SINCE THE AGE OF 11, I DANCED IN A COMPANY, AND LATER, MOVED INTO TEACHING BALLET FOR A COMPETITIVE GYMNASTICS TEAM. OVER THE YEARS SINCE RECEIVING IMPLANTS MY HEALTH HAS STEADILY DECLINED AND ALL SYMPTOMS HAVE CONSISTENTLY WORSENED. THEY HAVE COME TO A HEAD DURING THE LAST 2 TO 3 YEARS. THE WORST PART OF THAT DECLINE IS SEVERE, DEBILITATING FATIGUE WITH SEVERE PAIN AND INJURY WITH ANY EXERTION AND HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, DEBILITATING MIGRAINES. BUT THOSE ARE CERTAINLY NOT MY ONLY SYMPTOMS. I HAVE BROUGHT MY ISSUES TO MY PCPS OVER THE LAST YEARS. THEY TESTED ME FOR A FEW POSSIBLE COMMON CAUSES, BUT COULDN'T FIND A REASON. EVENTUALLY, THEY JUST IGNORED THESE SYMPTOMS. I RECENTLY CHANGED PCPS AND MY NEW ONE BEGAN A DILIGENT PROCESS OF ELIMINATION. SHE HAS BEEN SENDING ME TO SPECIALISTS AND WE'VE BEEN DOING ONE TEST AFTER ANOTHER TO RULE THINGS OUT. THEY'VE ALL COME OUT NORMAL. UNTIL WE DID A BREAST ULTRASOUND. IT SHOWED SIGNS OF IMPLANT RUPTURE. I WAS SENT TO DO AN MRI, AND IT CONFIRMED IMPLANT RUPTURE. DUE TO MY MASTECTOMIES, I HAVE NO SENSATION IN MY BREAST OR ARMPIT AREAS, SO WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG AGO THE RUPTURE TOOK PLACE. BECAUSE SILENT RUPTURES ARE COMMON, THE RUPTURE COULD HAVE HAPPENED YEARS AGO. THE CHANGE IN SHAPE AND SIZE AND THEIR ASYMMETRY HAS BEEN NOTICEABLE FOR SOME YEARS, BUT MY PREVIOUS PCP HAD NO COMMENT ABOUT THAT. I AM EXTREMELY UPSET THAT I WAS NOT SENT FOR A BREAST ULTRASOUND OR OTHER RELATED TEST BY MY PREVIOUS PCP. ALL THE LITERATURE SAYS THAT PEOPLE WITH BREAST IMPLANTS SHOULD BE FOLLOWED ON A REGULAR BASIS. I AM EXTREMELY THANKFUL THAT I HAVE FOUND A DILIGENT PCP AND AN NOW IN GOOD CARE. I KNOW THAT A CONNECTION BETWEEN IMPLANTS AND RUPTURED IMPLANTS AND HEALTH ISSUES ISN'T SOMETHING THE MAJORITY OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION WANTS TO ADMIT, BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE CONNECTION IS REAL. SINCE DISCOVERING THAT MY IMPLANTS ARE RUPTURED, I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONNECT WITH OVER (B)(6) WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS OR RUPTURED IMPLANTS WHO ARE HAVING THE SAME SYMPTOMS I HAVE, AND MORE. MANY OF THEM ARE IN WORSE CONDITION THAN I AM. ALL OF US HAVE LOST QUALITY OF LIFE. A HUGE PERCENTAGE OF THEM REPORT THAT THEIR HEALTH ISSUES SUBSIDE AFTER HAVING THEIR IMPLANTS REMOVED. AND THESE ARE ONLY THE WOMEN WITH WHOM I HAVE CONNECTED. THERE MUST BE SO MANY MORE OUT THERE. THE WORST PART OF ALL THIS IS THAT OUR CONDITIONS ARE BEING IGNORED OR POO-POOED BY THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY SO THERE IS OFTEN NO HELP FOR US UNLESS AND UNTIL WE CAN FIND A DOCTOR WHO TAKES OUT HEALTH SERIOUSLY. I AM CURRENTLY WAITING FOR A DATE TO HAVE MY IMPLANTS REMOVED. I WILL NOT HAVE THEM REPLACED. I AM PRAYING THAT, ONCE THEY ARE REMOVED, I WILL BE ABLE TO REGAIN MY HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE.|SILTEX LB GEL-FILLED MAMMARY PROSTHESIS|354*2007|01/12/2016||||*|*||I|FWM|1.0||SILTEX LB GEL-FILLED MAMMARY PROSTHESIS||L13410|||||MENTOR MEDICAL SYSTEMS B.
