THE REPORTED DEVICE WAS INTACT AT THE TIME OF PRODUCTION AND MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. REPORTED EVENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN THE LABELING: PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENT. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. YOU SHOULD PERFORM SELF-EXAMINATION OF YOUR BREASTS EVERY MONTH FOR CANCER SCREENING. HOWEVER, THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU DISTINGUISH THE IMPLANT FROM YOUR BREAST TISSUE. THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGES IN IMPLANT SHAPE, MAY BE SIGNS OF A RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. THESE SIGNS SHOULD BE REPORTED TO YOUR SURGEON AND POSSIBLY EVALUATED WITH AN MRI. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM.

6498449|72963713|N|1||THIS REPORT IS SUBMITTED IN RESPONSE TO FDA NOTICE TITLED BREAST IMPLANT-ASSOCIATED ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (BIA-ALCL) PROVIDED ON 21/MAR/2017. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CASES REFERENCED IN THE NOTICE IS 359, INCLUDING 9 DEATHS. THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE NOTICE CLASSIFIES THE ALCL EVENTS IN DIFFERENT CATEGORIES, INCLUDING TYPES OF DEVICE, ASSOCIATED ADVERSE EVENTS, PRESENTATION, AND DIAGNOSIS DETAILS, BUT DOES NOT IDENTIFY SPECIFIC DEVICES OR PATIENTS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO INDIVIDUALIZE THIS INFORMATION INTO SPECIFIC REPORTS, AND BY DEFINITION ALREADY INCLUDES EVENTS REPORTED BY ALLERGAN IN THE PAST. THEREFORE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH 21 CFR 803, THIS REPORT WILL REPRESENT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF RECEIPT OF THE NOTICE AND DOCUMENTATION OF ALLERGAN'S ATTEMPT TO INVESTIGATE ADVERSE EVENTS IDENTIFIED IN THAT NOTICE. THIS REPORT WILL NOT SUBSTITUTE FOR ANY INVESTIGATION INTO COMPLAINTS RECEIVED WHERE INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS OR ALLERGAN DEVICES ARE IDENTIFIED, INCLUSIVE OR EXCLUSIVE OF THE 359 CASES MENTIONED IN THE NOTICE. (B)(4). THE EVENTS OF DEATH, LYMPHOMA-ALCL, LYMPHOMA, SEROMA, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, AND BREAST LUMPS ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THESE EVENTS. SALINE DEVICE LABELING: RADIATION TO THE BREAST Â¿ ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE IN VIVO EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, ASYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER THESE ADDITIONAL SURGERIES. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF DEFLATION. ADDITIONAL COMPLICATIONS Â¿ AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. CALCIUM DEPOSITS CAN FORM IN THE TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT WITH SYMPTOMS THAT MAY INCLUDE PAIN AND FIRMNESS. LYMPHADENOPATHY HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED IN SOME WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS. IN THE PASS STUDY, AT LEAST 1 REOPERATION WAS PERFORMED ON 315 PATIENTS (36.5%) THROUGH 10 YEARS. A TOTAL OF 424 REOPERATIONS WERE PERFORMED. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR REOPERATION THROUGH 10 YEARS ON AUGMENTATION PATIENTS WAS IMPLANT DEFLATION AT 21.7%. THE PERCENTAGE OF REOPERATIONS DUE TO LUMP/MASS/CYST INCREASED FROM 8.5% OF 293 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 5 YEARS TO 13.9% OF 424 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 10 YEARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF LUMPS, MASSES, AND CYSTS CAN BE EXPECTED TO NATURALLY INCREASE AS PATIENTS AGE AND COULD BE AN EXPLANATION FOR THE INCREASE. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. FOR MORE COMPLETE AND UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ON FDAÂ¿S ANALYSIS AND REVIEW OF THE ALCL IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST IMPLANTS PLEASE VISIT: HTTP://WWW.FDA.GOV/MEDICALDEVICES/PRODUCTSANDMEDICALPROCEDURES/IMPLANTSANDPROSTHETICS/BREASTIMPLANTS/UCM239995.HTM YOU ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO REPORT ANY PRODUCT PROBLEM OR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT TO ALLERGAN. DEATHS MUST BE REPORTED TO ALLERGAN AND FDA. SILICONE DEVICE LABELING: ONE OF THE KEY COMPLICATIONS REPORTED IS CALLED Â¿CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE.Â¿ CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS A TIGHTENING OF THE SCAR TISSUE (ALSO CALLED A CAPSULE) THAT NORMALLY FORMS AROUND THE BREAST IMPLANT DURING THE HEALING PROCESS AFTER SURGERY. IN SOME WOMEN, THE SCAR TISSUE (CAPSULE) SQUEEZES THE IMPLANT. THIS RESULTS IN FIRMNESS OR HARDENING OF THE BREAST, AND IT IS A RISK FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE. DEGREES OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE ARE CLASSIFIED BY THE BAKER GRADING SCALE.1 CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BAKER GRADES III AND IV ARE THE MOST SEVERE. BAKER GRADE III OFTEN RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SURGERY (REOPERATION) BECAUSE OF PAIN AND POSSIBLY ABNORMAL APPEARANCE. BAKER GRADE IV USUALLY RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR REOPERATION BECAUSE OF PAIN AND UNACCEPTABLE APPEARANCE. DO NOT TREAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BY CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY OR FORCEFUL EXTERNAL COMPRESSION, WHICH WILL LIKELY RESULT IN IMPLANT DAMAGE, RUPTURE, FOLDS, AND/OR HEMATOMA. ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. YOU SHOULD PERFORM SELF-EXAMINATION OF YOUR BREASTS EVERY MONTH FOR CANCER SCREENING. HOWEVER, THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU DISTINGUISH THE IMPLANT FROM YOUR BREAST TISSUE. THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGES IN IMPLANT SHAPE, MAY BE SIGNS OF A RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. THESE SIGNS SHOULD BE REPORTED TO YOUR SURGEON AND POSSIBLY EVALUATED WITH AN MRI. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM.

REPORTS IN THE MEDICAL LITERATURE INDICATE THAT PATIENTS WITH BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT AT A GREATER RISK THAN THOSE WITHOUT BREAST IMPLANTS FOR DEVELOPING BREAST CANCER. REPORTS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT BREAST IMPLANTS MAY INTERFERE WITH OR DELAY BREAST CANCER DETECTION BY MAMMOGRAPHY AND/OR BIOPSY; HOWEVER, OTHER REPORTS IN THE PUBLISHED MEDICAL LITERATURE INDICATE THAT BREAST IMPLANTS NEITHER SIGNIFICANTLY DELAY BREAST CANCER DETECTION NOR ADVERSELY AFFECT CANCER SURVIVAL OF WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS. A LARGE FOLLOW-UP STUDY REPORTED NO EVIDENCE OF AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND CANCER, AND EVEN SHOWED A DECREASED INCIDENCE OF BREAST CANCER COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION. ONE STUDY HAS REPORTED AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF BRAIN CANCER IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS AS COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION. THE INCIDENCE OF BRAIN CANCER, HOWEVER, WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS WHEN COMPARED TO WOMEN WHO HAD OTHER PLASTIC SURGERIES A PUBLISHED REVIEW OF 4 LARGE STUDIES IN WOMEN WITH COSMETIC IMPLANTS AND AN ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP STUDY CONCLUDED THAT THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT SUPPORT AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BRAIN CANCER AND BREAST IMPLANTS. AN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL REVIEW ALSO LENT SUPPORT TO THE LACK OF CAUSATION BETWEEN IMPLANTS AND ANY TYPE OF CANCER. STUDIES HAVE REPORTED AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF RESPIRATORY/LUNG CANCER IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS. OTHER STUDIES OF WOMEN IN SWEDEN AND DENMARK HAVE FOUND THAT WOMEN WHO GET BREAST IMPLANTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE CURRENT SMOKERS THAN WOMEN WHO GET BREAST REDUCTION SURGERY OR OTHER TYPES OF COSMETIC SURGERY. SEVERAL LARGE STUDIES HAVE FOUND NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND RESPIRATORY/LUNG CANCER. TWO STUDIES REPORTED AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF CERVICAL/VULVAR CANCER IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS. ANOTHER LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP STUDY SHOWED EQUIVALENT INCIDENCES OF CERVICAL CANCER IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION. OTHER RECENT LARGE STUDIES CONCLUDED THAT THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT SUPPORT AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM CANCERS AND BREAST IMPLANTS. THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL STUDIES PUBLISHED THAT EXAMINED THE RISK OF OTHER TYPES OF CANCERS, E.G., THYROID CANCERS, URINARY SYSTEM CANCERS, SARCOMA, ENDOCRINE CANCER, CONNECTIVE TISSUE CANCER, CANCER OF THE EYE, AND UNSPECIFIED CANCERS IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS.

REPORTED EVENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN THE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS.

THE REPORTED EVENTS ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THESE EVENTS. REVIEW OF DHR (DEVICE HISTORY RECORD) FOR WORK ORDER (B)(4) DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY DEVIATIONS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS OR NON-CONFORMANCES DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. ALL GEL BREAST IMPLANTS WERE REVIEWED AS PART OF THE ASSEMBLY OPERATIONS AND THESE TASKS WERE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO APPLICABLE CURRENT PROCEDURES TO ENSURE THAT ASSEMBLY MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. DHR FOR WORK ORDER (B)(4) INDICATES THAT THERE WAS A REPROCESS FOR TWO UNITS ON THE PRIMARY PACKAGING OPERATION, HOWEVER THIS WAS COMPLETED ON A DIFFERENT SERIAL NUMBER UNIT AND THIS HAS NO RELATION NEITHER CAN CAUSE THE REPORTED EVENT. THE DHR ASSEMBLY REPORT FROM ORACLE WAS VERIFIED AND THERE WAS NOT ANY SCRAP RELATED WITH REPORTED EVENT, ALL DEVICES WERE CONFORMANCE DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION GATHERED DURING THE DHR REVIEW, THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT DEVICES FROM WORK ORDER (B)(4) WERE ASSEMBLED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALLERGAN MEDICAL PROCEDURES AND SPECIFICATIONS. THE REPORTED DEVICE WAS INTACT AT THE TIME OF PRODUCTION AND MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. REPORTED EVENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN THE LABELING: ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. YOU SHOULD PERFORM SELF-EXAMINATION OF YOUR BREASTS EVERY MONTH FOR CANCER SCREENING. HOWEVER, THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU DISTINGUISH THE IMPLANT FROM YOUR BREAST TISSUE. THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGES IN IMPLANT SHAPE, MAY BE SIGNS OF A RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. THESE SIGNS SHOULD BE REPORTED TO YOUR SURGEON AND POSSIBLY EVALUATED WITH AN MRI. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY.

6386903|69480688|D|1||ONE OF THE FIRST SIGNS THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WAS IN EARLY (B)(6) 2009. I WAS HOSPITALIZED FOR RAPID HEART RATE AND LOW BLOOD PRESSURE. I WAS LATER DIAGNOSED WITH POSTURAL ORTHOSTATIC TACHYCARDIA SYNDROME AND PLACED ON METOPROLOL. I WAS ABLE TO RETURN TO A MOSTLY NORMAL LIFE, ALTHOUGH THE SYMPTOMS NEVER WENT AWAY. FROM THAT TIME ON, I DEVELOPED MORE AND MORE SYMPTOMS THAT PILED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER. THEY RANGED FROM FAIRLY BENIGN TO INCREASINGLY MORE SERIOUS AND PROBLEMATIC. I SUFFERED BOUTS OF VERTIGO; A RASH THAT LEFT PAINFUL SORES, RINGING IN MY EARS, BALANCE ISSUES, BLADDER AND KIDNEY ISSUES, A DIAGNOSIS OF INTERSTITIAL CYSTITIS, MEMORY AND COGNITIVE PROBLEMS, FOOD SENSITIVITIES AND DEBILITATING DIGESTIVE ISSUES, CONSTANT NAUSEA, NEUROLOGICAL ISSUES, TUNNEL VISION, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, HEART PALPITATIONS, DEBILITATING WEAKNESS AND FATIGUE. I GREW INCREASINGLY WEAKER AND MORE ILL. I WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO WORK AND WAS PLACED ON DISABILITY. I BEGAN USING A CANE, THEN A WALKER, AND EVENTUALLY HAD TO BE PUSHED IN A WHEELCHAIR. NO ONE HAD ANY ANSWERS FOR ME. ONE WEEKEND IN EARLY 2014, I TOOK A SEVERE TURN FOR THE WORSE. I COULD NO LONGER GET OUT OF BED AND HAD TO HAVE ASSISTANCE BATHING AND DRESSING. I HAPPENED TO NOTICE THAT ONE OF MY BREAST IMPLANTS (FROM BREAST CANCER IN 2000) HAD GONE FLAT. WE BEGAN TO WONDER IF MY ILLNESS COULD HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH MY IMPLANTS. MY HUSBAND BEGAN TO RESEARCH THAT POSSIBLE RELATIONSHIP. IN (B)(6) 2014, BOTH RUPTURED IMPLANTS, DAMAGED LYMPH NODES, AFFECTED CHEST MUSCLE, AND SURROUNDING TISSUE (TO MY CHEST WALL) WERE REMOVED DURING A 7 HOUR SURGERY. OVER THE PAST 3 YEARS I HAVE SLOWLY BEGUN TO IMPROVE. I CAN WALK SHORT DISTANCES WITH THE USE OF A CANE; I STILL HAVE TO USE AN ELECTRIC SCOOTER OR BE PUSHED IN A WHEELCHAIR IF I HAVE TO STAND FOR LONG OR GO VERY FAR. I STILL HAVE MOST SYMPTOMS, BUT MANY HAVE IMPROVED AT LEAST SLIGHTLY. I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO RETURN TO THE JOB THAT I LOVED. I USED TO BE AN ACTIVE, SOCIAL, HAPPY, HARD-WORKING PERSON. NOW I RARELY LEAVE MY HOUSE - NEVER WITHOUT ASSISTANCE. BESIDES DEVELOPING MULTIPLE FOOD SENSITIVITIES, I HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED AN EXTREME SENSITIVITY TO MOLD AND CHEMICAL EXPOSURE. I FEEL LIKE A VIRTUAL SHELL OF THE PERSON THAT I ONCE WAS. I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING TO HAVE MY LIFE BACK. DAMAGED/FAULTY IMPLANTS HAVE RUINED MY HEALTH AND MANY ASPECTS OF MY LIFE.|BREAST IMPLANTS||03/06/2017||||Y|I||I|FWM|1.0||BREAST IMPLANTS||5687317|||||MENTOR|||||||True

THE PATIENT WAS IMPLANTED WITH MENTOR SMOOTH ROUND GEL MAMMARY PROSTHESES ON (B)(6) 2005. (CATALOG # 350-7300BC, SERIAL NUMBER LEFT SIDE (B)(4) AND SERIAL NUMBER RIGHT SIDE (B)(4)). THE PATIENT HAD A MAMMOGRAM DONE ON 10/20/2015 THAT SHOWED Â¿SOME MICRO CALCIFICATIONS IN THE LEFT SUPERIOR BREASTÂ¿ AND RECOMMENDED PATIENT ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN PRIOR MAMMOGRAM IMAGES FOR COMPARISON AND FOR ADDITIONAL IMAGING (SPOT MAGNIFICATION VIEWS) TO EVALUATE THE MICRO CALCIFICATIONS. THEY ALSO RECOMMENDED ULTRASOUND AT THE DISCRETION OF THE RADIOLOGIST. CONCLUSION ON CALCIFICATIONS WAS BI-RADS CATEGORY: 0- INCOMPLETE: NEEDS ADDITIONAL IMAGING EVALUATION. ADDITIONAL MAMMOGRAMS WERE DONE ON (B)(6) 2016 AND (B)(6) 2017. A BILATERAL BREAST MRI WAS DONE ON (B)(6) 2017 DUE TO RECENT DIAGNOSIS OF LEFT BREAST CANCER (EXACT DATE OF DIAGNOSIS IS UNKNOWN) THE MRI WAS DONE TO ASSESS EXTENT OF DISEASE AND FOR POSSIBLE CONTRALATERAL DISEASE.

I'VE FOCUSED ON EVERY BODY PART WITH EVERY SPECIALIST IN EVERY FIELD, BUT I NEVER FOCUSED ON MY BREASTS BECAUSE I WAS ALWAYS TOLD IT COULDN'T BE MY IMPLANTS. LAST WEEK I HAD A BREAST SONOGRAM AND IT SHOWED A .7CM SWOLLEN LYMPH NODE IN MY RIGHT BREAST (NOT SUSPICIOUS FOR CANCER). TODAY I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BAKER GRADE 4 CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IN MY RIGHT BREAST, BY A RECONSTRUCTIVE BREAST SURGEON. GOD ONLY KNOWS HOW LONG I'VE HAD IT! SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE AND SOMEONE NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THOUSANDS OF WOMEN LOSING THEIR LIVES AND QUALITY OF LIVES FROM EITHER SALINE OR SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. IMPORTANT INFORMATION: MCGHAN SILTEX SALINE FILLED MAMMARY PROTHESIS (LOT #FW7879 LEFT 390CC AND LOT #FW2756 RIGHT 390CC) IMPLANTED BY DR (B)(6) OF (B)(6) ON (B)(6) 1993 OVER THE MUSCLE WITH RECONSTRUCTION. AFTER CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE AND IMPLANT RUPTURES, MCGHAN STYLE #468 TEXTURED SALINE IMPLANTS (CAT #27-468561 LEFT #HK6992 650CC'S RIGHT LOT# GK5386 700CC'S) WAS IMPLANTED BY DR (B)(6) OF (B)(6) ON (B)(6) 1996. ON (B)(6) 2017 CAPSULAR CONTRACTION AGAIN, IMPLANTS TO BE REMOVED AND TOTAL ENBLOC CAPSULECTOMY SOON, HOPEFULLY. I AM IN A (B)(6) GROUP WITH OVER 17,800 WOMEN (AND CONSTANTLY GROWING) WITH SIMILAR STORIES AS MINE WHO HAVE EITHER SILICONE OR SALINE BREASTS IMPLANTS. WHEN THEY EXPLANT THEM VIA AN ENBLOC CAPSULECTOMY, ALL OF THEIR SYMPTOMS AND ILLNESSES GO AWAY. TESTS GO BACK TO NORMAL. WOMEN'S EYES, FACES, SKIN START TO LOOK BETTER, HEALTHIER AND WOMEN'S AUTOIMMUNE ISSUES DISAPPEAR. THEY START TO DETOX AND HEAL AND CAN START TO REGAIN SOME OF THEIR LIVES. IMPLANTS COME OUT WITH MOLD AND TOXINS. THE IMPLANTS AND THE WOMEN'S BODIES ARE TESTED AND ARE FOUND TO HAVE TOXINS, MOLDS, SILICONE AND THE CHEMICALS WHICH MAKE UP SILICONE IN THEM AND ALL OVER THEM. THE BREAST IMPLANT INDUSTRY KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE PUTTING INTO WOMEN'S BODIES AND WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THEM, IT JUST NEEDS TO BE PROVEN IN A COURT OF LAW AND IT'S TIME. CANCER IS NOW LINKED TO BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE THAT TYPE OF CANCER BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE IS TO TAKE OUT THE IMPLANTS AND TEST THE FLUID AROUND THE IMPLANTS. WOMEN ARE DYING AND WE NEED THE FDA'S HELP, PLEASE!|SILTEX SALINE FILLED MAMMARY PROSTHESIS||04/26/2017||||Y|I||0HP|FWM|2.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST||L-FW7879 R-FW2756|||||MCGHAN/ALLERGAN|||||||True

SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL.

SHE BECAME EXTREMELY ILL IN (B)(6) 2012, SHE DID NOT GO TO THE HOSPITAL UNTIL (B)(6) 2013 BECAUSE SHE DID NOT HAVE ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. SHE WAS ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL ON (B)(6) 2013 WITH UNCONTROLLED DIARRHEA. SHE WAS ADMITTED AGAIN ON (B)(6) 2013 WITH DEHYDRATION AND ON (B)(6) 2013 DEHYDRATION. ON (B)(6) 2013 SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH METASTATIC BREAST CANCER TO BRAIN, LIVER, ESSENTIALLY THROUGHOUT HER ENTIRE BODY. SHE WAS TRANSFERRED TO INPATIENT REHAB ON (B)(6) 2013. FOLLOW UP VISIT WITH THE NEUROLOGIST SHOWED THAT ALTHOUGH SHE HAD MANY BRAIN LESIONS, THE SPINAL TAP WAS NEGATIVE FOR CANCER CELLS. A FULL BODY AND BRAIN PET SCAN WAS COMPLETED ON (B)(6) 2013. THIS SHOWED THAT SHE HAD LESIONS (TOO MANY TO COUNT) THROUGHOUT HER ENTIRE BODY. THE NEUROLOGIST WAS NOT CONVINCED THAT IT WAS METASTATIC BREAST CANCER IN THE BRAIN BECAUSE IT WAS ATYPICAL OF WHAT HE SAW WITH BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. HE THOUGHT POSSIBLE SARCOID OR LYMPHOMA. THE NEUROLOGIST STARTED HER ON LARGE DOSES OF STEROIDS AND OVER SEVERAL MONTHS AND REPEATED THE FULL BODY AND BRAIN PET SCAN ON (B)(6) 2013 WHICH THE RADIOLOGIST COMPARED TO THE PET SCAN OF (B)(6) 2013. THE RADIOLOGIST REPORTED THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE LESIONS FOUND ON THE (B)(6) 2013 EXAM HAD ESSENTIALLY ""MELTED"" AWAY AND THE HYPER METABOLIC BOWEL WAS COMPLETELY RESOLVED. HE ALSO WROTE ""BOTH OF THE ABOVE FINDINGS UNDOUBTEDLY REPRESENT SARCOID. AS THE NEUROLOGIST BEGAN TAPERING OFF THE STEROIDS, HE REPEATED SEVERAL MRI'S OF HER BRAIN, IN (B)(6) 2013, SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY AND BEGAN INCREASING THE STEROIDS TO SOME DEGREE. IN (B)(6) 2015, SHE BEGAN HAVING VISION PROBLEMS AND HEADACHES. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE LESIONS HAD RETURNED AND THIS TIME, THEY WERE ON HER RETINAS AS WELL THROUGHOUT HER ENTIRE BODY. WE TOOK HER TO (B)(6) CLINIC FOR EVALUATION OF HER RETINAS. WE DISCUSSED OUR THEORY THAT THIS WAS POSSIBLY RELATED TO THE BREAST IMPLANT AND NOT BREAST METASTASES. THE PHYSICIANS AT (B)(6) REVIEWED ALL OF THE MEDICAL RECORDS THAT WE BROUGHT WITH US AND FELT THAT SARCOID WAS A POSSIBILITY BUT WOULD NEED TO BIOPSY HER RETINA TO DETERMINE FOR SURE. THE BIOPSY WAS DONE AT (B)(6) CLINIC AND WAS REPORTED TO BE BREAST METASTASES. AT THIS POINT, SHE CONTINUED WITH FOLLOW UP VISITS TO MULTIPLE DOCTORS. ON (B)(6) 2015 MET WITH ONCOLOGISTS AT (B)(6) AT FAMILY REQUEST - PATIENT AND FAMILY REQUESTED THAT THE IMPLANT BE REMOVED BUT THEY DID NOT WANT TO DO IT. SHE MET WITH (B)(6) ONCOLOGIST ON (B)(6) 2015 WHERE SHE AGAIN REQUESTED THAT THE IMPLANT BE REMOVED. THE ONCOLOGIST SCHEDULED A LIVER BIOPSY AND THAT WAS DONE ON (B)(6) 2015. REPEATED VISITS TO DIFFERENT ONCOLOGISTS REPORTED THAT SHE HAD BREAST METASTASES AND WOULD NEED CHEMOTHERAPY. SHE REFUSED TO UNDERGO CHEMOTHERAPY. SHE HAD A LIVER BIOPSY ON (B)(6) 2015 AT (B)(6) CANCER INSTITUTE AND AGAIN SHE RECEIVED THE DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST METASTASES. SHE PASSED AWAY ON (B)(6) 2015 AT THE AGE OF (B)(6) YEARS.

IN SIXTEEN YEARS NOT ONE DR EVER TOLD HER THAT IMPLANTS COULD BE CAUSING SYMPTOMS OF MUSCLE PAIN, ELEVATED LIVER COUNTS, JOINT PAIN AND STIFFNESS, SORE LYMPH NODES, PULMONARY IRREGULARITIES, WEAKNESS AND FATIGUE, HEADACHES, RASH, PHOTOSENSITIVITY, NUMBNESS IN LEG AND BACK, LOW GRADE FEVERS, AND DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY OVER MEMORY PROBLEMS. ALL OF THESE SYMPTOMS CAN BE TRACED THROUGH RPTR'S MEDICAL RECORD GOING BACK TO 1978. THE ONLY PUBLIC RECOGNITION OF THESE SYMPTOMS HAS BEEN RELATED TO THE LEAKING OF GEL IMPLANTS. THE SILICONE SACKS CAUSE JUST AS MUCH OF A PROBLEM. IN 1985 RPTR HAD A FULL BLOWN AUTOIMMUNE RESPONSE WITH EVERY SYMPTOM MENTIONED EARLIER IN THIS LETTER. RPTR LOST OVER A YEAR OF HER LIFE. SHE COULDN'T TAKE CARE OF HER SMALL CHILDREN OR GET OUT OF BED FOR MORE THAN A SHORT TIME. SHE WENT TO MORE THAN EIGHT DRS THAT YEAR ALONE. MOST BLOOD SAMPLES WERE WITHIN NORMAL RANGE. THE SYMPTOMS PERSISTED OFF AND ON FOR YEARS. AND TO THIS DAY RPTR HAS LEARNED TO LIVE WITH THEM. IT HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS SHOCK FOR RPTR TO REALIZE AFTER READING CASE STUDIES OF WOMEN WITH NOT ONLY GEL-FILLED BUT ALSO SALINE-FILLED IMPLANTS THAT THEIR SYMPTOMS ARE JUST LIKE HERS. RPTR WAS NEVER TOLD, EVEN AFTER FIVE MAMMOGRAMS, THAT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETECT ALL CANCERS WITH THIS TEST. DR NEVER TOLD HER THE MAMMOGRAM REPORTS STATED A CONTAINED RUPTURE. NO ONE TOLD HER HER BREAST PAIN WAS FROM THE SURGERY THAT THE IMPLANTS MAY NEED TO BE REPLACED, BECOME HARD AND UNCOMFORTABLE, LIKE ROCKS.|SILICONE INFLATABLE BREAST IMPLANT||06/30/1994|B|||*||16568.0|*|FWM|1.0||SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLANT|Y|||||*|UNKNOWN|||||||True

IN 1975 I HAD DOW CORNING BREAST IMPLANTS PLACED IN MY BODY FOR COSMETIC REASONS. I WAS A HEALTHY 33 YEAR OLD WOMAN. AFTER BEING TOLD IMPLANTS WERE PERFECTLY SAFE AND THAT THEY WOULD LAST A LIFE TIME I WILLINGLY SIGNED UP FOR SURGERY. WITHIN THREE MONTHS I DEVELOPED HARD CAPSULES BILATERALLY. MY SURGEON ASSURED ME ALL WAS WELL, HOWEVER HE WOULD NEED TO PERFORM A CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY IN ORDER TO SOFTEN BOTH BREASTS. I RECALL BEING FEARFUL OF THIS PROCEDURE AS A) MY SURGEON MADE ME PROMISE ""NOT TO YELL"" AND B) THERE WOULD BE NO ANESTHESIA. PROCEDURE WAS INDEED VERY PAINFUL AS HE MANUALLY APPLIED PRESSURE TO EACH BREAST AND ""CRACKED"" THEM. I FELT A TEARING SENSATION AROUND EACH BREAST. THIS WAS FIRST OF NINE CLOSED CAPSULOTOMIES, AND I SUSPECT MY LEFT IMPLANT WAS RUPTURED FROM VERY FIRST ONE. ONE YEAR AFTER IMPLANTATION I BEGAN TO HAVE PAIN IN JOINTS OF MY RIGHT HAND AND A STRANGE RASH APPEARED ON MY CHEST AND ARMS. THREE YEARS LATER I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH THYROID CANCER. WHEN I COLLECTED ALL MY MEDICAL RECORDS OVER LAST FEW YEARS I FOUND MY BIOPSY WHICH REFERRED NOT ONLY TO MY MALIGNANT TUMOR, BUT ALSO TO ""YELLOW GELATINOUS MATERIAL"" SURROUNDING MY THYROID GLAND. EVEN THOUGH MY MEDICAL RECORDS CLEARLY STATED I HAD HAD A BREAST AUGMENTATION, NO ONE AT TIME OF SURGERY MENTIONED PRESENCE OF A FOREIGN BODY MATERIAL FOUND IN MY GLAND. MY TUMOR WAS REMOVED YET AN OBVIOUSLY RUPTURED IMPLANT WAS ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN MY BODY FOR SEVERAL MORE YEARS. IT IS KNOWN THAT MOST OF MEDICAL COMMUNITY REFUSES TO ADMIT ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS AND DISEASE; HOWEVER, GIVEN THE PRESENCE OF SILICA THOUGHOUT MY THYROID GLAND AND LYMPH NODES THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND AS TO WHAT CAUSED MY CANCER. SIX YEARS AFTER IMPLANTATION MY RASH CONTINUED TO SPREAD, MY JOINTS ACHED AND MY LEFT BREAST BECAME PAINFUL AND ""HOT"" FEELING. MY LEFT NIPPLE ALSO TURNED A DARKER COLOR THAN OTHER ONE. I FELT FATIGUED, AND DISORIENTATED MOST OF TIME. I CONTINUED TO SEEK MEDICAL CARE AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS NO EXPLANATION FOR MY BODY RASH. MY PHYSICIANS COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR MY SLOW RECOVERY FROM THYROID CANCER AND ALL RELATED TREATMENTS I ENDURED. DUE TO PAIN AND CONTINUED HARDENING OF MY LEFT BREAST MY SURGEON DECIDED TO REPLACE THIS IMPLANT WITH ANOTHER DOW CORNING UNIT. AFTER SURGERY HE DID NOT TELL ME THAT EXPLANTED IMPLANT WAS RUPTURED (I LEARNED ABOUT RUPTURE WHEN COLLECTING ALL MY DATA THREE YEARS AGO). TWELVE YEARS AFTER IMPLANTATION I BEGAN TO HAVE TREMORS IN MY LEFT HAND, CHRONIC GASTRITIS, JOINT ACHE AND A ""PINS AND NEEDLES"" SENSATION IN MY LEGS AND ARMS. AT TIMES I IMAGINED SPIDERS WERE CRAWLING ON MY LEGS. FROM THIS POINT MY HEALTH WENT INTO A DOWNWARD SPIRAL AND I BECAME MORE DEPRESSED AS EACH DOCTOR'S APPT SUGGESTED SAME METHOD OF TREATMENT... SEEK MENTAL THERAPY. BY 1994, AFTER 19 YEARS OF IMPLANTS, MY HEALTH HIT ROCK BOTTOM. I WAS FATIGUED BEYOND POINT OF RECOVERY, NERVOUS, DEPRESSED AND, YES, SUICIDAL. MY BODY WOULD REACT TO SLIGHTEST STIMULANT AND I WAS HAVING SEVERE MEMORY LOSS, AND I BECAME DYSLEXIC. AT ONE POINT I WENT TO OUR LOCAL MARKET, LESS THAN A MILE FROM HOME, AND I COULDN'T REMEMBER HOW TO DRIVE HOME. I BEGAN TO LOSE MY BALANCE AND I HAD DISTORTED VISION. EVEN TODAY ONE OF MY PUPILS DOES NOT DILATE NORMALLY. I RETURNED MANY TIMES TO TRY TO FIND A CURE FOR MY RACING HEARTBEAT, MY RASH, STIFFNESS AND PAIN IN MY LIMBS, TREMOR IN MY HAND, EYE AND VAGINAL DRYNESS. AGAIN I WAS TOLD TO SEEK COUNSELING. OVER THIS PERIOD MY MARRIAGE FAILED AND I BEGAN TO THINK I WAS REALLY CRAZY. I CONSIDERED TAKING MY LIFE MANY TIMES. BY 1994 I WAS FALLING INTO A DEEP HOLE. AFTER A NEAR HEAD ON COLLISION BECAUSE I WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY DISCERNING LEFT FROM RIGHT I BEGAN TO FEAR DRIVING. MY LIFE WAS OUT OF CONTROL. AS A RESULT OF ALL MEDIA COVERAGE AROUND 1994 ON BREAST IMPLANTS I RETURNED TO MY PLASTIC SURGEON. HE TOLD ME THERE COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN MY ""IMAGINED SYMPTOMS"" AND BREAST IMPLANTS. HE DID, HOWEVER, CONCEDE THAT MY IMPLANTS ""LOOKED TERRIBLE"" DUE TO EVER PRESENT CAPSULES. HE RELUCTANTLY AGREED TO REMOVE MY IMPLANTS ON MAY 4, 1994. OF COURSE IT WAS SUGGESTED I REPLACE THEM WITH SALINE IMPLANTS WHICH I DECLINED. ONE MONTH AFTER EXPLANTATION I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BRAIN LESIONS WHICH EXPLAINS MY DIAGNOSES OF ATYPICAL MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. FOR SIX MONTHS MY SYMPTOMS SEEM TO INTENSIFY AND THEN I BEGAN TO SLOWLY IMPROVE. TODAY I LIVE WITH DISCOMFORT AND PAIN OF STIFF LEGS AND SENSATION OF SPIDERS ON MY SKIN IS STILL WITH ME. CLIMATE EXTREMES MAKES PAIN IN MY LEGS UNBEARABLE. MY MEMORY HAS IMPROVED AND I NO LONGER SUFFER, OR CAUSE OTHERS TO SUFFER, THOSE HORRIBLE AND UNPREDICTABLE MOOD SWINGS. MY CANCER IS IN REMISSION AND I AM ON MEDICATION FOR REST OF MY LIFE. MY RASH, IT APPEARS, IS WITH ME FOR LIFE. EVEN THOUGH I'VE HAD SOME IMPROVEMENT MY HEALTH HAS BEEN PERMANENTLY DAMAGED BY BREAST IMPLANTS. WHAT HAS ALL THIS MEANT TO ME? I AM ANGRY TO HAVE LOST 19 YEARS OF MY LIFE TO AVARICE AND DECEPTION OF DOW CORNING. I MOURN LOSS OF MY FIRST MARRIAGE AND I CAN'T HELP WONDERING WHAT LONG TERM HEALTH RISKS ARE FOR ME AND MY FELLOW SURVIVORS.

I WILL DO ALL THAT IS POSSIBLE TO DISCOURAGE YOUNGER WOMEN FROM PURSUING IMPLANTS BE THEY SALINE, SOY, OR WHATEVER ELSE SOME MISGUIDED SCIENTIST DREAMS UP.

BASED ON WHAT INFO WAS AVAILABLE TO HER, THE MEDICAL CONSENSUS AT THE TIME SEEMED TO BE THAT WOMEN WITH THIS PROBLEM HAD A HIGHER RATE OF BREAST CANCER COUPLED WITH A LOWER CURE RATE DUE TO THIS DIFFICULTY OF EARLY DETECTION. RPTR HAD BILATERAL SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY AND RECONSTRUCTION OF THE BREAST WITH  GEL IMPLANTS WITHOUT PATCHES ON 6/12/81 AT AGE 40. WITHIN 3 WKS RPTR COULD DETECT HARDNESS IN BOTH BREASTS. IN LESS THAN SIX MONTHS THESE WERE VERY PAINFUL AND THERE WAS MARKED CAPSULE FORMATION ON BOTH SIDES WITH SOME WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT. THROUGHOUT THIS SIX MONTH PERIOD SHE WAS TOLD TO VIGOROUSLY MASSAGE AND PULL THE IMPLANTS TO THE MIDLINE WHICH SHE DID IN SPITE OF THIS CAUSING FURTHER PAIN AS THE HARDNESS AND DEFORMITY INCREASED. ALSO AT THIS POINT THE LEFT IMPLANT HAD SHIFTED DOWN AND LATERALLY. RPTR WAS TOLD BY DR THAT HE MAY HAVE TO RELEASE THE SCAR SURGICALLY. IT WAS THEN RPTR DECIDED TO GET A SECOND OPINION. IT WAS ONLY THEN RPTR DISCOVERED THAT THE IMPLANTS WERE PLACED SUBMAMMARY NOT SUBPECTORAL AND WOULD HAVE TO BE REMOVED AND NEW IMPLANTS PLACED SUBPECTORALLY.

IN 1976 MFR'S WERE PERMITTED TO MFR AND SELL BREAST IMPLANTS BY FDA. IN THE SAME YR FDA REQUIRED MFR'S TO SHOW RESEARCHED DATA TO SUPPORT THE USE OF BREAST IMPLANTS. UNTIL THIS RESEARCH COMES OUT, WOMEN PLANNING TO USE BREAST IMPLANTS NEED TO HAVE THE FOLLOWING INFO. BEFORE SURGERY IS SCHEDULED WOMEN NEED TO DISCUSS THE PROS AND CONS OF HAVING BREAST IMPLANTS. BREAST IMPLANTS CAN IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE. PLAY AN IMPORTANT PART IN THE RECOVERY OF WOMEN DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER. SOME WOMEN FIND EXTERNAL BREAST FORMS TO BE SATISFACTORY. TISSUES FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY CAN BE USED TO RECONSTRUCT BREAST. THIS REQUIRES A LONGER OPERATION, LONGER HEALING TIME. BREAST IMPLANT SURGERIES PRESENT THE SAME RISKS AS OTHER SURGERIES, EG ANESTHESIA RELATED RISKS. BREAST IMPLANTS CAN'T BE EXPECTED TO LAST FOREVER. THEY DEFLATE, RUPTURE FOR DIFFERENT REASONS. THEY CAN DEFLATE DUE TO WEAR WITH TIME, RUPTURE DUE TO INJURY. IT IS NOT KNOWN WHEN DEFLATION OCCURS. IT HAS BEEN FOUND THROUGH RESEARCH: WHEN THE SALINE LEAKS IT IS ABSORBED IN THE BODY BECAUSE NORMAL SALINE ALREADY EXISTS IN THE BODY. BREAST IMPLANTS NEED TO BE REMOVED WHEN WORN OUT, MAKE MAMMOGRAPHY DIFFICULT, WOMAN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS RECEIVE MORE RADIATION, THE FORMALIAR OF CAPSULES AROUND THE IMPLANT CAUSES CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CALCIUM DEPOSITS NEED TO BE IDENTIFIED FROM THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH CANCER, INFECTION CAN OCCUR, ESPECIALLY WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF THE OPERATION. INFECTION WITH IMPLANTS ARE HARDER TO TREAT THAN INFECTIONS WITH NORMAL TISSUE. RISK OF HAVING A HEMATOMA: CHANCES OF OCCURRING NOT KNOWN BUT USUALLY OCCURS AFTER SURGERY. SMALL HEMATOMAS CAN BE ABSORBED BY THE BODY, BUT LARGE ONES ARE SURGICALLY DRAINED WHICH CAUSES SCARRING. RESEARCH CONTINUES TO INDICATE THAT FEELING OF PAIN, BURNING SENSTAION MAY INTERFEAR WITH BREAT FEEDING AND SEXUAL RESPONSE. MANY FEEL IMPLANT SHIFTINGS AND FEEL IMPLANT THROUGH THE SKIN. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES LIKE LUPUS, SCLERODERMA, RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND NEUROLOGIC SYMPTOMS SEEN IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PT'S. IN SOME CASES THE SALINE USED HAS BEEN KNOWN TO BE CONTAMINATED WITH BACTERIA. IF SO, ORGANISMS MAY BE RELEASED IN THE BODY IF HER IMPLANTS DEFLATE. ACCORDING TO SCIENTIFIC STUDIES WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS IN GENERAL ARE NOT AT AN INCREASED RISK FOR AUTOIMMUNE OR SELECTIVE TISSUE DISEASES. HOWEVER, THESE STUDIES ARE TOO SMALL TO DETECT WETHER THERE MIGHT BE A SLIGHTLY INCREASED RISK OF ANY OF THESE RARE DISEASES. ALSO THESE CURRENT STUDIES HAVE LOOKED ONLY FOR THE SYMPTOMS OF KNOWN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES, RATHER THAN THE VARIETY OF SYMPTOMS THAT SOME WOMEN ARE EXPERIENCING. SUCH AS SWELLING, JOINT PAIN, ARTHRITIS LIKE PAIN, GENERAL ACHING, UNUSUAL HAIR LOSS, UNEXPLAINED OR UNUSUAL LOSS OF ENERGY, GREATER CHANCE OF GETTING COLDS, VIRUSES, AND FLU SWOLLEN GLANDS OR LYMPH NODES."|ANATOMICALLY SHAPED BREAST IMPLANTS||07/22/1998|A|||*||173408.0||FWM|1.0||BREAST IMPLANTS|Y||700 WARD DR.||SANTA BARBARA|US|MCGHAN MEDICAL CORP.||CA|93111||||True

226781|18473741|D|1||"RPTR WRITES, ""AFTER HAVING MY DAUGHTER IN 6/70 I HAD PROBLEMS WITH BOTH MY BREASTS. AFTER HAVING MY SECOND DAUGHTER IN 7/71, PROBLEMS I HAD WITH BOTH MY BREASTS WERE GETTING WORSE. HAVING BEEN SEEN BY MY GENERAL PRACTITIONER, I WAS SENT FOR SCAN ON BOTH BREASTS. FIBROCYSTIC MASTITIS WAS DIAGNOSED, AND I ALSO HAD GREEN FLUID OOZING FROM BOTH NIPPLES ACCOMPANIED WITH SEVERE PAIN. THE TREATMENT I WAS ON WAS DANAZOL, BUT TO NO AVAIL. I SAW MY GENERAL PRACTITIONER AGAIN WHO THEN MADE ME AN APPOINTMENT TO SEE BREAST SURGEON. I HAD NO FURTHER SCANS THAT REVEALED I HAD FIBROCYSTIC MASTITIS; BY THAT TIME FLUID FROM BOTH MY NIPPLES HAD BECOME EMERALD GREEN COLOR, REALLY DARK GREEN, ALSO WITH PAIN BECOMING WORSE. I WAS TOLD TO WRAP HOT WATER BOTTLE IN TOWEL AND PLACE TO MY BREAST; AND I WAS GIVEN PAIN CONTROL DRUGS. I STOOD PAIN UNTIL I COULD NO MORE. IN 6/90, I SAW BREAST SURGEON AGAIN, ASKING HIM IF THERE WAS WAY HE COULD RELIEVE ME FROM TERRIBLE PAIN I WAS IN. I WAS TOLD THAT THERE COULD ONLY BE ONE SOLUTION, AND THAT WAS TO HAVE DOUBLE MASTECTOMY. HE WOULD ONLY DO IT IF I WAS TO HAVE SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. I AGREED. I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE. IN 8/89 I HAD BILATERAL ""MAMMADOCHECTOMY."" THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT EITHER, SO THAT'S WHY I ASKED FOR MASTECTOMY. I SAW BREAST SURGEON WHO REFERRED ME TO PLASTIC SURGEON, AND OPERATION WAS A JOINT ONE. THE BREAST WAS REMOVED, AND BREAST TISSUE DOWN TO MUSCLE (SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY); AND IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION WITH SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. THIS WAS CARRIED OUT IN 1990. I HAD BILATERAL SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY DEEP DOWN TO PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE, IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS IN 1990. THE IMPLANTS BECAME EXPOSED DUE TO SCARS GAPING OPEN, FLUID WAS OOZING OUT. SWABS TAKEN OF FLUID REVEALED AFTER CULTURED PLASMA (KLEBSIELLA AEROGENES). I WAS GIVEN IV 500 MG METRONIDAZOLE, TETRACYCLINE/FLUCLOXACILLIN/PAIN KILLERS TYLOX. I HAD BLOOD TRANSFUSION AND IMPLANTS REMOVED FOLLOWING DAY. I WAS TOLD WHAT HAPPENED WAS JUST A ONE IN A MILLION CHANCE OF EVER HAPPENING, AND THAT I COULD HAVE SECOND ATTEMPT OF BEING REINSERTED WITH THE BREAST IMPLANTS AFTER 8 MOS. I TOOK SURGEON'S OFFER, AND HAD SECOND ATTEMPT OF HAVING SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLANTS. AGAIN IN 1991 I HAD INSERTION OF BREAST IMPLANTS YET AGAIN. IN 1992 I ALSO HAD TO HAVE THEM REMOVED DUE TO SYSTEMIC INFECTION. IN 1997, I CAME ACROSS THE PACKAGE INSERT AND PRODUCT DATA SHEET, CLEARLY STATING THAT MASTITIS OR ANY ACTIVE INFECTION IS CONTRAINDICATED TO USE OF BREAST IMPLANTS MADE FROM SILICONE GEL. I AM SO ILL WITH FIBRO-FATTY CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDER, ACCOMPANIED WITH SEVERE PAIN, PROMINENTLY MARKED VASCULARITY, FIBROMYALGIA, CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME, HYPOTHYROIDISM, PLANTAR FASCIITIS, ARTHRITIS IN KNEES, HANDS AND BACK. I EXPERIENCE NOW SEVERE PAIN IN HANDS, FINGERS, ARMS, THIGHS, BUTTOCKS CHEEKS, HIPS, AND CALVES OF BOTH LEGS. I HAVE LOSS OF BALANCE, LOSS OF WORDS, CONCENTRATION PROBLEMS, DRY EYES, MOUTH, NOSE AND VAGINA. I ALSO HAVE A LOT OF INFECTIONS, BREATHING DIFFICULTY, BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS, THRUSH IN MOUTH/VAGINA, CHEST INFECTIONS, THROAT INFECTIONS, EAR INFECTIONS, BOWEL DISORDER, AND BLADDER PROBLEMS. I HAVE WIDESPREAD PAPILLOMAS, CHEST THROUGH ARMS AND NECK. I HAVE FIBROS TISSUE IN MY JOINTS. I ALSO HAVE PAIN IN MY HEAD; IT IS NOT A HEADACHE, IT IS LIKE WHEN INFECTION AND PUSS THROB LIKE PAIN. LOSS OF SLEEP, DROPPING THINGS, BUMPING INTO THINGS, ELECTRIC SHOCK - LIKE WHEN YOU TOUCH BARE WIRES ON ELECTRICAL GOODS, IF I TOUCH ANYTHING METAL. CRAWLING SENSATION IF I TOUCH NYLON, DRYLON, LEATHER OR POLYESTER; IF I USE TALC PERFUMED AND COLORED SOAP. I ALSO HAVE FOOD ALLERGIES. DUE TO HAVING BACTERIAL INFECTIONS I STILL EVEN TODAY TAKE METRONIDAZOLE, ANTIBIOTICS, AND ANTIFUNGAL MEDICATION TOO. I FEEL VERY WEAK, I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING CHRONIC FLU-LIKE SYMPTOMS, BUT I DON'T HAVE THE FLU. I CAN ONLY STAND, EVEN WALK SHORT PACES BEFORE BECOMING EXHAUSTED, AND MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE SEVERE PAIN I SUFFER FROM. I'M IN MY EARLY 40'S, BUT AT THIS MOMENT I FEEL LIKE 90, AND IT ISN'T RIGHT. DOCTORS I'M UNDER DON'T KNOW HOW TO BEGIN TO TREAT ME. HOWEVER, THEY KNOW WHAT CAUSE IS BUT AT THIS MOMENT CANNOT OFFER ANY KIND OF TREATMENT. I AM A TEST CASE OVER HERE OF THE DOCTORS WHO ARE DEALING WITH ME. LET'S HOPE SOMETHING CAN BE DONE PRETTY SOON. I DO BLAME SURGEONS FOR THEIR IGNORANCE AND STUPIDITY OF WAY THEY HAVE TREATED ME IN THE FIRST PLACE. TO BEGIN WITH, FOR IGNORING THE PRODUCT DATA SHEETS OF ALL BREAST IMPLANTS, ALONG WITH IGNORING THE PACKAGE INSERTS TOO. I HAVE LOST ALL TRUST AND FAITH IN MEDICAL PROFESSION. THE GOVERNMENT: FOR REFUSING TO CARRY OUT ANY KIND OF RESEARCH OR TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE LIKE ME WITH SAME ILLNESS; TREATMENT WE NEED SO DESPERATELY TO GET WELL. I KNOW I'M AS TOUGH AS NAILS. I DON'T INTEND TO SIT BACK AND DO NOTHING. I'M DETERMINED TO GET SOMEWHERE AND GET TREATMENT I SO DESPERATELY NEED. UP UNTIL 1989 I USED TO WORK FULL TIME, 16 HRS A DAY IN A CUTLERY FACTORY. I ALSO TOOK CARE OF MY MOM WHO DIED FROM TERMINAL CANCER BACK IN 1985. I ALSO TOOK CARE OF MY FATHER WHO ALSO DIED FROM A TERMINAL DISEASE. BOTH OF MY PARENTS DIED FROM CHEST ILLNESSES, MOST OF MY FATHER'S FAMILY DIED FROM TUBERCULOSIS, LUNG CANCER, HEART ATTACKS, AND STROKES. IN MY MOM'S FAMILY THEY DIED OF LUNG/BREAST CANCER ETHACENIA. THEY ALL WENT TO OPEN AIR SCHOOL. I WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS BORN IN PERFECT HEALTH, THAT IS UNTIL I MARRIED AND HAD CHILDREN AT THE AGE OF 16."" HISTORY: PT SUFFERED FROM CHRONIC BREAST PAIN FOR A PERIOD OF APPROX 20 YRS AND WHICH WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CYSTIC MASTITIS. VARIOUS CONSERVATIVE, DRUG TREATMENT REGIMES WERE TRIED TO HELP HER WITH THIS PROBLEM BUT TO NO AVAIL. SHE DESCRIBES HAVING A COLORED DISCHARGE COMING FROM HER NIPPLES IN ADDITION TO THE PAIN.

HE SAID THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE THE FORMATION OF THE SCAR TISSUE WITH THE CAPSULAR CONTRACTIONS. THIS IS HOW I WAS GIVEN A POLYURETHANE COATED IMPLANT IN MY LEFT BREAST (CANCER SIDE - MASTECTOMY). HISTORY: IN 1988 WENT TO SEE THIS PLASTIC SURGEON WHO WAS REFERRED TO ME TO SEE IF HE COULD POSSIBLY STITCH BOTH MY BREASTS UP FOR THEY HAD BECOME EMPTY SACS AFTER I STOPPED MENSTRUATING AND HIS SOLUTION WAS TO AUGMENT THEM AND AFTER CONSIDERATION HE DID AND PUT IN TWO SILICONE IMPLANTS.

ASKED MY DR IF I COULD HAVE A WRITTEN PRESCRIPTION TO HAVE A SONOGRAM PERFORMED AND I DID AND SURE ENOUGH I DID HAVE A LUMP. WENT TO SEE MY PLASTIC SURGEON AND HE REFERRED ME TO THE ONE OF THE FINEST BREAST SURGEONS. WENT TO SEE HIM FIRST OF JANUARY AND HE SCHEDULED ME FOR A BIOPSY ON 1/13/92 AND WHEN WE GOT THE REPORT BACK IT WAS CANCEROUS AND SO I WENT TO SEE HIM THE NEXT DAY AND WE DISCUSSED THE DIFFERENT PROCEDURES, ETC. AND HE BOOKED ME FOR SURGERY ON 1/21/1992. I OPTED FOR A MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY BECAUSE I DID HAVE THE SILICONE IMPLANT IN THE BREAST AND WAS DEVASTED WITH THE FACT THAT I HAD CANCER. I HAD THIS PROCEDURE AND HAD THE SAME PLASTIC SURGEON DO THE RECONSTRUCTION WITH A SALINE EXPANDER. THE VERY NEXT MORNING THE PLASTIC SURGEON TOLD ME AT THE HOSP THAT HE WAS SURE THE SALINE HAD RUPTURED AND TO CALL HIM THE FOLLOWING WEEK TO SET UP AN APPOINTMENT TO REPLACE THE SALINE, WHICH I DID. FOLLOWING THIS SALINE IMPLANT I HAD SEVERE REJECTION AND CONTRACTURES WHICH ONCE AGAIN THE IMPLANT STARTED TO MOVE UPWARDS. WENT BACK TO PLASTIC SURGEON WE DISCUSSED THE PAST IMPLANT HISTORY AND THAT THE POLYURETHANE COATED IMPLANTS SEEM TO BE THE ONLY ONES WHICH WORKED. THAT THIS WOULD BE THE ONLY OPTION BUT THAT I HAD TO SIGN A WAIVER. HE NEVER AT ANY TIME INFORMED ME OF THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OR HEALTH RISK INVOLVED WITH THESE TYPES OF IMPLANTS, BUT I HAD NO INFO FROM THE MFR OR INFO REGARDING THESE IMPLANTS NOR DID I KNOW THAT THE FDA STOPPED THE MFRS FROM MAKING THE POLYURETHANE IMPLANTS UNTIL I REQUEST THE BREAST IMPLANT, 1998 FROM THE FDA. I HAD STARTED TO HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS: SKIN RASHES, ALLERGIES, REDNESS, JOINT SWELLING AND SUSPECTED THAT THIS WAS FROM A SEVERE ALLERGY FROM POLYURETHANE COATING, ITCHNESS WITHIN BREAST ESPECIALLY MY LEFT BREAST (MASTY. BREAST). THIS WENT ON FOR OVER SIX YEARS. WENT FROM DR TO DR TO SPECIALIST BACK TO MY OWN DRS, ONCOLOGIST, INTERNIST, GYN, PLASTIC SURGEON AND GOT NO REAL INFO. ALSO HAD SEVERE PAINS IN BOTH BREASTS, CONTRACTIONS. FINALLY IN JUNE OF 1998 AFTER SEEING 11 DERMATOLOGISTS, 2 ALLERGISTS, ETC., I WENT TO SEE MY ONCOLOGIST AND ASKED FOR AN MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING BREAST TEST AND I HAD ONE DONE ON 7/2/98. RESULTS OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING STATE THAT REACTIVE FLUID CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, AND CONTAINED OTHER INFO. I HAD THESE FAXED TO ALL MY DRS, NO ONE GAVE ME ANY INFO REGARDING THIS MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING TEST. WENT AND SAW DRS ONCE AGAIN! GOT NOWHERE; TOLD THEM I THOUGHT IMPLANTS WERE CAUSE OF MY BEING ILL. RASHES, ALLERGIES ARE WORSE THAN MY RIGHT BREAST ENLARGED TO ABOUT TWO SIZES LARGER, RED RASHES, ITCHY, VEINS POPPING, EXTREME PAIN, FEVER IN LEFT BREAST, AND OTHER SYMPTOMS WERE MISSING IN RIGHT BREAST WHEN I DISCOVERED A LUMP UNDER MY RIGHT ARMPIT. CALLED MY BREAST SURGEON GOT AN APPOINTMENT 10/9/98, AND HE GAVE ME ANTIOBIOTICS BUT GAVE ME AN APPOINTMENT AT HIS MEDICAL SUITE TO HAVE A BIOPSY ON 10/14/98. HE REMOVED MY LYMPH NODE AND AFTER PATHOLOGIST REPORT CAME IN AS BENIGN. OTHER REPORTS WERE NOT IN AND I CALLED TO HAVE THEM FAX THE RESULTS AND IT SHOWED I HAD FOREIGN MATERIAL CONSISTENT WITH SILICONE AND THERE WAS A TAN FLESHY SUBSTANCE IN THE RIGHT AUXILLARY LYMPH NODE AND ALSO GIANT REACTIVE FLUID PRESENT, ETC. I FAXED THIS INFO TO MY ONCOLOGIST, PLASTIC SURGEON, WENT TO SEE THEM BUT NOTHING AS FAR AS WHAT I KNEW WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS AND THEIR CONCLUSIONS. FOUND OUT WHO WAS THE MEDICAL ADVISOR AND DIRECTOR FOR CANCER AT THE HOSP WHERE I RESIDE AND WENT TO SEE A DR ON 12/3/98 WITH MY HISTORY. HE JUST CONSULTS AND HE AFTER GOING THROUGH ALL THE PAPERS AND DOCUMENTS I BROUGHT IN CONCURRED WITH ME THAT I NEEDED TO HAVE MY IMPLANTS REMOVED AND RECOMMENDED AND SENT MY INFO TO A DR.

WENT BACK TO PLASTIC SURGEON WE DISCUSSED THE PAST IMPLANT HISTORY AND THAT THE POLYURETHANE COATED IMPLANTS SEEM TO BE THE ONLY ONES WHICH WORKED. THAT THIS WOULD BE THE ONLY OPTION BUT THAT I HAD TO SIGN A WAIVER. HE NEVER AT ANY TIME INFORMED ME OF THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OR HEALTH RISK INVOLVED WITH THESE TYPES OF IMPLANTS, BUT I HAD NO INFO FROM THE MFR OR INFO REGARDING THESE IMPLANTS NOR DID I KNOW THAT THE FDA STOPPED THE MFRS FROM MAKING THE POLYURETHANE IMPLANTS UNTIL I REQUEST THE BREAST IMPLANT, 1998 FROM THE FDA.

ALSO HAD SEVERE PAINS IN BOTH BREASTS, CONTRACTIONS. FINALLY IN JUNE OF 1998 AFTER SEEING 11 DERMATOLOGISTS, 2 ALLERGISTS, ETC., I WENT TO SEE MY ONCOLOGIST AND ASKED FOR AN MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING BREAST TEST AND I HAD ONE DONE ON 7/2/98.

211385|173276|D|1||"RPTR WRITES, ""HAVE AT PRESENT TWO UNIMED UNDERFILLED POLYURETHANE COATED PROSTHESES PRESENTLY. ONE WAS IMPLANTED IN MY LEFT BREAST ON 7/6/90 AFTER HAVING CANCER (MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY ON 1/21/92. I HAD INFILTRATING LOBULAR CARCINOMA AND HAD RECONSTRUCTION AT THE SAME TIME WITH A PLASTIC SURGEON WHO HAD DONE WORK PREVIOUSLY ON MY BREASTS. I WAS FITTED WITH A SALINE EXPANDER. THE PLASTIC SURGEON THE VERY NEXT MORNING AT THE HOSP TOLD ME HE THOUGHT IT HAD RUPTURED AND TO CALL HIM TO MAKE A DATE TO HAVE IT REPLACED AT HIS SURGICAL SUITE. I DID...HE REPLACED IT AND I STARTED TO HAVE PROBLEMS...MY BODY WAS REJECTING THE SALINE...KEPT HAVING CONTRACTURES AND STARTED TO RIDE HIGH AND WAS MOVING UPWARDS. WENT BACK TO THE PLASTIC SURGEON AND WE DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITIES AND HE SUGGESTED I HAVE IT REPLACED WITH THE SAME POLYURETHANE IMPLANT WHICH HE HAD PUT IN, ON 7/6/90, RIGHT AND LEFT BREAST AFTER TAKING THE TWO SILICONES OUT FOR THE SAME REASONS. HE SAID THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE THE FORMATION OF THE SCAR TISSUE WITH THE CAPSULAR CONTRACTIONS. THIS IS HOW I WAS GIVEN A POLYURETHANE COATED IMPLANT IN MY LEFT BREAST (CANCER SIDE - MASTECTOMY). HISTORY: IN 1988 WENT TO SEE THIS PLASTIC SURGEON WHO WAS REFERRED TO ME TO SEE IF HE COULD POSSIBLY STITCH BOTH MY BREASTS UP FOR THEY HAD BECOME EMPTY SACS AFTER I STOPPED MENSTRUATING AND HIS SOLUTION WAS TO AUGMENT THEM AND AFTER CONSIDERATION HE DID AND PUT IN TWO SILICONE IMPLANTS. IN TIME THESE STARTED TO GIVE ME PAIN AND HAD CAPSULAR CONTRACTIONS AND THEY STARTED RIDING HIGH AND THEY WERE SO SEVERE THAT HE SUGGESTED THAT WITH HIS PTS WITH THIS PROBLEM HE OPTED FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE SILICONE AND REPLACE THEM WITH 2 POLYURETHANE IMPLANTS WHICH WOULD ADHERE BETTER AND YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SUCH CONTRACTIONS. I DID THIS AND HAD THIS PROCEDURE PERFORMED AT HIS SURGICAL SUITE ON 7/2/90. SEE NOTES AT END OF HISTORY OF IMPLANTS. HAD REGULAR MAMMOGRAMS AND IN THE LATTER PART OF 1991 I WAS FEELING A LUMP IN MY LEFT BREAST EVEN THOUGH THE LATEST MAMMOGRAM DID NOT SHOW ANYTHING. I REQUESTED ANOTHER MAMMOGRAM AT A DIFFERENT LOCATION AND THIS SHOWED NOTHING. ASKED MY DR IF I COULD HAVE A WRITTEN PRESCRIPTION TO HAVE A SONOGRAM PERFORMED AND I DID AND SURE ENOUGH I DID HAVE A LUMP. WENT TO SEE MY PLASTIC SURGEON AND HE REFERRED ME TO THE ONE OF THE FINEST BREAST SURGEONS. WENT TO SEE HIM FIRST OF JANUARY AND HE SCHEDULED ME FOR A BIOPSY ON 1/13/92 AND WHEN WE GOT THE REPORT BACK IT WAS CANCEROUS AND SO I WENT TO SEE HIM THE NEXT DAY AND WE DISCUSSED THE DIFFERENT PROCEDURES, ETC. AND HE BOOKED ME FOR SURGERY ON 1/21/1992. I OPTED FOR A MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY BECAUSE I DID HAVE THE SILICONE IMPLANT IN THE BREAST AND WAS DEVASTED WITH THE FACT THAT I HAD CANCER. I HAD THIS PROCEDURE AND HAD THE SAME PLASTIC SURGEON DO THE RECONSTRUCTION WITH A SALINE EXPANDER.

THESE COMPRISE: 1. SOME CORRESPONDENCE WHICH DEMONSTRATES OUR DIFFICULTIES WITH THE MEDICAL DEVICES AGENCY (MDA). THIS GIVES A) AN EXAMPLE OF THE EVASIVE RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE NATIONAL BREAST IMPLANT REGISTRY AND B) THE LACK OF ANY REVIEW OF ORAL AND WRITTEN ACCOUNTS SENT IN TO IRG BY SILICONE CASUALTIES. THIS, WE INSIST, IS A MOST SERIOUS OMISSION SINCE THE IRG WAS, PURPORTEDLY, SET UP IN RESPONSE TO NUMBERS OF COMPLAINTS ON PROBLEMS WITH SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS. 2. QUESTIONS CONCERNING PROBLEMS WITH THE STRUCTURE AND PROCESS OF THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW GROUP (IRG). THESE QUESTIONS TO THE THEN MINISTER OF HEALTH, WHO CALLED FOR THE IRG, AND LATER MINISTER FOR WOMEN) GIVE A SUMMARY OF OUR CAUSES FOR CONCERN IN TERMS OF THE DESCRIPTION ""INDEPENDENT"" OF THE IRG. WE HAVE MATERIAL TO SUBSTANTIATE OUR COMPLAINT. WE ARE AT PRESENT OFFERING OUR EVIDENCE TO THE CHAIR FOR THE SELECT COMMITTEE FOR HEALTH IN PRESSING THE NEED FOR AN INQUIRY INTO THE REVIEWING AND MONITORING (MDA) SYSTEMS EMPLOYED TO INVESTIGATE THE 'SILICONE GEL' PROBLEM HERE. 3. EXAMPLES OF EVALUATIONS SUBMITTED BY DOCTORS TO THE IRG, BUT NOT GIVEN REFERENCE IN THE TABLE OF IRG REFERENCES. 4. MY OWN COMMENTS ON THE MDA BOOK, 'SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS AND CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE' PUBLISHED IN 1994 FROM RESEARCH UNDERTAKEN BY THE MDA. THE MDA CONDUCTED THIS RESEARCH BEFORE ITS OFFICIAL INSTALLATION AS AN AGENCY OF THE DEPT OF HEALTH. THEREFORE, WHEN ACTUAL FLESH AND BLOOD CASUALTIES TRIED TO REPORT PROBLEMS, THE MDA HAD ALREADY MADE UP ITS MIND THAT THERE WERE NO SUCH THINGS AS SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH REGARD TO SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS. A NUMBER OF US HAVE NOW SUCCEEDED IN HAVING OUR COMPLAINT AGAINST THE MDA INVESTIGATED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY OMBUDSMAN. THIS IS ON THE GROUNDS OF A) EVASIVE INFO AND B) FAILURE TO TAKE UP REPORTS OF IMPLANT RUPTURE AS ADVERSE INCIDENTS AS WRITTEN DOWN IN THE MDA FRAMEWORK DOCUMENT. FOLLOWING OUR CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT IN 1997 AND AFTER CONTINUAL LOBBYING ON BEHALF OF SILICONE IMPLANT SUFFERERS, THE IRG WAS INSTALLED TO CONDUCT ITS REVIEW. THE IRG REPORT WAS PUBLISHED IN 7/98. YOU WILL NOTE OUR MISGIVINGS ABOUT THE IRG FROM THE ENCLOSED ATTACHMENT NUMBERS 1,2,3 AND 5. PERHAPS THE MOST PROBLEMATICAL AREA FOR US HAS BEEN THE MDA INFLUENCE UPON THE IRG. THE MDA WAS EMPLOYED AS SECRETARIAT TO THE IRG, BUT IT BY FAR EXCEEDED THIS ROLE. THE MDA CAME WITH A PREDETERMINED STANCE CONTAINED IN ITS STRONGLY HELD SILICONE-GEL-SAFE VIEW. IN OTHER WORDS, THE WHOLE PROCESS WAS SET ON A BIAS. THIS WAS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW THE CONVENIENT, SHORT TERM VIEW CAN BE PASSED FROM ONE REVIEW BODY TO ANOTHER, WHILE THE TERM 'INDEPENDENT' IS REPETITIVELY USED TO DESCRIBE THESE BODIES. 5. DOSSIER OF STATISTICS DRAWN FROM MODEST DISPERSAL OF QUESTIONNAIRES. THESE WERE MODELLED ON THE MEDWATCH FORMAT. BOTH THE QUESTIONNAIRES AND THE STATISTICS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED BY OUR CAMPAIGN TO THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION (WHO). 6. DOSSIER OF RESPONSES TO THE IRG REPORT FROM DOCTORS WHO DISAGREE WITH THE RESULT. THIS SHOULD BE SELF EXPLANATORY. WE ASK THAT YOU MIGHT INCLUDE OUR SUBMISSION IN YOUR DELIBERATIONS ON THIS SERIOUS PROBLEM. STATISTICS: SURVEY CARRIED OUT ON 286 WOMEN WHO DEVELOPED ILLNESSES AFTER BEING IMPLANTED WITH SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLANTS.

DUE TO HAVING BACTERIAL INFECTIONS I STILL EVEN TODAY TAKE METRONIDAZOLE, ANTIBIOTICS, AND ANTIFUNGAL MEDICATION TOO. I FEEL VERY WEAK, I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING CHRONIC FLU-LIKE SYMPTOMS, BUT I DON'T HAVE THE FLU. I CAN ONLY STAND, EVEN WALK SHORT PACES BEFORE BECOMING EXHAUSTED, AND MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE SEVERE PAIN I SUFFER FROM. I'M IN MY EARLY 40'S, BUT AT THIS MOMENT I FEEL LIKE 90, AND IT ISN'T RIGHT. THE DOCTORS I'M UNDER DON'T KNOW HOW TO BEGIN TO TREAT ME. HOWEVER, THEY KNOW WHAT THE CAUSE IS BUT AT THIS MOMENT CANNOT OFFER ANY KIND OF TREATMENT. I AM A TEST CASE OVER HERE OF THE DOCTORS WHO ARE DEALING WITH ME. LET'S HOPE SOMETHING CAN BE DONE PRETTY SOON. I DO BLAME THE SURGEONS FOR THEIR IGNORANCE AND STUPIDITY OF THE WAY THEY HAVE TREATED ME IN THE FIRST PLACE. TO BEGIN WITH, FOR IGNORING THE PRODUCT DATA SHEETS OF ALL BREAST IMPLANTS, ALONG WITH IGNORING THE PACKAGE INSERTS TOO. I HAVE LOST ALL TRUST AND FAITH IN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. THE GOVERNMENT: FOR REFUSING TO CARRY OUT ANY KIND OF RESEARCH OR TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE LIKE ME WITH THE SAME ILLNESS; THE TREATMENT WE NEED SO DESPERATELY TO GET WELL. I KNOW I'M AS TOUGH AS NAILS. I DON'T INTEND TO SIT BACK AND DO NOTHING. I'M DETERMINED TO GET SOMEWHERE AND GET THE TREATMENT I SO DESPERATELY NEED. UP UNTIL 1989 I USED TO WORK FULL TIME, 16 HRS A DAY IN A CUTLERY FACTORY. I ALSO TOOK CARE OF MY MOM WHO DIED FROM TERMINAL CANCER BACK IN 1985. I ALSO TOOK CARE OF MY FATHER WHO ALSO DIED FROM A TERMINAL DISEASE. BOTH OF MY PARENTS DIED FROM CHEST ILLNESSES, MOST OF MY FATHER'S FAMILY DIED FROM TUBERCULOSIS, LUNG CANCER, HEART ATTACKS, AND STROKES. IN MY MOM'S FAMILY THEY DIED OF LUNG/BREAST CANCER ETHACENIA. THEY ALL WENT TO OPEN AIR SCHOOL. I WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS BORN IN PERFECT HEALTH, THAT IS UNTIL I MARRIED AND HAD CHILDREN AT THE AGE OF 16."" HISTORY: PT SUFFERED FROM CHRONIC BREAST PAIN FOR A PERIOD OF APPROX 20 YEARS AND WHICH WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CYSTIC MASTITIS. VARIOUS CONSERVATIVE, DRUG TREATMENT REGIMES WERE TRIED TO HELP HER WITH THIS PROBLEM BUT TO NO AVAIL. SHE DESCRIBES HAVING A COLORED DISCHARGE COMING FROM HER NIPPLES IN ADDITION TO THE PAIN. SHE CAME UNDER THE CARE OF A CONSULTANT GENERAL SURGEON WHO PERFORMED AN OPERATION ON HER BREAST DUCTS IN 1989.

THE SYMPTOMS PROGRESSED RAPIDLY, EACH TIME THEY WENT BACK IN, THEY USED THE SAME IMPLANTS, EVEN REFILLED THE ONE THAT LEAKED. MY MAMMOGRAMS SHOWED A BULGE, THE RADIOLOGIST ADVISED ME TO REMOVE THEM, THE PLASTIC SURGEON DENIED WHAT THE FILM SHOWED. I HAD A SONOGRAM LATER, AND IT SHOWED MY LYMPH NODES WERE SWOLLEN. THEY IDENTIFIED GEL OUTSIDE OF THE CAPSULES. MY HEALTH WAS DECLINING RAPIDLY. THE NURSES TOLD ME ABOUT THE ADVERSE EFFECTS, TWO MONTHS BEFORE THIS LITIGATION WAS TO CLOSE. I HAD TO SEE AN INTERNAL SPECIALIST, WHO DIAGNOSED ME WITH SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS, SO DID A RHEUMATOLOGIST, AND SO DID A NEUROLOGIST. I HAVE SEIZURES, CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDER, ATYPICAL LUPUS, SJOGREN'S, RAYNAUD'S, NUMEROUS OTHER CONDITIONS.

I HAVE NIGHT SWEATS, MY FACE IS GETTING A PINK RASH OVER MY NOSE. MY BRAIN HAS ELECTRIC LIGHT SHOWS, AND I WAKE UP EXHAUSTED. MY WHOLE LIFE HAS CHANGED.

WHY DID THE FDA ALLOW THIS? I THOUGHT IMPLANTS WERE SAFE, AND HAD BEEN APPROVED. NOW I'M READING I'VE BEEN TOXICALLY POISONED. I TRY TO USE MY MIND TO CONTROL PAIN. I AM ILL, I WANT TO BE WELL, I WANT TO BE FREE FROM ALL OF THE THINGS I HAVE WRONG WITH ME NOW. I TRY SO HARD, BUT I CAN'T DO THINGS. I WILL NEVER GIVE UP TRYING. I WISH I WAS WELL ENOUGH TO BE ME AGAIN NOW. I STAY AWAY FROM THE DOCTORS, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY MORE. I CAN'T HEAR WELL, AND I'M SO TIRED. I DON'T LEAD A NORMAL LIFE. I'M SICK, AND I'M JUST TRYING TO HIDE FROM ANY MORE TESTS, OR HOSPS. THESE CHEST PAINS WERE NEVER NORMAL FOR A 35 YEAR OLD LADY WHO EXERCIZED, WAS PHYSICALLY IN SHAPE. NOW I CAN'T RAISE MY ARMS, THE PAIN GOES FROM MY BREAST CLEAR DOWN TO MY FINGERTIPS. I CAN'T TELL YOU ANY MORE, IT'S TOO UPSETTING TO LOOK AT. I HAD A HYSTERECTOMY, I HEMORRHAGED FOR MONTHS. I'VE HAD A KIDNEY STONE, MY BLADDER IS BLOCKED, INFECTED ALL THE TIME, AND THEY CAN'T DO SURGERY. I HAVE A YEAST INFECTION CONTINUALLY. MY NAILS HAVE HAD A FUNGUS.

IN 2/1996 PT WENT FOR THEIR FIRST CONSULTATION WITH THE PLASTIC SURGEON. THE ONLY OTHER COMPLICATIONS THAT HE DISCUSSED WITH PT WERE THE NORMAL RISKS WITH SURGERY, INFECTION AND ANESTHESIA PROBLEMS. WHEN PT GOT THE PAPERWORK TO SIGN WITH NUMEROUS OTHER WARNINGS ON IT PT ASKED QUESTIONS AND WAS ASSURED THAT THOSE WERE ONLY BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE SILICONE -- NOT SALINE. THE OPERATION WAS SCHEDUELD. NINE MONTHS LATER HE SCHEDULED PT FOR ANOTHER OPERATION AS PT HAD DEVELOPED CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. THEY BOTH HAD TO BE REMOVED AND REINSERTED. WITH IN A FEW HOURS ONE OF PT'S IMPLANTS HAD COMPLETELY DEFLATED. PT WAS VERY SCARED AND CALLED THEIR PLASTIC SURGEON'S EMERGENCY SERVICE. PT WAS BACK IN FOR SURGERY TO HAVE THE IMPLANT REPLACED. APPARENTLY THE VALVE HAD FAILED AND LEAKED. HE SAID THAT THIS WAS VERY RARE. SHORTLY AFTER THIS PT STARTED HAVING A LOT OF HEADACHES. PT WAS TREATED FOR MIGRAINES AND ALLERGIES. THEN PT STARTED GETTING SEVERE CRAMPING AND MUSCLE SPASMS IN NECK AND SHOULDERS AND HAD TO BE PUT ON MUSCLE RELAXERS.

PT SAW NUMEROUS DRS AND WAS TREATED WITH ANTI-DEPRESSANTS AS THEY FELT THE ANXIETY WAS CAUSED BY THE CHRONIC PAIN. EVERY FLU OR VIRUS THAT COMES ALONG, PT GETS IT. THE HEADACHES WERE GETTING WORSE AND PT STARTED SEEING NEUROLOGISTS AND CHIROPRACTORS AND MASSAGE THERAPISTS, AND FINALLY A PAIN MANAGEMENT DR AS A LAST RESORT. THANKFULLY, PT DID MENTION IMPLANTS. HE THEN ASKED IF PT HAD EVER HAD A LEAK. PT STARTED RESEARCHING AND BECAME EXTREMELY TERRIFIED AFTER FINDING SEVERAL DIFFERENT WEB SITES WITH OTHER WOMEN'S BREAST IMPLANT HORROR STORIES. AFTER DOING A LOT OF SOUL SEARCHING AND RESEARCH PT DECIDED TO HAVE THEM REMOVED. PT WENT BACK TO IMPLANTING PLASTIC SURGEON TO ASK HIM TO DO IT. PT MENTIONED ALL OF THE INFO FOUND OUT AND TOLD HIM. THEY DID NOT WANT TO RISK HEALTH ANYMORE. HIS ATTITUDE COMPLETELY CHANGED AT THIS POINT. HE SAID THAT PT NEEDED TO WAIT ANOTHER 6 MONTHS AS HE WAS SURE THAT PT WOULD CHANGE THEIR MIND. PT SAID THAT THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF THEM CHANGING THEIR MIND BUT HE WOULDN'T LISTEN. PT TOLD HIM THAT THEY WERE SCARED AND WOULD GLADLY PAY FOR THE OPERATION. PT WASN'T ASKING FOR A FREEBIE. HE TREATED PT HORRIBLY SAYING THAT PT NEEDED TO BE TESTED FOR CANCER AND OTHER DISEASES AS ILLNESSES WERE PROBABLY FROM ONE OF THOSE AND HE COULDN'T OPERATE IF PT HAD CANCER. PT ASSURED HIM SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE CONVERSATION THAT THEY WOULD HAVE ALL OF THE TESTS PERFORMED THAT HE FELT NECESSARY TO RULE THOSE OUT FIRST. AT THIS POINT IN HIS OFFICE PT STARTED CRYING AND BEGGING HIM TO PLEASE PUT THEM ON HIS SCHEDULE AS HE IS PRETTY BOOKED ALL OF THE TIME AND IN THE MEANTIME PT WOULD HAVE ALL OF THE TESTING DONE HE NEEDED. HE WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM WHILE PT WAS TALKING TO HIM. PT HAD ANOTHER APPOINTMENT WITH A DIFFERENT DR. UPON SEEING HIM HE AGREED TO REMOVE THEM BASED ON PT'S FINDINGS AND SCHEDULED OPERATION.

THE IMPLANTS ONLY HAVE A TIME SPAN OF 12- TO 15 YEARS AND DO NOT LAST FOREVER. THE LAW SHOULD REQUIRE THAT THE DR'S DIAGNOSTIC REPORT INCLUDE BREAST IMPLANT COMPLICATIONS AND RUPTURES. FOR YEARS I HAVE BEEN FEELING SICK AND MY SISTER AND I HAVE HAD SOME OF THE SAME SYMPTOMS.

ONE YEAR AFTER THAT, SHE UNDERWENT DELAYED RIGHT BREAST RECONSTRUCTION UTILIZING A PEDICLE LATISSIMUS DORSI MYOCUTANEOUS FLAP.  SHE SUBSEQUENTLY UNDERWENT PLACEMENT OF A POSTOPERATIVE ADJUSTABLE IMPLANT UNDERNEATH THE LATISSIMUS FLAP LATER THAT YEAR.

IT WAS ONE OF MY BEST INVESTMENTS AND I LOVED THE WAY I LOOKED AND FELT. LAST YEAR, I WANTED TO TRY SILICONE IMPLANTS BECAUSE I HEARD THEY WERE SAFE AND MORE NATURAL FEELING. A WELL-RESPECTED TEACHING HOSP NEARBY WAS CONDUCTING A CLINICAL RESEARCH TRIAL FOR WOMEN WHO WANTED TO TRY SILICONE. IN ORDER TO QUALIFY, THERE HAD TO BE A PROBLEM WITH MY SALINE IMPLANTS. I WAS EXPERIENCING SOME WRINKLING DUE TO RECENT WEIGHT-LOSS, SO I WAS ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM. ALMOST IMEDIATLEY FOLLOWING THE SURGERY, I BECAME ILL. I HAD TAKEN MY FAMILY TO ANOTHER COUNTRY FOR THE HOLIDAYS AND I BELIEVED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS THAT I HAD PICKED UP A ""BUG"" THERE. MY SYMPTOMS CONTINUED TO WORSEN THROUGH ALL OF THIS YEAR. (DIZZINESS, FATIGUE, BLURRED VISION, SEVERE BACK PAIN, TINGLING HANDS AND FEET, RINGING IN EARS, ETC) I HAVE SPENT ALL OF 2006 IN THE OFFICES OF NEUROLOGISTS, RHEUMATOLOGISTS, PSYCHIATRISTS, MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN AND ONE NIGHT IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM. NO ONE COULD EXPLAIN WHAT WAS GOING ON, BUT THE GENERAL CONSENSUS WAS THAT I HAD FIBROMYALGIA. TEN MONTHS LATER, I NOTICED THAT MY BREASTS WERE BEGINNING TO HARDEN AND WERE VERY TENDER. I WENT TO THE PLASTI C SURGEON WHO PERFORMED THE SILICONE IMPLANT SURGERY. HE DETERMINED THAT I HAD CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. AT THE SAME TIME, I BEGAN TO RESEARCH PROBLEMS WITH SILICONE IMPLANTS. MY SYMPTOMS WERE THE SAME AS MANY WOMEN WHO RECEIVED SILICONE IMPLANTS. MY SYMPTOMS WERE ALSO CONSISTENT WITH PLATINUM POISONING. PLATINUM IS THE MATERIAL USED TO MAKE THE SILICONE IMPLANTS MORE GEL-LIKE. ONE MONTH AGO, I HAD THE SILICONE IMPLANTS REMOVED. MY HEALTH HAS IMPROVED DRAMATICALLY DURING THE PAST MONTH. MANY OF MY HEALTH ISSUES HAVE DISAPPEARED OR HAVE LESSENED CONSIDERABLY.  TWO MONTHS AGO, I BELIEVED I WAS DYING, I PRAYED FOR DIRECTION, BECAUSE I THOUGHT I HAD EXHAUSTED EVERY MEDICAL OPTION. IT WASN'T UNTIL I MADE THE CONNECTION TO THE SILICONE IMPLANTS THAT THINGS FINALLY CAME TOGETHER. BECAUSE I NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH MY 10-YEAR OLD SALINE IMPLANTS. I NEVER GUESSED THAT MY HEALTH ISSUES COULD BE CONNECTED TO MY NEW, SILICONE IMPLANTS. I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT MANY WOMEN IN SIMILAR RESEARCH STUDIES WOULD MAKE THE SAME ASSUMPTION. MANY BREAST CANCER PTS RECEIVE THE SILICONE IMPLANTS EVERY DAY. PLEASE REMIND WOMEN THAT ALL IMPLANTS ARE CONSIDERED ""FOREIGN OBJECTS"" AND ARE A POTENTIAL HEALTH RISK."|*|*|11/16/2006|*||*|*||773017.0|*|FTR|1.0||*|Y|*|*||*|*|*|||||*|*|True

IN 1993, AFTER RUPTURE WAS DETECTED THESE IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED. THE FINDINGS WERE THE CAPSULE IN THE BREAST DOES NOT CONTAIN THE LOOSE SILICONE, AS MINE HAD MIGRATED TO MY LEFT AXILLA AREA AGAIN.

IN 2002, 6 YEARS LATER, I HAD A 5.5CC CANCEROUS TUMOR REMOVED FROM THE EXACT SAME AXILLA AREA AS PRIOR. THE TUMOR HAD SILICONE IN IT, WAS CLASSIFIED AS A RARE LIPOSARCOMA.

1998794|20917661|D|1||I HAVE SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS AFTER HAVING RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY FOLLOWING A BREAST CANCER BILATERAL MASTECTOMY. AT THE END OF (B)(6) 2010, I VISITED (B)(6). THE WEATHER WAS EXTREMELY COLD, -16 DEGREES IN THE EVENINGS. AS THE DRIVE INTO THE MOUNTAINS CLIMBED IN ELEVATION FROM (B)(6), I BEGAN TO HAVE SHALLOW BREATHING. I REMAINED CLAM AND KEPT MY BREATHING SLOW TO AVOID PANIC. WHEN I GOT OUT OF THE CAR, MY MOVEMENTS WERE EXTREMELY SLOW AND RESTRICTED. I FELT IT NECESSARY TO PAY ATTENTION TO MY BREATH, THE SHALLOWNESS WAS VERY PRESENT WITH HEAVINESS IN MY CHEST, AND I COULD NOT FILL MY LUNGS AS I NORMALLY COULD. THROUGHOUT THE NEXT TWO DAYS, I WAS RESTRICTED IN MOVEMENT IN THAT I COULD NOT BREATHE TO COMPLETE NORMAL DAILY TASKS. WALKING ACROSS THE ROOM CAUSED ME TO STOP AND CATCH MY BREATH. MY FAMILY AND I TREATED THIS SYMPTOM AS ALTITUDE SICKNESS. I HAVE NEVER HAD ALTITUDE SICKNESS WITH ANY PRIOR VISITS TO (B)(6). MY LAST VISIT WAS (B)(6) 2010 WITH NO SYMPTOMS WHAT SO EVER. I CONTEMPLATED, MANY TIMES, IF I SHOULD GO TO THE ER BUT KEPT FAITH IN THAT IT WOULD SUBSIDE BY DRINKING WATER AS IF IT REALLY WERE ALTITUDE SICKNESS. AS INTENSE HEADACHE DEVELOPED THAT ENVELOPED MY ENTIRE CRANIUM. I DO NOT HAVE ISSUES WITH HEADACHES, CERTAINLY NOT ONE THIS INTENSE. I FELT HANDICAPPED. I AM NOT HANDICAPPED. I AM A NORMALLY FUNCTIONING HEALTHY CAPABLE WOMAN WHOSE BREATH WAS COMPROMISED BY PRESSURE IN THE CHEST. MY IMPLANTS WERE TIGHTER THAN NORMAL, LARGER AS IF THEY WERE SWOLLEN. ON THE DRIVE BACK TO (B)(6), THERE WAS A POINT WHERE MY BREATH RETURNED TO NORMAL. IT WAS ABOUT THE SAME AREA WHERE IT WAS SHORTENED ON THE WAY UP. TO SAY I WAS RELIEVED I COULD BREATHE NORMALLY AGAIN IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. A SHORT WHILE LATER, I NOTICED A LOUD SLOSHING SOUND IN MY IMPLANTS. THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED SINCE THEY WERE PUT IN (B)(6) 2007. THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT WOULD RESULT IN A LOUD PROMINENT SLOSHING SOUND THAT COULD BE HEARD BY OTHERS IN THE ROOM. THEIR FORM REMAINED NORMAL. I COULDN'T TELL IF THE NOISE WAS COMING FROM INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF THE IMPLANT. THE SKIN AROUND THE IMPLANT SEEMED NORMAL AS WELL. I WAS UP ALL NIGHT EVALUATING IF THEY WERE LEAKING OR NOT. I FOUND IT ODD THAT THEY WOULD BOTH LEAK BUT THE NOISES CAME EQUALLY FROM BOTH SIDES. WITHIN A 24 HOUR TIME SPAN, THE NOISES WERE JUST ABOUT GONE. THERE ISN'T A DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT MY IMPLANTS REACTED TO THE INTENSE COLD AND THE ELEVATION OF THE AREA I VISITED. I CANNOT RETURN TO (B)(6) IN FEAR THIS WILL HAPPEN AGAIN.

DEFLATION CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO DEFLATE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS; FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL; EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED); TRAUMA; COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING; AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE.

DEVICE LABELING: BASED ON INFORMATION TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGAN'S AND OTHER MANUFACTURER'S BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. THERE WERE 9 PRIMARY AUGMENTATION PATIENTS (1.9%) WITH A NEW DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER THROUGH 10 YEARS IN THE ALLERGAN PIVOTAL STUDY. IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION PATIENTS, THERE WAS 1 REPORT OF SKIN CANCER AND 1 REPORT OF RENAL CELL CANCER, AND 1 PRIMARY AUGMENTATION PATIENT WHO WAS PREGNANT AT THE TIME OF IMPLANTATION GAVE BIRTH TO A CHILD WHO LATER DEVELOPED HISTIOCYTOSIS. THERE WAS 1 REVISION-AUGMENTATION PATIENT (0.8%) WITH A NEW DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER THROUGH 10 YEARS AND 1 PATIENT REPORT OF BLADDER CANCER AND 1 PATIENT REPORT OF MULTIPLE MYELOMA. THERE WERE 17 RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS (7.6%) WITH RECURRENCE OF BREAST CANCER THROUGH 10 YEARS, 1 REPORT OF NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA AND 1 REPORT OF UTERINE CANCER. THERE WERE NO REVISION-RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS WHO REPORTED A RECURRENCE OF BREAST CANCER THROUGH 10 YEARS AND NO REPORTS OF OTHER CANCERS IN REVISION-RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. ONE RECONSTRUCTION PATIENT IN THE PIVOTAL STUDY WAS REPORTED WITH ALCL THROUGH 10 YEARS. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. LITERATURE REPORTS HAVE ALSO BEEN MADE ASSOCIATING SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS WITH VARIOUS RHEUMATOLOGICAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS SUCH AS FATIGUE, EXHAUSTION, JOINT PAIN AND SWELLING, MUSCLE PAIN AND CRAMPING, TINGLING, NUMBNESS, WEAKNESS, AND SKIN RASHES.|STYLE 410 COHESIVE SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|MF-410335|04/16/2015||02/25/2013|DA|Y|Y||0HP|FTR|1.0|02/02/2011|nan||1223847|||ARKLOW, COUNTY WICKLOW|EI|ALLERGAN|||||||True

IN 1990 I HAD A LEFT BREAST RECONSTRUCTED AFTER A MASTECTOMY IN 1989. I HAD ONLY ONE TROUBLE-FREE YEAR WITH THE MENTOR BECKER PROSTHESIS. I COMPLAINED OFTEN TO MY PS DOCTOR THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS CAUSING SEVERE ITCHING, CHANGING SHAPE AND MAKING LUMPY SPOTS ON MY TORSO. IN 2002, I HAD XRAYS SHOWING ALL THE SALINE HAD LEAKED OUT AND THE SILICONE WAS LEAKING INTO THE BROKEN SALINE BAG. THE PS AGREED TO TAKE IT OUT, BUT WANTED TO REPLACE IT WITH A DIFFERENT KIND, A MENTOR SALINE PRODUCT. I WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A QUICK SURGERY AND GO HOME THAT DAY; INSTEAD, THE SURGERY TOOK FOUR HOURS, I SPENT SEVERAL PAINFUL DAYS IN THE HOSPITAL AND A WEEK AT HOME OFF WORK. I WAS TOLD THAT THE SILICONE IMPLANT HAD BROKEN IN MY CHEST WALL AND IT HAD TO BE CLEANED AND WASHED OUT. IN 2008, MY HEALTH STARTED A FAST DETERIORATION. DURING THE NEXT FEW YEARS MY GP DOCTOR BEGAN TO RUN VARIOUS TESTS ON ME AND SAW A PATTERN. I WAS HAVING IMMUNE SYSTEM PROBLEMS, AND MANY TESTS THAT HAD BEEN OK BEGAN TO BE OFF NORMAL. HE KNEW THAT I HAD THAT NEW BREAST IMPLANT AFTER THE FIRST ONE RUPTURED. WHEN THE ANA LUPUS TEST WAS POSITIVE AND SEVERAL RELATED TESTS WERE BAD, HE TOLD ME HE THOUGHT I SHOULD SEE A RHEUMATOLOGIST. BOTH DOCTORS TOLD ME TO HAVE THE IMPLANT REMOVED. I WENT TO SEE MY PLASTIC SURGEON ONLY TO FIND OUT HE WAS MOVING TO ANOTHER STATE AND SEMI-RETIRING. HE ALSO SAID AFTER MY SURGERY HE NO LONGER WORKED WITH SILICONE IMPLANTS. HE INTRODUCED ME TO A NEW PLASTIC SURGEON WHO TAUGHT AT THE MEDICAL SCHOOL. I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH HER TO SEE IF SHE WOULD REMOVE MY IMPLANT AND TOLD HER ABOUT MY MEDICAL PROBLEMS. SHE SAID THERE WAS NO HARD EVIDENCE THAT BREAST IMPLANTS CAUSED THEM AND CONVINCED ME I SHOULD THINK ABOUT HOW MY BODY WOULD LOOK WITHOUT THE IMPLANT. I WENT HOME AND TRIED TO DEAL WITH MY HEALTH PROBLEMS, AND SAW MY RHEUMATOLOGIST. MY TESTS WERE GETTING WORSE, I BARELY WALKED WITH A CANE, MY EYES AND GUMS WERE INFECTED, MY JOINTS WERE INFLAMED, MY HAIR WAS FALLING OUT AND MY SKIN WAS PUFFY. HE TOLD ME I NEEDED TO GET THE IMPLANT TAKEN OUT SOON BECAUSE EVEN A LITTLE BIT OF SILICONE LIKE THE COVER OF THE IMPLANT WOULD WORSEN THE AUTOIMMUNE RESPONSE OF MY BODY. I WENT BACK TO THE NEW PLASTIC SURGEON, BUT THIS TIME I SHOWED HER I SHOWED HER MY OFFICIAL HOSPITAL SURGERY REPORTS. AFTER SHE SAW THEM, SHE LOOKED UP SOME MORE ABOUT IT AND FOUND THAT MY FIRST IMPLANT WAS SO BADLY RUPTURED THAT THE SURGEONS COULDN'T GET ALL OF IT AND EVEN THE BACK PORTION OF THE FIRST IMPLANT WAS STILL STUCK TO MY CHEST WALL OVER MY HEART. SHE EXPLAINED HOW DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE TO GET THAT OUT, BUT SHE COMPLETELY CHANGED HER MIND ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE RUPTURE AND SILICONE ON MY HEALTH. SHE PRESCRIBED A BREAST SURGEON AND AN MRI, WHICH SHOWED SILICONE MIGRATED ALL OVER MY MID, LEFT, AND SIDE TORSO AND THE WHOLE BACK OF THE IMPLANT WAS STUCK TO MY RIBS, AND THE SALINE CAPSULE HAD RUPTURED. MY IMMUNE SYSTEM HAD BUILT A SCAR TISSUE WALL AROUND IT TRYING TO GET RID OF IT ALL. LONG STORY SHORT: I HAD A SIX HOUR SURGERY (B)(6) 2012 WITH TWO SURGEONS AND TWO RESIDENT PS'S, FOR AN EXPLANTATION AND MASTECTOMY OF MY RIGHT BREAST. THEY CLEANED OFF ALL THE SILICONE THEY COULD FIND INCLUDING THE BACK PIECE OF THE IMPLANT OVER MY HEART. MY PS WAS SMILING WHEN SHE CAME IN TO TELL ME THE GOOD NEWS. I DON'T THINK SHE WILL EVER TELL ANOTHER WOMAN THAT THERE IS NO CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SILICONE IMPLANT AND HEALTH CONCERNS. MY HEALTH STARTED IMPROVING IMMEDIATELY BUT NOT THE OSTEOPOROSIS IN MY HIPS NOR MY JOINTS. I'VE HAD BOTH HIPS REPLACED AND STILL HAD ANA POSITIVE TESTS. I'M TOLD I HAD THE SILICONE IN MY SYSTEM TOO LONG. I LOST MORE THAN TEN YEARS OF A ONCE HEALTHY LIFE TO SILICONE POISONING. PS: I WAS NEVER COMPENSATED IN ANY WAY FOR THE BROKEN IMPLANTS AND WAS NOT AWARE OF ANY CLASS ACTION SUITS.|BECKER PROSTHESIS AND SALINE IMPLANT||08/10/2015||||*|R||I|FWM|0.0||BECKER PROSTHESIS AND SALINE IMPLANT|||||||MENTOR|||||||True

AN UPDATE TO OUR SAFETY DATABASE FOR THIS REPORTED EVENT NOTES THAT THE TERM CODE HAS BEEN CHANGED FROM CANCER TO LYMPHOMA-ALCL DUE TO INCREASED SPECIFICITY. SEROMA WAS REPORTED AT THAT TIME ALSO. DEVICE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. CALCIUM DEPOSITS CAN FORM IN THE TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT WITH SYMPTOMS THAT MAY INCLUDE PAIN AND FIRMNESS. LYMPHADENOPATHY HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED IN SOME WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS. BASED ON INFO REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGAN'S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERS' BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MUFTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. USE CARE IN SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURES SUCH AS OPEN CAPSULOTOMY, BREAST POCKET REVISION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA ASPIRATION, AND BIOPSY/LUMPECTOMY TO AVOID DAMAGE TO THE IMPLANT SHELL OR VALVE. ANY POSTOPERATIVE EVACUATION OF HEMATOMA OR SEROMA MUST BE CONDUCTED WITH CARE TO AVOID BREAST IMPLANT CONTAMINATION, OR DAMAGE FROM SHARP INSTRUMENTS. THE USE OF MICROWAVE DIATHERMY IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST IMPLANTS IS NOT RECOMMENDED, AS IT HAS BEEN REPORTED TO CAUSE TISSUE NECROSIS, SKIN EROSION, AND EXTRUSION OF THE IMPLANT. ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE IN VIVO EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. PATIENTS SHOULD BE INFORMED THAT DISSATISFACTION WITH COSMETIC RESULTS RELATED TO SUCH THINGS AS SCAR DEFORMITY, HYPERTROPHIC SCARRING, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, INCORRECT SIZE, AND IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY MAY OCCUR. CAREFUL SURGICAL PLANNING AND TECHNIQUE CAN MINIMIZE, BUT NOT PRECLUDE, THE RISK OF SUCH RESULTS. PRE-EXISTING ASYMMETRY MAY NOT BE ENTIRELY CORRECTABLE. REVISION SURGERY MAY BE INDICATED TO MAINTAIN PATIENT SATISFACTION BUT CARRIES ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS AND RISKS.

PATIENT IDENTIFIER (B)(6) RELATES TO PATIENTS' RECORD PREVIOUSLY EXISTING IN (B)(6) DATABASE. CURRENT DATABASE PATIENT IDENTIFIER IS PR: (B)(6). DEVICE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. CALCIUM DEPOSITS CAN FORM IN THE TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT WITH SYMPTOMS THAT MAY INCLUDE PAIN AND FIRMNESS. LYMPHADENOPATHY HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED IN SOME WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS. THE NATRELLE CORE STUDY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE LONG-TERM (10 YEARS) SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, ALLERGAN HAS INITIATED A SEPARATE LARGE 10-YEAR POST-APPROVAL STUDY (THE BREAST IMPLANT FOLLOW-UP STUDIES, OR BIFS) TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC ISSUES WHICH ALLERGAN'S CORE STUDY WAS NOT DESIGNED TO FULLY ANSWER, AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE A REAL-WORLD ASSESSMENT OF SOME ENDPOINTS. THE ENDPOINTS IN THE BIFS LARGE POST-APPROVAL STUDY INCLUDE LONG-TERM LOCAL COMPLICATIONS, CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE (CTD), CTD SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS, NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE, NEUROLOGICAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS, OFFSPRING ISSUES, REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES, LACTATION ISSUES, CANCER, SUICIDE, MAMMOGRAPHY ISSUES, AND MRI COMPLIANCE AND RESULTS. ALLERGAN WILL UPDATE THEIR LABELING ON A REGULAR BASIS WITH THE RESULTS OF THESE TWO STUDIES. THERE WAS 1 PRIMARY AUGMENTATION PATIENT WITH A NEW DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER THROUGH 7 YEARS IN THE CORE STUDY. THERE WAS A 13% BENIGN BREAST DISEASE RATE AND A 1% MALIGNANT BREAST DISEASE RATE. FOR REVISION-AUGMENTATION PATIENTS, THERE WAS 1 PATIENT WITH A NEW DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER. THERE WAS A 15% BENIGN BREAST DISEASE RATE AND A 1% MALIGNANT BREAST DISEASE RATE THROUGH 7 YEARS. IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION PATIENTS THERE WAS 1 REPORT OF THYROID CANCER AND 1 REPORT OF BRAIN CANCER. THERE WERE NO REPORTS OF OTHER CANCERS, SUCH AS RESPIRATORY OR CERVICAL/VULVAR, IN REVISION-AUGMENTATION PATIENTS. THERE WERE 8 PRIMARY RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS (8%) WITH NEW REPORTS OF BREAST CANCER THROUGH 7 YEARS IN THE CORE STUDY. THERE WAS A 17% BENIGN BREAST DISEASE RATE AND A 10% MALIGNANT BREAST DISEASE RATE THROUGH 7 YEARS.

5306250|33911734|D|1||"TWENTY YEARS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE CONTENTIOUSNESS AND CONFUSION BEGAN TO DOMINATE THE ISSUE OF SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANTS. IN EARLY 1992, THE WORLD LITERATURE ON THIS TOPIC COULD BE SUMMED UP IN ONE SENTENCE: SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANTS, WHEN INSERTED INTO A LIVE HUMAN BEING, HAD THE CAPACITY TO MAKE THE RECIPIENT ILL. THE LITERATURE DID NOT SPECIFICALLY STATE THAT THE ILLNESS WAS, NOR DID IT DEDUCE WITH CERTAINTY THAT THERE EVEN WAS SUCH AS ILLNESS. SUBSEQUENTLY THERE TRANSPIRED A GRIEVOUS AND FUNDAMENTAL ERROR IN REASONING: SILICONE-INDUCED DISEASE WAS DEFINED IN THE COURTROOM BEFORE IT WAS ADEQUATELY STUDIED IN THE EXAM ROOM. STATED MORE SIMPLY, PLAINTIFF AND DEFENSE LAWYERS WENT TO THE RHEUMATOLOGY TEXTBOOK, LISTED THE CRITERIA FOR CLASSICAL CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE (LUPUS, ETC.), AND FORGED A GLOBAL CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT STATING THAT IF ANYONE BECAME ILL WITH SUCH A DISORDER THEY WOULD BE COMPENSATED. A FEW OTHER CATEGORIES WERE DEFINED FOR THE STRAGGLERS, NAMELY ""ATYPICAL CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE"" AND ""ATYPICAL NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE,"" WHOSE CRITERIA WERE ALSO BASED ON A PRECONCEIVED IDEA OF HOW THE WOMEN WERE SUPPOSED TO BECOME ILL. THE STAGE WAS NOW SET FOR CHAOS, WHICH ENSUED SHORTLY THEREAFTER AS A RESULT. OF THREE EVENTS: INSTEAD OF 400,000 SHOWED UP; THERE WAS A TIMETABLE TO GET ALL OF THE WOMEN EXAMINED (BY AUGUST OF 1994); AND THE LEGAL DEFINITION OF SILICONE TOXICITY BECAME ADOPTED AS THE MEDICAL DEFINITION. EXAMINATIONS OF BREAST IMPLANT RECIPIENTS WERE INVARIABLY GEARED TOWARD GATHERING JUST ENOUGH INFO TO PLACE WOMEN ON A LEGAL COMPENSABLE GRID. STATED ANOTHER WAY, THE DISORDER WAS STUDIED FOR WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE RATHER THAN FOR WHAT IT WAS. BY FAILING TO CONSIDER MULTIPLE POTENTIAL MECHANISMS OF DISEASE CAUSATION, DATABASES WERE ARTIFICIALLY TRUNCATED AND ONLY A FRACTION OF THE WOMEN'S AILMENTS WERE RECORDED. A FURTHER LEAP OF FAITH TRANSPIRED WHEN IT WAS ASSUMED THAT THE INFLAMMATION MANIFESTED IN THE LOCAL BREAST MILIEU WOULD INVARIABLY PRECIPITATE AND BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SYSTEMIC PHENOMENA. SOONER OR LATER, ALONG THE WAY, THE IMMUNOLOGISTS WOULD BAIL EVERYONE OUT BY COMING UP WITH THE PROPER DIAGNOSTIC TESTS. THIS ABERRANT AND CONTRIVED METHODOLOGY PERMEATED THE THOUGHT PROCESSES OF NEARLY ALL INVESTIGATORS, YIELDING THE DUBIOUS DISTINCTION FOUR YEARS LATER OF HAVING OVER 200,000 WOMEN EXAMINED AND VERY LITTLE USEFUL DATA (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ESCALATING REPORTS OF DEVICE RUPTURE). ONCE THE ILLNESS WAS DEFINED BY ATTORNEYS ON A FICTITIOUS BASIS, IT WAS A SIMPLE MATTER FOR IMPLANT MFRS TO FUND STUDIES TO SHOW THAT THE FICTITIOUS ILLNESS DIDN'T EXIST. THIS PROVED VERY EFFECTIVE IN THE PUBLIC ARENA VIA A SIMPLE SLIGHT-OF-HAND ILLUSION: IF A SICK BREAST IMPLANT RECIPIENT DOESN'T HAVE ""A"" (SOMETHING IN THE TEXTBOOK), THEN SHE DOESN'T HAVE ""B"" (SOMETHING NEW), I. E., SHE HAS NOTHING. THIS SERVED TO HEIGHTEN THE VOCIFEROUS EFFORTS OF THE BREAST IMPLANT RECIPIENTS THEMSELVES, BECAUSE NOW THEY FELT VICTIMIZED TWICE: ONCE BY A FAULTY PRODUCT THAT MADE THEM ILL, AND SECOND BY CLEVER MANIPULATION OF MISLEADING DATA. LITTLE DID THEY REALIZE THAT MEDIA COVERAGE WOULD CIRCUITOUSLY COME BACK TO HAUNT THEM WHEREBY WOMEN WERE BLAMED FOR INVENTING THE ILLNESS AFTER HEARING ABOUT IT. SYMPATHETIC INVESTIGATORS WERE BESIEGED BY AN ARMY OF COMPANY RESEARCHERS WHO CONDUCTED CRITICAL AND SCATHING REVIEWS OF THE THEORIES AND PREMISES OF SILICONE-INDUCED IMMUNE ACTIVATION. THE TRASHING OF IMMUNOTOXIC MECHANISMS PARALLELED THE VACUUM CREATED BY THE LACK OF CAREFUL AND METICULOUS BEDSIDE OBSERVATIONS, RENDERING DISEASE VERIFICATION ELUSIVE. PLAINTIFF'S LAWYERS BEGAN REELING FORM A SUCCESSION OF ADVERSE JURY VERDICTS, AND WERE LEFT WONDERING WHY THEIR ""SCIENCE"" WASN'T YIELDING BETTER RESULTS. THE FINAL NAILS IN THE COFFIN WERE PROVIDED BY NUMEROUS ERUDITE SCIENTIFIC PANELS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, (B)(6), ALL OF WHOM DEDUCED THAT NOT ENOUGH DATA WAS PRESENT TO REACH ANY DEFINITIVE CONCLUSION ON CAUSATION. THE CURRENT CRISIS DEVELOPING SIMULTANEOUSLY IN MANY COUNTRIES OVER THE ISSUE OF SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANTS HAS THREE COMPONENTS, ALL APPARENTLY LINKED TO DEVICES MANUFACTURED BY POLY IMPLANT PROTHESE (A COMPANY KNOWN AS PIP): AN UNUSUALLY HIGH RATE OF RUPTURE, THE SUBSTITUTION OF SUBSTANDARD ""INDUSTRIAL GRADE"" SILICONE FOR CONVENTIONAL ""MEDICAL GRADE"" SILICONE, AND THE POTENTIAL PROPENSITY TO PRODUCE A RARE FORM OF CANCER KNOWN AS ANAPLASTIC LARGE-CELL LYMPHOMA. WITH REGARD TO RUPTURE, IT WOULD NOT BE SURPRISING IN THE FUTURE TO DISCOVER THAT DEVICES FROM ANY MFR WERE READILY FAILING AT THE RATE OF FIVE PERCENT PER YEAR. WITH REGARD TO CANCER, A DISCUSSION OF THAT ISSUE IS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THIS EDITORIAL."|DEVICE - SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT||11/17/2015||||*|*||I|FTR|1.0||DEVICE - SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|||||||POLY IMPLANT PROTHESE (PIP)|||||||True

THE REPORTER OF THE EVENT WAS ASKED TO RETURN THE PRODUCT FOR ANALYSIS. ALLERGAN HAS NOT RECEIVED THE PRODUCT AT THIS TIME. THEREFORE NO ANALYSIS OR TESTING HAS BEEN DONE. IF THE DEVICE IN QUESTION WAS MANUFACTURED BY ALLERGAN, THE FOLLOWING DEVICE LABELING WOULD APPLY: ""PUBLISHED STUDIES INDICATE THAT BREAST CANCER IS NO MORE COMMON IN WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS THAN THOSE WITHOUT IMPLANTS. A LARGE, LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP FOUND NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE RISK RATES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CANCERS, INCLUDING STOMACH CANCER, LEUKEMIA, AND LYMPHOMA. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL."""|UNK SALINE IMPLANT|UNK SALINE IMPLANT|06/09/2016||||N|R||0HP|FWM|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||NI|||||UNKNOWN MANUFACTURER|||||||True

5761253|48540699|D|1||I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER IN MY RIGHT BREAST IN (B)(6) 2010. I CONTACTED A BREAST CANCER SURGEON AND SHE TOLD ME I NEEDED TO HAVE A MASTECTOMY SINCE THERE WERE 2 TUMORS IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF MY BREAST. I ALSO CONTACTED A RECONSTRUCTIVE/PLASTIC SURGEON. I AGREED TO HAVE AN IMPLANT PUT IN AT THE SAME TIME AS MY SURGERY. THE PLASTIC SURGEON PUT IN A TISSUE EXPANDER FOR THREE MONTHS AND ON (B)(6) 2011, I HAD AN ALLERGAN TEXTURED BREAST IMPLANT PUT IN. THE STYLE OF THE IMPLANT HAD NOT BEEN APPROVED BY THE FDA YET, SO I SIGNED A CONSENT FORM TO BE PART OF A STUDY. I READ THE AGREEMENT THOROUGHLY AND THERE WERE ONLY TWO POSSIBLE RISKS: INFECTION OR COMPARTMENT CONTRACTURE. THERE WAS NO MENTION OF LYMPHOMA CANCER. APPROXIMATELY 2 YEARS LATER THE FDA APPROVED THIS STYLE IMPLANT AND THE STUDY WAS ENDED. ON (B)(6) 2016 MY RIGHT BREAST BECAME TIGHT AND HARD. IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS IT BECAME LARGER AND LARGER. I CONTACTED MY PLASTIC SURGEON AND SHE ASKED ME TO TAKE A PICTURE OF MY BREAST AND SEND TO HER, SINCE I WAS OUT OF TOWN AT THE TIME. SHE ORDERED AN ANTIBIOTIC AND MADE AN APPOINTMENT FOR ME TO SEE HER THE FOLLOWING WEEK. I WENT TO SEE HER AND SHE TOOK MORE PICTURES AND TOLD ME IT WAS PROBABLY AN INFECTION AND I SHOULD CONTINUE ANTIBIOTIC. MY BREAST GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER AND MY SURGEON DECIDED TO REMOVE MY IMPLANT. DURING THE SURGERY SHE TOOK A TISSUE SAMPLE AND THEN PUT IN A NEW TEXTURED IMPLANT AND CLOSED UP INCISION. ON (B)(6), THE PATHOLOGY REPORT CAME BACK WITH THE DIAGNOSIS OF ALCL. IT WAS CONFIRMED BY A PET CT SCAN. MY SURGEON SAID THAT SHE KNEW THE DOCTOR WHO SPECIALIZED IN ALCL AND THAT HE WAS AT THE (B)(6). MY HUSBAND AND I FLEW TO (B)(6) TO HAVE IMPLANT AND SURROUNDING SCAR TISSUE REMOVED BY THE SURGEONS WHO ARE THE AUTHORITY ON THIS DISEASE. ALSO, THE RESEARCH ON THIS DISEASE IS BEING DONE BY A TEAM THERE. THEY HAVE SEEN MOST OF THE DIAGNOSED CASES IN THE US. I HAD OTHER TESTS DONE THERE: AN ULTRASOUND AND A CHEST X-RAY. I SPOKE WITH THE DOCTOR AND HE TOLD ME THAT THE LYMPHOMA WAS ONLY IN THE FLUID SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT AND NOT IN THE SCAR TISSUE (CAPSULE) OR IN MY LYMPH NODES. I HAD THE SURGERY ON (B)(6) 2016 AND WAS INFORMED THAT ALL OF THE CANCER CELLS WERE REMOVED AND I WAS NOW CANCER FREE. I DECIDED TO HAVE A SMOOTH SILICONE IMPLANT PUT IN DURING THE SURGERY RATHER THAN COME BACK LATER FOR ADDITIONAL RECONSTRUCTION. THE DOCTOR TOLD ME THAT NONE OF THE ALCL CASES HAD EVER INVOLVED A SMOOTH IMPLANT.

DEVICE LABELING: RUPTURE - GEL IMPLANTS MAY RUPTURE, AND SALINE OR GEL/SALINE IMPLANTS MAY DEFLATE AT ANY TIME AND REQUIRE REPLACEMENT OR REVISION SURGERY. AS RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN CLINICALLY SILENT, A RADIOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT MAY BE REQUIRED TO AID DIAGNOSIS. LONG TERM ALLERGAN POST-MARKET SURVEILLANCE DATA OVER FOURTEEN YEARS ON SINGLE LUMEN AND DOUBLE LUMEN GEL/SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS INDICATES A RUPTURE RATE BETWEEN 0.37%-1.09%. ALLERGAN US CLINICAL STUDY DATA ON GEL IMPLANTS INDICATES A RUPTURE RATE BETWEEN 7.7%-9.7% AT 10 YEARS. GEL DIFFUSION - MINUTE QUANTITIES OF SILICONE MAY DIFFUSE THROUGH THE ELASTOMER ENVELOPE OF GEL-FILLED IMPLANTS. THE DETECTION OF SMALL QUANTITIES OF SILICONE IN THE PERIPROSTHETIC CAPSULE, AXILLARY LYMPH NODES, AND OTHER DISTAL REGIONS IN PATIENTS WITH APPARENTLY UNRUPTURED, CONVENTIONAL GEL-FILLED IMPLANTS HAS BEEN REPORTED IN THE MEDICAL LITERATURE. HOWEVER, THERE HAS BEEN ONLY LIMITED EVIDENCE IN MEDICAL LITERATURE ASSOCIATING GEL DIFFUSION WITH LOCAL COMPLICATIONS IN BREAST IMPLANT PATIENTS. IF SIGNIFICANT GEL DIFFUSION OCCURS, THE DEVICE SHOULD BE CHECKED FOR ANY POSSIBLE LEAKAGE OR FLAWS. RESEARCH ON SILICONE IMPLANTS - IN 1999, AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW FORM A COMMITTEE AT THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE IN THE US REPORTED THAT CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDERS, CANCER, NEUROLOGICAL DISEASES OR OTHER SYSTEMIC COMPLAINTS OR CONDITIONS ARE NO MORE COMMON IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS THAN IN WOMEN WITHOUT IMPLANTS. THEY CONCLUDED THAT A REVIEW OF THE TOXICOLOGY STUDIES OF SILICONES AND OTHER SUBSTANCES KNOWN TO BE IN BREAST IMPLANTS DOES NOT PROVIDE A BASIS FOR HEALTH CONCERNS.|UNK GEL BREAST IMPLANT|UNK GEL BREAST IMPLANT|12/08/2016||||*|*||0HP|FTR|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||NI|||||UNKNOWN MANUFACTURER|||||||True

5369613|36250016|D|1||CIRCA 1996, I UNDERWENT A BI-LATERAL MASTECTOMY FOR CANCER WITH IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION. AFTER EXPANDERS WERE USED, MENTOR SILTEX IMPLANTS (SILICONE GEL) WERE INSERTED. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A PHYSICALLY ACTIVE PERSON. I WAS A CLASSICAL BALLET DANCER ON A PROFESSIONAL TRACK. SINCE THE AGE OF 11, I DANCED IN A COMPANY, AND LATER, MOVED INTO TEACHING BALLET FOR A COMPETITIVE GYMNASTICS TEAM. OVER THE YEARS SINCE RECEIVING IMPLANTS MY HEALTH HAS STEADILY DECLINED AND ALL SYMPTOMS HAVE CONSISTENTLY WORSENED. THEY HAVE COME TO A HEAD DURING THE LAST 2 TO 3 YEARS. THE WORST PART OF THAT DECLINE IS SEVERE, DEBILITATING FATIGUE WITH SEVERE PAIN AND INJURY WITH ANY EXERTION AND HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, DEBILITATING MIGRAINES. BUT THOSE ARE CERTAINLY NOT MY ONLY SYMPTOMS. I HAVE BROUGHT MY ISSUES TO MY PCPS OVER THE LAST YEARS. THEY TESTED ME FOR A FEW POSSIBLE COMMON CAUSES, BUT COULDN'T FIND A REASON. EVENTUALLY, THEY JUST IGNORED THESE SYMPTOMS. I RECENTLY CHANGED PCPS AND MY NEW ONE BEGAN A DILIGENT PROCESS OF ELIMINATION. SHE HAS BEEN SENDING ME TO SPECIALISTS AND WE'VE BEEN DOING ONE TEST AFTER ANOTHER TO RULE THINGS OUT. THEY'VE ALL COME OUT NORMAL. UNTIL WE DID A BREAST ULTRASOUND. IT SHOWED SIGNS OF IMPLANT RUPTURE. I WAS SENT TO DO AN MRI, AND IT CONFIRMED IMPLANT RUPTURE. DUE TO MY MASTECTOMIES, I HAVE NO SENSATION IN MY BREAST OR ARMPIT AREAS, SO WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG AGO THE RUPTURE TOOK PLACE. BECAUSE SILENT RUPTURES ARE COMMON, THE RUPTURE COULD HAVE HAPPENED YEARS AGO. THE CHANGE IN SHAPE AND SIZE AND THEIR ASYMMETRY HAS BEEN NOTICEABLE FOR SOME YEARS, BUT MY PREVIOUS PCP HAD NO COMMENT ABOUT THAT. I AM EXTREMELY UPSET THAT I WAS NOT SENT FOR A BREAST ULTRASOUND OR OTHER RELATED TEST BY MY PREVIOUS PCP. ALL THE LITERATURE SAYS THAT PEOPLE WITH BREAST IMPLANTS SHOULD BE FOLLOWED ON A REGULAR BASIS. I AM EXTREMELY THANKFUL THAT I HAVE FOUND A DILIGENT PCP AND AN NOW IN GOOD CARE. I KNOW THAT A CONNECTION BETWEEN IMPLANTS AND RUPTURED IMPLANTS AND HEALTH ISSUES ISN'T SOMETHING THE MAJORITY OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION WANTS TO ADMIT, BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE CONNECTION IS REAL. SINCE DISCOVERING THAT MY IMPLANTS ARE RUPTURED, I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONNECT WITH OVER (B)(6) WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS OR RUPTURED IMPLANTS WHO ARE HAVING THE SAME SYMPTOMS I HAVE, AND MORE. MANY OF THEM ARE IN WORSE CONDITION THAN I AM. ALL OF US HAVE LOST QUALITY OF LIFE. A HUGE PERCENTAGE OF THEM REPORT THAT THEIR HEALTH ISSUES SUBSIDE AFTER HAVING THEIR IMPLANTS REMOVED. AND THESE ARE ONLY THE WOMEN WITH WHOM I HAVE CONNECTED. THERE MUST BE SO MANY MORE OUT THERE. THE WORST PART OF ALL THIS IS THAT OUR CONDITIONS ARE BEING IGNORED OR POO-POOED BY THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY SO THERE IS OFTEN NO HELP FOR US UNLESS AND UNTIL WE CAN FIND A DOCTOR WHO TAKES OUT HEALTH SERIOUSLY. I AM CURRENTLY WAITING FOR A DATE TO HAVE MY IMPLANTS REMOVED. I WILL NOT HAVE THEM REPLACED. I AM PRAYING THAT, ONCE THEY ARE REMOVED, I WILL BE ABLE TO REGAIN MY HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE.|SILTEX LB GEL-FILLED MAMMARY PROSTHESIS|354*2007|01/12/2016||||*|*||I|FWM|1.0||SILTEX LB GEL-FILLED MAMMARY PROSTHESIS||L13410|||||MENTOR MEDICAL SYSTEMS B.

THE DARN IMPLANTS HAVE BEEN LEAKING AS PER THE BIOPSY THAT I JUST WAS NOTIFIED ABOUT I HAVE SILICONE IN MY TISSUE EVEN THOUGH MY IMPLANTS DID NOT HAVE A NORMAL BREAK IN THEM. SO MAYBE THE FDA SHOULD HAVE MADE ME AWARE OF HOW UNSAFE SILICONE IMPLANTS BY THIS COMPANY INNAMED OR MCGHAN STYLE 153 DOUBLE LUMEN. THE MRI I DID HAVE COULD NOT TELL FOR SURE ANYTHING I THOUGHT IT COULD HAVE A RUPTURE IN ONE BREAST. THIS ONE HAD BEEN REPLACED PREVIOUSLY BY MY FORMER SURGEON AND THE BREAST HAD CAPSULAR CONTRACTION, WAS HARD A ROCK. THIS ONE WAS REPLACED BY FORMER SURGEON AFTER THE ORIGINAL SURGERY IN 2002 - 2003. SO I WAS SHOCKED TO LEARN THESE IMPLANTS WERE NOT WHAT I HAD THOUGHT I WAS GETTING, AND WHEN I CALLED TO FIND OUT ANY INFO I WAS GIVEN, THE RUN AROUND SAYING I WAS NOT ON THE LIST BY MFR OF BOTH OF THE CURRENT COMPANIES OF THIS TYPE OF IMPLANT WHICH IS EVEN MORE UNSAFE FOR THE PUBLIC, AND GOD KNOWS I HAVE SUFFERED MYSELF NOW FOR YEARS WITH UNEXPLAINED PAIN IN MY ARMS, TIREDNESS AND THE STRESS OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HECK WAS WRONG WITH ME. SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE. THIS IS JUST NOT FAIR. WE ARE AT OUR LOWEST WHEN WE LEARN OF THE CANCER AND ARE TRYING TO PREVENT ANYTHING MORE SERIOUS FROM HAPPENING. SINCE I HAD 4 CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 18 AT THE TIME OF MY SURGERY YEARS AGO TO LEARN. YEARS LATER THE PERSON I TRUSTED LIED AND MY GOVERNMENT IS NOT WATCHING OUT FOR OUR SAFETY THIS MAKES ME VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE USA WHEN EUROPE HAS BETTER SAFETY MEASURES IN PLACE FOR THE CITIZENS OF THEIR COUNTRY. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST DEVICE AND I'M SURE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE LAST SINCE MY DAUGHTER IS SUFFERING FROM A DIFFERENT DEVICE, AND NO ONE CARES ABOUT THAT EITHER.

5801905|49945687|D|1||OVER THE LAST 15 YEARS MY HEALTH HAS DECLINED. THE FIRST 10 OF THOSE YEARS I DEVELOPED FATIGUE, HORMONAL IMBALANCES, REOCCURRING YEAST INFECTIONS, ACNE AND RANDOM PAIN THROUGHOUT MY BODY ALONG WITH VARIOUS OTHER UNEXPLAINED AILMENTS. THESE SYMPTOMS CONTINUALLY GOT WORSE AND MORE SYMPTOMS STARTED OCCURRING. THE PAST 4 YEARS I BEGIN HAVING SO MUCH PAIN IN MY FEET AND LEGS THAT I COULD BARELY WALK. I WAS TESTED FOR PLANTARS FASCIITIS WHICH CAME BACK NEGATIVE, PHYSICAL THERAPY AND CHIROPRACTIC APPOINTMENTS BECAUSE WAS TOLD POSSIBLE NERVE PINCH IN LOWER BACK. THREE YEARS AGO THE PAIN CREPT UP INTO MY HANDS AND ARMS AND CONTINUING THROUGHOUT MY WHOLE BODY FEELING AS THOUGH SOMEONE HAD DUMPED CHEMICAL ACID ON MY BODY TO THE POINT ALL I COULD DO IS LAY IN BED AT NIGHT AND WISH I WOULD DIE. IN APPROX (B)(6) 2014, MY WHOLE BODY DECIDED TO REACT BY NOT BEING UNABLE TO REGULATE ITS BODY TEMPERATURE, EXTREME DIZZINESS TO THE POINT OF BLACKOUTS, EXTREME FATIGUE TO WHERE I BARELY COULD FUNCTION FOR A FEW HOURS THEN WOULD HAVE TO SLEEP, I FELT AS THOUGH I WAS SUFFOCATING ALL THE TIME, MY HANDS BEGAN SHAKING TO THE POINT I COULD NOT HOLD MY PHONE OR A GLASS. I COULD NOT THINK CLEARLY AND WAS HAVING EXTREME MEMORY LOSS, I WENT FROM HAVING 20/20 VISION TO NEEDING TRIFOCALS IN A MATTER OF LESS THAN A YEAR. THE PAIN IN MY BODY GOT WORSE AND NEVER LET UP. I HAVE TO KEEP MY HOME AT ABOUT 68 DEGREES BECAUSE HEAT MAKES THE CHEMICAL ACID BURNING INCREASE 10 FOLD, I HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME LEAVING MY HOME BECAUSE I LIVE IN THE DESERT AND THE SUN LITERALLY MAKES MY SKIN FEEL AS THOUGH IT IS BLISTERING. BETWEEN (B)(6) 2014 AND (B)(6) 2015 I LOST (B)(6) POUNDS UNEXPLAINABLY. ON (B)(6) 2015 MY PRIMARY PHYSICIAN WROTE ME OUT OF WORK FOR A WEEK THEN 2 WEEKS THEN FOR AN UNDETERMINED AMOUNT OF TIME AND SAID I NEEDED TO SEE A NEUROLOGIST. I FOLLOWED UP WITH A NEUROLOGIST WHO SAID HE BELIEVED I HAD PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY, BUT PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY DID NOT FIT ALL THE SYMPTOMS I WAS HAVING. AT THIS POINT I STARTED GOING TO THE (B)(6) CLINIC IN LATE (B)(6) 2015 WHO BY JUST MY SYMPTOMS FIGURED I HAD EITHER LUPUS, MS, HODGKIN'S DISEASE, LYME DISEASE OR SOME OTHER AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE. THEY PERFORMED MULTIPLE MRI'S, CAT SCANS, PET SCANS, BLOOD AND URINE TESTS, NERVE TESTS, HEART TESTS, LUNG TESTS AND MANY OTHER TESTS TO TRY AND DETERMINE WHY I WAS SICK. THEY DID DETERMINE THAT MY BLOOD PRESSURE WAS EXTREMELY LOW AND WOULD BOTTOM OUT IF I STOOD OR MOVE TOO QUICKLY CAUSING THE DIZZINESS AND BLACKOUTS. WHICH IS OPPOSITE OF WHAT I WAS 4 YEARS AGO TAKING MEDICINE FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. THEY DETERMINED I HAD EARLY STAGES OF EMPHYSEMA AND COPD. THE PET SCAN SHOWED NO TYPE OF CANCER, AND MY BLOOD WORK CAME BACK FINE OTHER THAN MY C-REACTIVE PROTEIN WAS AT 18. AT THIS POINT THEY DETERMINED I HAD AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE FOR UNK REASONS WITH SMALL FIBER NEUROPATHY. NONE OF THE MEDICATIONS OR THE INTERVENOUS STEROIDS RELIEVED MY SYMPTOMS. IN (B)(6) 2015, MY DAUGHTER DISCOVERED WHAT IS KNOWN AS BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESS. ALL THE SYMPTOMS LISTED FOR THIS WAS WHAT I WAS DEALING WITH. I HAD MY IMPLANTS REMOVED (B)(6) ENBLOCK STYLE WITH CAPSULES COMPLETELY REMOVED. SINCE THIS TIME I HAVE STEADILY FELT MY HEALTH RETURNING. SINCE SURGERY MY MEMORY HAS GOTTEN BETTER ALONG WITH WHAT I CALL THE BRAIN FOG, THE PAIN ALL OVER MY BODY HAS LESSENED TO MAYBE AN 8 INSTEAD OF A 10, THE SHAKING ONLY OCCURS ONCE IN AWHILE.

MY PLASTIC SURGEON DID A WONDERFUL JOB USING FAT TRANSFER FROM MY ABDOMEN IN ORDER TO FILL IN THE HOLES IN MY CHEST. YOU SEE, I'M VERY THIN. WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN VERY ILL FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS. I DID NOT HAVE MUCH FAT AT ALL TO HELP WITH THIS PROCEDURE. TODAY, I SAW MY PLASTIC SURGEON AND HE HAD TO DRAIN FLUID FROM THIS RIGHT BREAST AGAIN. SO WE ARE STILL DEALING WITH THIS SITUATION. BUT I AM OPTIMISTIC THAT REMOVING THE IMPLANTS WERE MY LAST HOPE AND GETTING MY BODY HEALTHY AGAIN. I TRULY BELIEVE THAT MY IMPLANTS CAUSED MY ILLNESS AND THAT OTHER WOMEN HEAR MY STORY.|SILICONE IMPLANTS||09/02/2016||||N|*||I|FTR|1.0||SILICONE IMPLANTS||5954855|||||MENTOR|||||||True
