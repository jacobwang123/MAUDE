6559362|74887820|N|1||(B)(4). THE REPORTED EVENTS ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THESE EVENTS. DEVICE HISTORY RECORD REVIEW: REVIEW OF DHR FOR WORK ORDER 2183997 DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY DEVIATIONS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS OR NON-CONFORMANCES DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. ALL GEL BREAST IMPLANTS WERE REVIEWED AS PART OF THE ASSEMBLY OPERATIONS AND THESE TASKS WERE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO APPLICABLE CURRENT PROCEDURES TO ENSURE THAT ASSEMBLY MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. THE DHR ASSEMBLY REPORT FROM SAP WAS VERIFIED AND THERE WAS NO SCRAP RELATED WITH REPORTED EVENT, ALL DEVICES WERE CONFORMANCE DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION GATHERED DURING THE DHR REVIEW, THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT DEVICES FROM WORK ORDER 2183997 WERE ASSEMBLED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALLERGAN MEDICAL PROCEDURES AND SPECIFICATIONS. THE REPORTED DEVICE WAS INTACT AT THE TIME OF PRODUCTION AND MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. REPORTED EVENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN THE LABELING: PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENT. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. YOU SHOULD PERFORM SELF-EXAMINATION OF YOUR BREASTS EVERY MONTH FOR CANCER SCREENING. HOWEVER, THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU DISTINGUISH THE IMPLANT FROM YOUR BREAST TISSUE. THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGES IN IMPLANT SHAPE, MAY BE SIGNS OF A RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. THESE SIGNS SHOULD BE REPORTED TO YOUR SURGEON AND POSSIBLY EVALUATED WITH AN MRI. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM.

6498449|72963713|N|1||THIS REPORT IS SUBMITTED IN RESPONSE TO FDA NOTICE TITLED BREAST IMPLANT-ASSOCIATED ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (BIA-ALCL) PROVIDED ON 21/MAR/2017. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CASES REFERENCED IN THE NOTICE IS 359, INCLUDING 9 DEATHS. THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE NOTICE CLASSIFIES THE ALCL EVENTS IN DIFFERENT CATEGORIES, INCLUDING TYPES OF DEVICE, ASSOCIATED ADVERSE EVENTS, PRESENTATION, AND DIAGNOSIS DETAILS, BUT DOES NOT IDENTIFY SPECIFIC DEVICES OR PATIENTS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO INDIVIDUALIZE THIS INFORMATION INTO SPECIFIC REPORTS, AND BY DEFINITION ALREADY INCLUDES EVENTS REPORTED BY ALLERGAN IN THE PAST. THEREFORE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH 21 CFR 803, THIS REPORT WILL REPRESENT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF RECEIPT OF THE NOTICE AND DOCUMENTATION OF ALLERGAN'S ATTEMPT TO INVESTIGATE ADVERSE EVENTS IDENTIFIED IN THAT NOTICE. THIS REPORT WILL NOT SUBSTITUTE FOR ANY INVESTIGATION INTO COMPLAINTS RECEIVED WHERE INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS OR ALLERGAN DEVICES ARE IDENTIFIED, INCLUSIVE OR EXCLUSIVE OF THE 359 CASES MENTIONED IN THE NOTICE. (B)(4). THE EVENTS OF DEATH, LYMPHOMA-ALCL, LYMPHOMA, SEROMA, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, AND BREAST LUMPS ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THESE EVENTS. SALINE DEVICE LABELING: RADIATION TO THE BREAST Â¿ ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE IN VIVO EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, ASYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER THESE ADDITIONAL SURGERIES. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF DEFLATION. ADDITIONAL COMPLICATIONS Â¿ AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. CALCIUM DEPOSITS CAN FORM IN THE TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT WITH SYMPTOMS THAT MAY INCLUDE PAIN AND FIRMNESS. LYMPHADENOPATHY HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED IN SOME WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS. IN THE PASS STUDY, AT LEAST 1 REOPERATION WAS PERFORMED ON 315 PATIENTS (36.5%) THROUGH 10 YEARS. A TOTAL OF 424 REOPERATIONS WERE PERFORMED. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR REOPERATION THROUGH 10 YEARS ON AUGMENTATION PATIENTS WAS IMPLANT DEFLATION AT 21.7%. THE PERCENTAGE OF REOPERATIONS DUE TO LUMP/MASS/CYST INCREASED FROM 8.5% OF 293 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 5 YEARS TO 13.9% OF 424 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 10 YEARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF LUMPS, MASSES, AND CYSTS CAN BE EXPECTED TO NATURALLY INCREASE AS PATIENTS AGE AND COULD BE AN EXPLANATION FOR THE INCREASE. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.

DEATHS MUST BE REPORTED TO ALLERGAN AND FDA. SILICONE DEVICE LABELING: ONE OF THE KEY COMPLICATIONS REPORTED IS CALLED Â¿CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE.Â¿ CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS A TIGHTENING OF THE SCAR TISSUE (ALSO CALLED A CAPSULE) THAT NORMALLY FORMS AROUND THE BREAST IMPLANT DURING THE HEALING PROCESS AFTER SURGERY. IN SOME WOMEN, THE SCAR TISSUE (CAPSULE) SQUEEZES THE IMPLANT. THIS RESULTS IN FIRMNESS OR HARDENING OF THE BREAST, AND IT IS A RISK FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE. DEGREES OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE ARE CLASSIFIED BY THE BAKER GRADING SCALE.1 CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BAKER GRADES III AND IV ARE THE MOST SEVERE. BAKER GRADE III OFTEN RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SURGERY (REOPERATION) BECAUSE OF PAIN AND POSSIBLY ABNORMAL APPEARANCE. BAKER GRADE IV USUALLY RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR REOPERATION BECAUSE OF PAIN AND UNACCEPTABLE APPEARANCE. DO NOT TREAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BY CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY OR FORCEFUL EXTERNAL COMPRESSION, WHICH WILL LIKELY RESULT IN IMPLANT DAMAGE, RUPTURE, FOLDS, AND/OR HEMATOMA. ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY.

BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. REPORTS IN THE MEDICAL LITERATURE INDICATE THAT PATIENTS WITH BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT AT A GREATER RISK THAN THOSE WITHOUT BREAST IMPLANTS FOR DEVELOPING BREAST CANCER. REPORTS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT BREAST IMPLANTS MAY INTERFERE WITH OR DELAY BREAST CANCER DETECTION BY MAMMOGRAPHY AND/OR BIOPSY; HOWEVER, OTHER REPORTS IN THE PUBLISHED MEDICAL LITERATURE INDICATE THAT BREAST IMPLANTS NEITHER SIGNIFICANTLY DELAY BREAST CANCER DETECTION NOR ADVERSELY AFFECT CANCER SURVIVAL OF WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS. A LARGE FOLLOW-UP STUDY REPORTED NO EVIDENCE OF AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND CANCER, AND EVEN SHOWED A DECREASED INCIDENCE OF BREAST CANCER COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION. ONE STUDY HAS REPORTED AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF BRAIN CANCER IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS AS COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION. THE INCIDENCE OF BRAIN CANCER, HOWEVER, WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS WHEN COMPARED TO WOMEN WHO HAD OTHER PLASTIC SURGERIES A PUBLISHED REVIEW OF 4 LARGE STUDIES IN WOMEN WITH COSMETIC IMPLANTS AND AN ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP STUDY CONCLUDED THAT THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT SUPPORT AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BRAIN CANCER AND BREAST IMPLANTS. AN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL REVIEW ALSO LENT SUPPORT TO THE LACK OF CAUSATION BETWEEN IMPLANTS AND ANY TYPE OF CANCER. STUDIES HAVE REPORTED AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF RESPIRATORY/LUNG CANCER IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS. OTHER STUDIES OF WOMEN IN SWEDEN AND DENMARK HAVE FOUND THAT WOMEN WHO GET BREAST IMPLANTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE CURRENT SMOKERS THAN WOMEN WHO GET BREAST REDUCTION SURGERY OR OTHER TYPES OF COSMETIC SURGERY. SEVERAL LARGE STUDIES HAVE FOUND NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND RESPIRATORY/LUNG CANCER. TWO STUDIES REPORTED AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF CERVICAL/VULVAR CANCER IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS. ANOTHER LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP STUDY SHOWED EQUIVALENT INCIDENCES OF CERVICAL CANCER IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION. OTHER RECENT LARGE STUDIES CONCLUDED THAT THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT SUPPORT AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM CANCERS AND BREAST IMPLANTS. THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL STUDIES PUBLISHED THAT EXAMINED THE RISK OF OTHER TYPES OF CANCERS, E.G., THYROID CANCERS, URINARY SYSTEM CANCERS, SARCOMA, ENDOCRINE CANCER, CONNECTIVE TISSUE CANCER, CANCER OF THE EYE, AND UNSPECIFIED CANCERS IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS.

THE REPORTED EVENTS ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THESE EVENTS. REVIEW OF DHR (DEVICE HISTORY RECORD) FOR WORK ORDER (B)(4) DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY DEVIATIONS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS OR NON-CONFORMANCES DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. ALL GEL BREAST IMPLANTS WERE REVIEWED AS PART OF THE ASSEMBLY OPERATIONS AND THESE TASKS WERE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO APPLICABLE CURRENT PROCEDURES TO ENSURE THAT ASSEMBLY MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. DHR FOR WORK ORDER (B)(4) INDICATES THAT THERE WAS A REPROCESS FOR TWO UNITS ON THE PRIMARY PACKAGING OPERATION, HOWEVER THIS WAS COMPLETED ON A DIFFERENT SERIAL NUMBER UNIT AND THIS HAS NO RELATION NEITHER CAN CAUSE THE REPORTED EVENT. THE DHR ASSEMBLY REPORT FROM ORACLE WAS VERIFIED AND THERE WAS NOT ANY SCRAP RELATED WITH REPORTED EVENT, ALL DEVICES WERE CONFORMANCE DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION GATHERED DURING THE DHR REVIEW, THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT DEVICES FROM WORK ORDER (B)(4) WERE ASSEMBLED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALLERGAN MEDICAL PROCEDURES AND SPECIFICATIONS. THE REPORTED DEVICE WAS INTACT AT THE TIME OF PRODUCTION AND MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. REPORTED EVENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN THE LABELING: ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. YOU SHOULD PERFORM SELF-EXAMINATION OF YOUR BREASTS EVERY MONTH FOR CANCER SCREENING. HOWEVER, THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU DISTINGUISH THE IMPLANT FROM YOUR BREAST TISSUE. THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGES IN IMPLANT SHAPE, MAY BE SIGNS OF A RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. THESE SIGNS SHOULD BE REPORTED TO YOUR SURGEON AND POSSIBLY EVALUATED WITH AN MRI. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY.

6386903|69480688|D|1||ONE OF THE FIRST SIGNS THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WAS IN EARLY (B)(6) 2009. I WAS HOSPITALIZED FOR RAPID HEART RATE AND LOW BLOOD PRESSURE. I WAS LATER DIAGNOSED WITH POSTURAL ORTHOSTATIC TACHYCARDIA SYNDROME AND PLACED ON METOPROLOL. I WAS ABLE TO RETURN TO A MOSTLY NORMAL LIFE, ALTHOUGH THE SYMPTOMS NEVER WENT AWAY. FROM THAT TIME ON, I DEVELOPED MORE AND MORE SYMPTOMS THAT PILED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER. THEY RANGED FROM FAIRLY BENIGN TO INCREASINGLY MORE SERIOUS AND PROBLEMATIC. I SUFFERED BOUTS OF VERTIGO; A RASH THAT LEFT PAINFUL SORES, RINGING IN MY EARS, BALANCE ISSUES, BLADDER AND KIDNEY ISSUES, A DIAGNOSIS OF INTERSTITIAL CYSTITIS, MEMORY AND COGNITIVE PROBLEMS, FOOD SENSITIVITIES AND DEBILITATING DIGESTIVE ISSUES, CONSTANT NAUSEA, NEUROLOGICAL ISSUES, TUNNEL VISION, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, HEART PALPITATIONS, DEBILITATING WEAKNESS AND FATIGUE. I GREW INCREASINGLY WEAKER AND MORE ILL. I WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO WORK AND WAS PLACED ON DISABILITY. I BEGAN USING A CANE, THEN A WALKER, AND EVENTUALLY HAD TO BE PUSHED IN A WHEELCHAIR. NO ONE HAD ANY ANSWERS FOR ME. ONE WEEKEND IN EARLY 2014, I TOOK A SEVERE TURN FOR THE WORSE. I COULD NO LONGER GET OUT OF BED AND HAD TO HAVE ASSISTANCE BATHING AND DRESSING. I HAPPENED TO NOTICE THAT ONE OF MY BREAST IMPLANTS (FROM BREAST CANCER IN 2000) HAD GONE FLAT. WE BEGAN TO WONDER IF MY ILLNESS COULD HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH MY IMPLANTS. MY HUSBAND BEGAN TO RESEARCH THAT POSSIBLE RELATIONSHIP. IN (B)(6) 2014, BOTH RUPTURED IMPLANTS, DAMAGED LYMPH NODES, AFFECTED CHEST MUSCLE, AND SURROUNDING TISSUE (TO MY CHEST WALL) WERE REMOVED DURING A 7 HOUR SURGERY. OVER THE PAST 3 YEARS I HAVE SLOWLY BEGUN TO IMPROVE. I CAN WALK SHORT DISTANCES WITH THE USE OF A CANE; I STILL HAVE TO USE AN ELECTRIC SCOOTER OR BE PUSHED IN A WHEELCHAIR IF I HAVE TO STAND FOR LONG OR GO VERY FAR. I STILL HAVE MOST SYMPTOMS, BUT MANY HAVE IMPROVED AT LEAST SLIGHTLY. I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO RETURN TO THE JOB THAT I LOVED. I USED TO BE AN ACTIVE, SOCIAL, HAPPY, HARD-WORKING PERSON. NOW I RARELY LEAVE MY HOUSE - NEVER WITHOUT ASSISTANCE. BESIDES DEVELOPING MULTIPLE FOOD SENSITIVITIES, I HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED AN EXTREME SENSITIVITY TO MOLD AND CHEMICAL EXPOSURE. I FEEL LIKE A VIRTUAL SHELL OF THE PERSON THAT I ONCE WAS. I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING TO HAVE MY LIFE BACK.

THE BREAST IMPLANT INDUSTRY KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE PUTTING INTO WOMEN'S BODIES AND WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THEM, IT JUST NEEDS TO BE PROVEN IN A COURT OF LAW AND IT'S TIME. CANCER IS NOW LINKED TO BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE THAT TYPE OF CANCER BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE IS TO TAKE OUT THE IMPLANTS AND TEST THE FLUID AROUND THE IMPLANTS.

SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY.

SHE BECAME EXTREMELY ILL IN (B)(6) 2012, SHE DID NOT GO TO THE HOSPITAL UNTIL (B)(6) 2013 BECAUSE SHE DID NOT HAVE ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. SHE WAS ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL ON (B)(6) 2013 WITH UNCONTROLLED DIARRHEA. SHE WAS ADMITTED AGAIN ON (B)(6) 2013 WITH DEHYDRATION AND ON (B)(6) 2013 DEHYDRATION. ON (B)(6) 2013 SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH METASTATIC BREAST CANCER TO BRAIN, LIVER, ESSENTIALLY THROUGHOUT HER ENTIRE BODY. SHE WAS TRANSFERRED TO INPATIENT REHAB ON (B)(6) 2013. FOLLOW UP VISIT WITH THE NEUROLOGIST SHOWED THAT ALTHOUGH SHE HAD MANY BRAIN LESIONS, THE SPINAL TAP WAS NEGATIVE FOR CANCER CELLS. A FULL BODY AND BRAIN PET SCAN WAS COMPLETED ON (B)(6) 2013. THIS SHOWED THAT SHE HAD LESIONS (TOO MANY TO COUNT) THROUGHOUT HER ENTIRE BODY. THE NEUROLOGIST WAS NOT CONVINCED THAT IT WAS METASTATIC BREAST CANCER IN THE BRAIN BECAUSE IT WAS ATYPICAL OF WHAT HE SAW WITH BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. HE THOUGHT POSSIBLE SARCOID OR LYMPHOMA. THE NEUROLOGIST STARTED HER ON LARGE DOSES OF STEROIDS AND OVER SEVERAL MONTHS AND REPEATED THE FULL BODY AND BRAIN PET SCAN ON (B)(6) 2013 WHICH THE RADIOLOGIST COMPARED TO THE PET SCAN OF (B)(6) 2013. THE RADIOLOGIST REPORTED THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE LESIONS FOUND ON THE (B)(6) 2013 EXAM HAD ESSENTIALLY ""MELTED"" AWAY AND THE HYPER METABOLIC BOWEL WAS COMPLETELY RESOLVED. HE ALSO WROTE ""BOTH OF THE ABOVE FINDINGS UNDOUBTEDLY REPRESENT SARCOID. AS THE NEUROLOGIST BEGAN TAPERING OFF THE STEROIDS, HE REPEATED SEVERAL MRI'S OF HER BRAIN, IN (B)(6) 2013, SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY AND BEGAN INCREASING THE STEROIDS TO SOME DEGREE. IN (B)(6) 2015, SHE BEGAN HAVING VISION PROBLEMS AND HEADACHES. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE LESIONS HAD RETURNED AND THIS TIME, THEY WERE ON HER RETINAS AS WELL THROUGHOUT HER ENTIRE BODY. WE TOOK HER TO (B)(6) CLINIC FOR EVALUATION OF HER RETINAS. WE DISCUSSED OUR THEORY THAT THIS WAS POSSIBLY RELATED TO THE BREAST IMPLANT AND NOT BREAST METASTASES. THE PHYSICIANS AT (B)(6) REVIEWED ALL OF THE MEDICAL RECORDS THAT WE BROUGHT WITH US AND FELT THAT SARCOID WAS A POSSIBILITY BUT WOULD NEED TO BIOPSY HER RETINA TO DETERMINE FOR SURE. THE BIOPSY WAS DONE AT (B)(6) CLINIC AND WAS REPORTED TO BE BREAST METASTASES. AT THIS POINT, SHE CONTINUED WITH FOLLOW UP VISITS TO MULTIPLE DOCTORS. ON (B)(6) 2015 MET WITH ONCOLOGISTS AT (B)(6) AT FAMILY REQUEST - PATIENT AND FAMILY REQUESTED THAT THE IMPLANT BE REMOVED BUT THEY DID NOT WANT TO DO IT. SHE MET WITH (B)(6) ONCOLOGIST ON (B)(6) 2015 WHERE SHE AGAIN REQUESTED THAT THE IMPLANT BE REMOVED. THE ONCOLOGIST SCHEDULED A LIVER BIOPSY AND THAT WAS DONE ON (B)(6) 2015. REPEATED VISITS TO DIFFERENT ONCOLOGISTS REPORTED THAT SHE HAD BREAST METASTASES AND WOULD NEED CHEMOTHERAPY. SHE REFUSED TO UNDERGO CHEMOTHERAPY. SHE HAD A LIVER BIOPSY ON (B)(6) 2015 AT (B)(6) CANCER INSTITUTE AND AGAIN SHE RECEIVED THE DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST METASTASES. SHE PASSED AWAY ON (B)(6) 2015 AT THE AGE OF (B)(6) YEARS.

RPTR IS IN CONSTANT FEAR OF CANCER NOT BEING DETECTED DUE TO THESE IMPLANTS. RPTR HONESTLY BELIEVES THAT THE IMPLANTS ARE THE CAUSE OF HER UNEXPLAINED FATIGUE AND ""JUST FEELING TERRIBLE."" SHE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IMPLANTS OUT, BUT ALSO IS AFRAID OF BEING PUT TO SLEEP. SINCE THE IMPLANT ILLNESSES HAVE RECENTLY BEEN REVEALED, HER DRS COULD NOT RELATE TO THIS CAUSE. RPTR HAS HAD YEARLY VISITS TO HER GYN, MOSTLY FOR MAMMOGRAMS, WHICH SHE FINDS OUT NOW WERE USELESS. RPTR IS NOT A COMPLAINER AND CONVEYED MOSTLY FATIGUE WHICH WAS CONTRIBUTED TO STRESS SINCE IMPLANT CAUSE WAS NOT KNOWN.

IN 1975 I HAD DOW CORNING BREAST IMPLANTS PLACED IN MY BODY FOR COSMETIC REASONS. I WAS A HEALTHY 33 YEAR OLD WOMAN. AFTER BEING TOLD IMPLANTS WERE PERFECTLY SAFE AND THAT THEY WOULD LAST A LIFE TIME I WILLINGLY SIGNED UP FOR SURGERY. WITHIN THREE MONTHS I DEVELOPED HARD CAPSULES BILATERALLY. MY SURGEON ASSURED ME ALL WAS WELL, HOWEVER HE WOULD NEED TO PERFORM A CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY IN ORDER TO SOFTEN BOTH BREASTS. I RECALL BEING FEARFUL OF THIS PROCEDURE AS A) MY SURGEON MADE ME PROMISE ""NOT TO YELL"" AND B) THERE WOULD BE NO ANESTHESIA. PROCEDURE WAS INDEED VERY PAINFUL AS HE MANUALLY APPLIED PRESSURE TO EACH BREAST AND ""CRACKED"" THEM. I FELT A TEARING SENSATION AROUND EACH BREAST. THIS WAS FIRST OF NINE CLOSED CAPSULOTOMIES, AND I SUSPECT MY LEFT IMPLANT WAS RUPTURED FROM VERY FIRST ONE. ONE YEAR AFTER IMPLANTATION I BEGAN TO HAVE PAIN IN JOINTS OF MY RIGHT HAND AND A STRANGE RASH APPEARED ON MY CHEST AND ARMS. THREE YEARS LATER I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH THYROID CANCER. WHEN I COLLECTED ALL MY MEDICAL RECORDS OVER LAST FEW YEARS I FOUND MY BIOPSY WHICH REFERRED NOT ONLY TO MY MALIGNANT TUMOR, BUT ALSO TO ""YELLOW GELATINOUS MATERIAL"" SURROUNDING MY THYROID GLAND. EVEN THOUGH MY MEDICAL RECORDS CLEARLY STATED I HAD HAD A BREAST AUGMENTATION, NO ONE AT TIME OF SURGERY MENTIONED PRESENCE OF A FOREIGN BODY MATERIAL FOUND IN MY GLAND. MY TUMOR WAS REMOVED YET AN OBVIOUSLY RUPTURED IMPLANT WAS ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN MY BODY FOR SEVERAL MORE YEARS. IT IS KNOWN THAT MOST OF MEDICAL COMMUNITY REFUSES TO ADMIT ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS AND DISEASE; HOWEVER, GIVEN THE PRESENCE OF SILICA THOUGHOUT MY THYROID GLAND AND LYMPH NODES THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND AS TO WHAT CAUSED MY CANCER. SIX YEARS AFTER IMPLANTATION MY RASH CONTINUED TO SPREAD, MY JOINTS ACHED AND MY LEFT BREAST BECAME PAINFUL AND ""HOT"" FEELING. MY LEFT NIPPLE ALSO TURNED A DARKER COLOR THAN OTHER ONE. I FELT FATIGUED, AND DISORIENTATED MOST OF TIME. I CONTINUED TO SEEK MEDICAL CARE AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS NO EXPLANATION FOR MY BODY RASH. MY PHYSICIANS COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR MY SLOW RECOVERY FROM THYROID CANCER AND ALL RELATED TREATMENTS I ENDURED. DUE TO PAIN AND CONTINUED HARDENING OF MY LEFT BREAST MY SURGEON DECIDED TO REPLACE THIS IMPLANT WITH ANOTHER DOW CORNING UNIT. AFTER SURGERY HE DID NOT TELL ME THAT EXPLANTED IMPLANT WAS RUPTURED (I LEARNED ABOUT RUPTURE WHEN COLLECTING ALL MY DATA THREE YEARS AGO). TWELVE YEARS AFTER IMPLANTATION I BEGAN TO HAVE TREMORS IN MY LEFT HAND, CHRONIC GASTRITIS, JOINT ACHE AND A ""PINS AND NEEDLES"" SENSATION IN MY LEGS AND ARMS. AT TIMES I IMAGINED SPIDERS WERE CRAWLING ON MY LEGS. FROM THIS POINT MY HEALTH WENT INTO A DOWNWARD SPIRAL AND I BECAME MORE DEPRESSED AS EACH DOCTOR'S APPT SUGGESTED SAME METHOD OF TREATMENT... SEEK MENTAL THERAPY. BY 1994, AFTER 19 YEARS OF IMPLANTS, MY HEALTH HIT ROCK BOTTOM. I WAS FATIGUED BEYOND POINT OF RECOVERY, NERVOUS, DEPRESSED AND, YES, SUICIDAL. MY BODY WOULD REACT TO SLIGHTEST STIMULANT AND I WAS HAVING SEVERE MEMORY LOSS, AND I BECAME DYSLEXIC. AT ONE POINT I WENT TO OUR LOCAL MARKET, LESS THAN A MILE FROM HOME, AND I COULDN'T REMEMBER HOW TO DRIVE HOME. I BEGAN TO LOSE MY BALANCE AND I HAD DISTORTED VISION. EVEN TODAY ONE OF MY PUPILS DOES NOT DILATE NORMALLY. I RETURNED MANY TIMES TO TRY TO FIND A CURE FOR MY RACING HEARTBEAT, MY RASH, STIFFNESS AND PAIN IN MY LIMBS, TREMOR IN MY HAND, EYE AND VAGINAL DRYNESS. AGAIN I WAS TOLD TO SEEK COUNSELING. OVER THIS PERIOD MY MARRIAGE FAILED AND I BEGAN TO THINK I WAS REALLY CRAZY. I CONSIDERED TAKING MY LIFE MANY TIMES. BY 1994 I WAS FALLING INTO A DEEP HOLE. AFTER A NEAR HEAD ON COLLISION BECAUSE I WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY DISCERNING LEFT FROM RIGHT I BEGAN TO FEAR DRIVING. MY LIFE WAS OUT OF CONTROL. AS A RESULT OF ALL MEDIA COVERAGE AROUND 1994 ON BREAST IMPLANTS I RETURNED TO MY PLASTIC SURGEON. HE TOLD ME THERE COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN MY ""IMAGINED SYMPTOMS"" AND BREAST IMPLANTS. HE DID, HOWEVER, CONCEDE THAT MY IMPLANTS ""LOOKED TERRIBLE"" DUE TO EVER PRESENT CAPSULES. HE RELUCTANTLY AGREED TO REMOVE MY IMPLANTS ON MAY 4, 1994. OF COURSE IT WAS SUGGESTED I REPLACE THEM WITH SALINE IMPLANTS WHICH I DECLINED. ONE MONTH AFTER EXPLANTATION I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BRAIN LESIONS WHICH EXPLAINS MY DIAGNOSES OF ATYPICAL MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. FOR SIX MONTHS MY SYMPTOMS SEEM TO INTENSIFY AND THEN I BEGAN TO SLOWLY IMPROVE. TODAY I LIVE WITH DISCOMFORT AND PAIN OF STIFF LEGS AND SENSATION OF SPIDERS ON MY SKIN IS STILL WITH ME. CLIMATE EXTREMES MAKES PAIN IN MY LEGS UNBEARABLE. MY MEMORY HAS IMPROVED AND I NO LONGER SUFFER, OR CAUSE OTHERS TO SUFFER, THOSE HORRIBLE AND UNPREDICTABLE MOOD SWINGS. MY CANCER IS IN REMISSION AND I AM ON MEDICATION FOR REST OF MY LIFE. MY RASH, IT APPEARS, IS WITH ME FOR LIFE. EVEN THOUGH I'VE HAD SOME IMPROVEMENT MY HEALTH HAS BEEN PERMANENTLY DAMAGED BY BREAST IMPLANTS. WHAT HAS ALL THIS MEANT TO ME? I AM ANGRY TO HAVE LOST 19 YEARS OF MY LIFE TO AVARICE AND DECEPTION OF DOW CORNING. I MOURN LOSS OF MY FIRST MARRIAGE AND I CAN'T HELP WONDERING WHAT LONG TERM HEALTH RISKS ARE FOR ME AND MY FELLOW SURVIVORS. WOULD I HAVE CONSENTED TO BREAST IMPLANTS HAD I BEEN TOLD OF CONSEQUENCES OR GIVEN CONSIDERATION OF READING MANY NEGATIVE TEST RESULTS DOW CORNING HAD AVAILABLE AS EARLY AS 1975? ABSOLUTELY NOT! I WILL DO ALL THAT IS POSSIBLE TO DISCOURAGE YOUNGER WOMEN FROM PURSUING IMPLANTS BE THEY SALINE, SOY, OR WHATEVER ELSE SOME MISGUIDED SCIENTIST DREAMS UP. I STRUGGLE EACH DAY TO COME TO TERMS WITH WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME. THER'S A PART OF ME THAT WANTS TO DENY DECEPTION AND LIES OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES.

SHE HAD NO IDEA THAT A HOSP WOULD PERFORM A PROCEDURE THAT HAD NOT BEEN APPROVED. AFTER DISCUSSING THE PROCEDURE, AND THE POSSIBILITY OF FUTURE CANCER, SHE CHOOSE THE BREAST IMPLANTS. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE OPERATION SHE HAD PROBLEMS. SHE NO LONGER HAD A SEPARATION BETWEEN THE BREASTS. HER BREASTS WERE AND STILL ARE LUMPY. THEY WERE TWO DIFFERENCT SIZES AND STILL ARE. THE SCARS ARE STILL LARGE AND VERY DARK IN COLOR. SHE ALSO HAS ALOT OF PAIN IN HER RIGHT BREAST. COLLAGEN INJECTIONS WERE INJECTED INTO THE SCARS TO LIGHTEN THEM. THIS DID NOT HELP. A SECOND OPERATION WAS PERFORMED TO ADJUST THE LUMPY MASS AND TO SEPARATE THE BREASTS. THE LUMPS ARE STILL PRESENT. THE ORIGINAL IMPLANTS WERE REPLACED BACK INTO HER FOR A SECOND TIME. SHE LATER FOUND OUT THAT THIS PROCEDURE SAVES MONEY BY USING THE SAME IMPLANTS A SECOND TIME. THE BREASTS ARE SEPARATED NOW. SHE WAS TOLD THE SCARS WOULD FADE AND THE PAIN WOULD DECREASE AND TO BE PATIENT. AFTER MORE VISITS SHE WAS TOLD SHE LOOKED FINE. AGAIN, SHE WAS TOLD THE SCARS WOULD FADE AND THE PAIN WOULD DECREASE. SHE WAS TOLD SHE HAD EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS  AND TO SEEK HELP WITH HER EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS DEALING WITH HER BREAST IMPLANTS. SHE WAS TOLD SHE SHOULD BE GLAD THAT SHE WAS ALIVE. THIS STATEMENT ONLY AGITATED HER MORE. EARLY IN 1991 HER MD SENT HER TO ANOTHER DR WHO DID NOT THINK HER BREASTS LOOKED RIGHT EITHER. THE DR DISCUSSED DIFFERENT IMPLANTS, CORRECTING THE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE AND CORRECTING THE SCARS. SHE COULD NOT AFFORD THE COST OF THIS SURGERY. SHE FELT IT WAS A DETERRENT TO GET RID OF HER. SHE CURRENTLY HAS PAIN IN HER BREASTS. THERE IS ALSO A BLUE COLORED AREA IN ONE BREAST. MUSCLE AND JOINT PAIN FOR NO REASON. LUMPS AND CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE ARE ALSO A PROBLEM, CAUSING THE BREAST TO BE HARD AND ABNORMALLY SHAPED. SHE HAS ALSO HAD TO HAVE LUMPS IN HER FOOT GLAND SURGICALLY REMOVED. HER HANDS AND FEET SWELL FOR NO REASON. UNEXPLAINED FATIGUE PLAQUES HER. SHE WENT FROM A B CUP TO A DEFORMED A CUP. NONE OF THESE PROBLEMS WERE DISCUSSED PRIOR TO SURGERY AND SHE IS TOLD SHE IS FINE.

226781|18473741|D|1||"RPTR WRITES, ""AFTER HAVING MY DAUGHTER IN 6/70 I HAD PROBLEMS WITH BOTH MY BREASTS. AFTER HAVING MY SECOND DAUGHTER IN 7/71, PROBLEMS I HAD WITH BOTH MY BREASTS WERE GETTING WORSE. HAVING BEEN SEEN BY MY GENERAL PRACTITIONER, I WAS SENT FOR SCAN ON BOTH BREASTS. FIBROCYSTIC MASTITIS WAS DIAGNOSED, AND I ALSO HAD GREEN FLUID OOZING FROM BOTH NIPPLES ACCOMPANIED WITH SEVERE PAIN. THE TREATMENT I WAS ON WAS DANAZOL, BUT TO NO AVAIL. I SAW MY GENERAL PRACTITIONER AGAIN WHO THEN MADE ME AN APPOINTMENT TO SEE BREAST SURGEON. I HAD NO FURTHER SCANS THAT REVEALED I HAD FIBROCYSTIC MASTITIS; BY THAT TIME FLUID FROM BOTH MY NIPPLES HAD BECOME EMERALD GREEN COLOR, REALLY DARK GREEN, ALSO WITH PAIN BECOMING WORSE. I WAS TOLD TO WRAP HOT WATER BOTTLE IN TOWEL AND PLACE TO MY BREAST; AND I WAS GIVEN PAIN CONTROL DRUGS. I STOOD PAIN UNTIL I COULD NO MORE. IN 6/90, I SAW BREAST SURGEON AGAIN, ASKING HIM IF THERE WAS WAY HE COULD RELIEVE ME FROM TERRIBLE PAIN I WAS IN. I WAS TOLD THAT THERE COULD ONLY BE ONE SOLUTION, AND THAT WAS TO HAVE DOUBLE MASTECTOMY. HE WOULD ONLY DO IT IF I WAS TO HAVE SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. I AGREED. I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE. IN 8/89 I HAD BILATERAL ""MAMMADOCHECTOMY."" THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT EITHER, SO THAT'S WHY I ASKED FOR MASTECTOMY. I SAW BREAST SURGEON WHO REFERRED ME TO PLASTIC SURGEON, AND OPERATION WAS A JOINT ONE. THE BREAST WAS REMOVED, AND BREAST TISSUE DOWN TO MUSCLE (SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY); AND IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION WITH SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. THIS WAS CARRIED OUT IN 1990. I HAD BILATERAL SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY DEEP DOWN TO PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE, IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS IN 1990. THE IMPLANTS BECAME EXPOSED DUE TO SCARS GAPING OPEN, FLUID WAS OOZING OUT. SWABS TAKEN OF FLUID REVEALED AFTER CULTURED PLASMA (KLEBSIELLA AEROGENES). I WAS GIVEN IV 500 MG METRONIDAZOLE, TETRACYCLINE/FLUCLOXACILLIN/PAIN KILLERS TYLOX. I HAD BLOOD TRANSFUSION AND IMPLANTS REMOVED FOLLOWING DAY. I WAS TOLD WHAT HAPPENED WAS JUST A ONE IN A MILLION CHANCE OF EVER HAPPENING, AND THAT I COULD HAVE SECOND ATTEMPT OF BEING REINSERTED WITH THE BREAST IMPLANTS AFTER 8 MOS. I TOOK SURGEON'S OFFER, AND HAD SECOND ATTEMPT OF HAVING SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLANTS. AGAIN IN 1991 I HAD INSERTION OF BREAST IMPLANTS YET AGAIN. IN 1992 I ALSO HAD TO HAVE THEM REMOVED DUE TO SYSTEMIC INFECTION. IN 1997, I CAME ACROSS THE PACKAGE INSERT AND PRODUCT DATA SHEET, CLEARLY STATING THAT MASTITIS OR ANY ACTIVE INFECTION IS CONTRAINDICATED TO USE OF BREAST IMPLANTS MADE FROM SILICONE GEL. I AM SO ILL WITH FIBRO-FATTY CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDER, ACCOMPANIED WITH SEVERE PAIN, PROMINENTLY MARKED VASCULARITY, FIBROMYALGIA, CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME, HYPOTHYROIDISM, PLANTAR FASCIITIS, ARTHRITIS IN KNEES, HANDS AND BACK. I EXPERIENCE NOW SEVERE PAIN IN HANDS, FINGERS, ARMS, THIGHS, BUTTOCKS CHEEKS, HIPS, AND CALVES OF BOTH LEGS. I HAVE LOSS OF BALANCE, LOSS OF WORDS, CONCENTRATION PROBLEMS, DRY EYES, MOUTH, NOSE AND VAGINA. I ALSO HAVE A LOT OF INFECTIONS, BREATHING DIFFICULTY, BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS, THRUSH IN MOUTH/VAGINA, CHEST INFECTIONS, THROAT INFECTIONS, EAR INFECTIONS, BOWEL DISORDER, AND BLADDER PROBLEMS. I HAVE WIDESPREAD PAPILLOMAS, CHEST THROUGH ARMS AND NECK. I HAVE FIBROS TISSUE IN MY JOINTS. I ALSO HAVE PAIN IN MY HEAD; IT IS NOT A HEADACHE, IT IS LIKE WHEN INFECTION AND PUSS THROB LIKE PAIN. LOSS OF SLEEP, DROPPING THINGS, BUMPING INTO THINGS, ELECTRIC SHOCK - LIKE WHEN YOU TOUCH BARE WIRES ON ELECTRICAL GOODS, IF I TOUCH ANYTHING METAL. CRAWLING SENSATION IF I TOUCH NYLON, DRYLON, LEATHER OR POLYESTER; IF I USE TALC PERFUMED AND COLORED SOAP. I ALSO HAVE FOOD ALLERGIES. DUE TO HAVING BACTERIAL INFECTIONS I STILL EVEN TODAY TAKE METRONIDAZOLE, ANTIBIOTICS, AND ANTIFUNGAL MEDICATION TOO. I FEEL VERY WEAK, I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING CHRONIC FLU-LIKE SYMPTOMS, BUT I DON'T HAVE THE FLU. I CAN ONLY STAND, EVEN WALK SHORT PACES BEFORE BECOMING EXHAUSTED, AND MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE SEVERE PAIN I SUFFER FROM. I'M IN MY EARLY 40'S, BUT AT THIS MOMENT I FEEL LIKE 90, AND IT ISN'T RIGHT. DOCTORS I'M UNDER DON'T KNOW HOW TO BEGIN TO TREAT ME. HOWEVER, THEY KNOW WHAT CAUSE IS BUT AT THIS MOMENT CANNOT OFFER ANY KIND OF TREATMENT. I AM A TEST CASE OVER HERE OF THE DOCTORS WHO ARE DEALING WITH ME. LET'S HOPE SOMETHING CAN BE DONE PRETTY SOON. I DO BLAME SURGEONS FOR THEIR IGNORANCE AND STUPIDITY OF WAY THEY HAVE TREATED ME IN THE FIRST PLACE. TO BEGIN WITH, FOR IGNORING THE PRODUCT DATA SHEETS OF ALL BREAST IMPLANTS, ALONG WITH IGNORING THE PACKAGE INSERTS TOO. I HAVE LOST ALL TRUST AND FAITH IN MEDICAL PROFESSION. THE GOVERNMENT: FOR REFUSING TO CARRY OUT ANY KIND OF RESEARCH OR TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE LIKE ME WITH SAME ILLNESS; TREATMENT WE NEED SO DESPERATELY TO GET WELL. I KNOW I'M AS TOUGH AS NAILS. I DON'T INTEND TO SIT BACK AND DO NOTHING. I'M DETERMINED TO GET SOMEWHERE AND GET TREATMENT I SO DESPERATELY NEED. UP UNTIL 1989 I USED TO WORK FULL TIME, 16 HRS A DAY IN A CUTLERY FACTORY. I ALSO TOOK CARE OF MY MOM WHO DIED FROM TERMINAL CANCER BACK IN 1985. I ALSO TOOK CARE OF MY FATHER WHO ALSO DIED FROM A TERMINAL DISEASE. BOTH OF MY PARENTS DIED FROM CHEST ILLNESSES, MOST OF MY FATHER'S FAMILY DIED FROM TUBERCULOSIS, LUNG CANCER, HEART ATTACKS, AND STROKES. IN MY MOM'S FAMILY THEY DIED OF LUNG/BREAST CANCER ETHACENIA. THEY ALL WENT TO OPEN AIR SCHOOL. I WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS BORN IN PERFECT HEALTH, THAT IS UNTIL I MARRIED AND HAD CHILDREN AT THE AGE OF 16."" HISTORY: PT SUFFERED FROM CHRONIC BREAST PAIN FOR A PERIOD OF APPROX 20 YRS AND WHICH WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CYSTIC MASTITIS. VARIOUS CONSERVATIVE, DRUG TREATMENT REGIMES WERE TRIED TO HELP HER WITH THIS PROBLEM BUT TO NO AVAIL. SHE DESCRIBES HAVING A COLORED DISCHARGE COMING FROM HER NIPPLES IN ADDITION TO THE PAIN. SHE CAME UNDER THE CARE OF A CONSULTANT GENERAL SURGEON WHO PERFORMED AN OPERATION ON HER BREAST DUCTS IN 1989.

HE SAID THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE THE FORMATION OF THE SCAR TISSUE WITH THE CAPSULAR CONTRACTIONS. THIS IS HOW I WAS GIVEN A POLYURETHANE COATED IMPLANT IN MY LEFT BREAST (CANCER SIDE - MASTECTOMY). HISTORY: IN 1988 WENT TO SEE THIS PLASTIC SURGEON WHO WAS REFERRED TO ME TO SEE IF HE COULD POSSIBLY STITCH BOTH MY BREASTS UP FOR THEY HAD BECOME EMPTY SACS AFTER I STOPPED MENSTRUATING AND HIS SOLUTION WAS TO AUGMENT THEM AND AFTER CONSIDERATION HE DID AND PUT IN TWO SILICONE IMPLANTS. IN TIME THESE STARTED TO GIVE ME PAIN AND HAD CAPSULAR CONTRACTIONS AND THEY STARTED RIDING HIGH AND THEY WERE SO SEVERE THAT HE SUGGESTED THAT WITH HIS PTS WITH THIS PROBLEM HE OPTED FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE SILICONE AND REPLACE THEM WITH 2 POLYURETHANE IMPLANTS WHICH WOULD ADHERE BETTER AND YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SUCH CONTRACTIONS.

I REQUESTED ANOTHER MAMMOGRAM AT A DIFFERENT LOCATION AND THIS SHOWED NOTHING. ASKED MY DR IF I COULD HAVE A WRITTEN PRESCRIPTION TO HAVE A SONOGRAM PERFORMED AND I DID AND SURE ENOUGH I DID HAVE A LUMP. WENT TO SEE MY PLASTIC SURGEON AND HE REFERRED ME TO THE ONE OF THE FINEST BREAST SURGEONS. WENT TO SEE HIM FIRST OF JANUARY AND HE SCHEDULED ME FOR A BIOPSY ON 1/13/92 AND WHEN WE GOT THE REPORT BACK IT WAS CANCEROUS AND SO I WENT TO SEE HIM THE NEXT DAY AND WE DISCUSSED THE DIFFERENT PROCEDURES, ETC. AND HE BOOKED ME FOR SURGERY ON 1/21/1992. I OPTED FOR A MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY BECAUSE I DID HAVE THE SILICONE IMPLANT IN THE BREAST AND WAS DEVASTED WITH THE FACT THAT I HAD CANCER. I HAD THIS PROCEDURE AND HAD THE SAME PLASTIC SURGEON DO THE RECONSTRUCTION WITH A SALINE EXPANDER. THE VERY NEXT MORNING THE PLASTIC SURGEON TOLD ME AT THE HOSP THAT HE WAS SURE THE SALINE HAD RUPTURED AND TO CALL HIM THE FOLLOWING WEEK TO SET UP AN APPOINTMENT TO REPLACE THE SALINE, WHICH I DID. FOLLOWING THIS SALINE IMPLANT I HAD SEVERE REJECTION AND CONTRACTURES WHICH ONCE AGAIN THE IMPLANT STARTED TO MOVE UPWARDS. WENT BACK TO PLASTIC SURGEON WE DISCUSSED THE PAST IMPLANT HISTORY AND THAT THE POLYURETHANE COATED IMPLANTS SEEM TO BE THE ONLY ONES WHICH WORKED. THAT THIS WOULD BE THE ONLY OPTION BUT THAT I HAD TO SIGN A WAIVER. HE NEVER AT ANY TIME INFORMED ME OF THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OR HEALTH RISK INVOLVED WITH THESE TYPES OF IMPLANTS, BUT I HAD NO INFO FROM THE MFR OR INFO REGARDING THESE IMPLANTS NOR DID I KNOW THAT THE FDA STOPPED THE MFRS FROM MAKING THE POLYURETHANE IMPLANTS UNTIL I REQUEST THE BREAST IMPLANT, 1998 FROM THE FDA. I HAD STARTED TO HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS: SKIN RASHES, ALLERGIES, REDNESS, JOINT SWELLING AND SUSPECTED THAT THIS WAS FROM A SEVERE ALLERGY FROM POLYURETHANE COATING, ITCHNESS WITHIN BREAST ESPECIALLY MY LEFT BREAST (MASTY. BREAST). THIS WENT ON FOR OVER SIX YEARS. WENT FROM DR TO DR TO SPECIALIST BACK TO MY OWN DRS, ONCOLOGIST, INTERNIST, GYN, PLASTIC SURGEON AND GOT NO REAL INFO. ALSO HAD SEVERE PAINS IN BOTH BREASTS, CONTRACTIONS. FINALLY IN JUNE OF 1998 AFTER SEEING 11 DERMATOLOGISTS, 2 ALLERGISTS, ETC., I WENT TO SEE MY ONCOLOGIST AND ASKED FOR AN MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING BREAST TEST AND I HAD ONE DONE ON 7/2/98. RESULTS OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING STATE THAT REACTIVE FLUID CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, AND CONTAINED OTHER INFO. I HAD THESE FAXED TO ALL MY DRS, NO ONE GAVE ME ANY INFO REGARDING THIS MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING TEST. WENT AND SAW DRS ONCE AGAIN! GOT NOWHERE; TOLD THEM I THOUGHT IMPLANTS WERE CAUSE OF MY BEING ILL. RASHES, ALLERGIES ARE WORSE THAN MY RIGHT BREAST ENLARGED TO ABOUT TWO SIZES LARGER, RED RASHES, ITCHY, VEINS POPPING, EXTREME PAIN, FEVER IN LEFT BREAST, AND OTHER SYMPTOMS WERE MISSING IN RIGHT BREAST WHEN I DISCOVERED A LUMP UNDER MY RIGHT ARMPIT. CALLED MY BREAST SURGEON GOT AN APPOINTMENT 10/9/98, AND HE GAVE ME ANTIOBIOTICS BUT GAVE ME AN APPOINTMENT AT HIS MEDICAL SUITE TO HAVE A BIOPSY ON 10/14/98. HE REMOVED MY LYMPH NODE AND AFTER PATHOLOGIST REPORT CAME IN AS BENIGN. OTHER REPORTS WERE NOT IN AND I CALLED TO HAVE THEM FAX THE RESULTS AND IT SHOWED I HAD FOREIGN MATERIAL CONSISTENT WITH SILICONE AND THERE WAS A TAN FLESHY SUBSTANCE IN THE RIGHT AUXILLARY LYMPH NODE AND ALSO GIANT REACTIVE FLUID PRESENT, ETC. I FAXED THIS INFO TO MY ONCOLOGIST, PLASTIC SURGEON, WENT TO SEE THEM BUT NOTHING AS FAR AS WHAT I KNEW WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS AND THEIR CONCLUSIONS. FOUND OUT WHO WAS THE MEDICAL ADVISOR AND DIRECTOR FOR CANCER AT THE HOSP WHERE I RESIDE AND WENT TO SEE A DR ON 12/3/98 WITH MY HISTORY. HE JUST CONSULTS AND HE AFTER GOING THROUGH ALL THE PAPERS AND DOCUMENTS I BROUGHT IN CONCURRED WITH ME THAT I NEEDED TO HAVE MY IMPLANTS REMOVED AND RECOMMENDED AND SENT MY INFO TO A DR.

211385|173276|D|1||"RPTR WRITES, ""HAVE AT PRESENT TWO UNIMED UNDERFILLED POLYURETHANE COATED PROSTHESES PRESENTLY. ONE WAS IMPLANTED IN MY LEFT BREAST ON 7/6/90 AFTER HAVING CANCER (MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY ON 1/21/92. I HAD INFILTRATING LOBULAR CARCINOMA AND HAD RECONSTRUCTION AT THE SAME TIME WITH A PLASTIC SURGEON WHO HAD DONE WORK PREVIOUSLY ON MY BREASTS. I WAS FITTED WITH A SALINE EXPANDER. THE PLASTIC SURGEON THE VERY NEXT MORNING AT THE HOSP TOLD ME HE THOUGHT IT HAD RUPTURED AND TO CALL HIM TO MAKE A DATE TO HAVE IT REPLACED AT HIS SURGICAL SUITE. I DID...HE REPLACED IT AND I STARTED TO HAVE PROBLEMS...MY BODY WAS REJECTING THE SALINE...KEPT HAVING CONTRACTURES AND STARTED TO RIDE HIGH AND WAS MOVING UPWARDS. WENT BACK TO THE PLASTIC SURGEON AND WE DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITIES AND HE SUGGESTED I HAVE IT REPLACED WITH THE SAME POLYURETHANE IMPLANT WHICH HE HAD PUT IN, ON 7/6/90, RIGHT AND LEFT BREAST AFTER TAKING THE TWO SILICONES OUT FOR THE SAME REASONS. HE SAID THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE THE FORMATION OF THE SCAR TISSUE WITH THE CAPSULAR CONTRACTIONS. THIS IS HOW I WAS GIVEN A POLYURETHANE COATED IMPLANT IN MY LEFT BREAST (CANCER SIDE - MASTECTOMY). HISTORY: IN 1988 WENT TO SEE THIS PLASTIC SURGEON WHO WAS REFERRED TO ME TO SEE IF HE COULD POSSIBLY STITCH BOTH MY BREASTS UP FOR THEY HAD BECOME EMPTY SACS AFTER I STOPPED MENSTRUATING AND HIS SOLUTION WAS TO AUGMENT THEM AND AFTER CONSIDERATION HE DID AND PUT IN TWO SILICONE IMPLANTS. IN TIME THESE STARTED TO GIVE ME PAIN AND HAD CAPSULAR CONTRACTIONS AND THEY STARTED RIDING HIGH AND THEY WERE SO SEVERE THAT HE SUGGESTED THAT WITH HIS PTS WITH THIS PROBLEM HE OPTED FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE SILICONE AND REPLACE THEM WITH 2 POLYURETHANE IMPLANTS WHICH WOULD ADHERE BETTER AND YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SUCH CONTRACTIONS. I DID THIS AND HAD THIS PROCEDURE PERFORMED AT HIS SURGICAL SUITE ON 7/2/90. SEE NOTES AT END OF HISTORY OF IMPLANTS. HAD REGULAR MAMMOGRAMS AND IN THE LATTER PART OF 1991 I WAS FEELING A LUMP IN MY LEFT BREAST EVEN THOUGH THE LATEST MAMMOGRAM DID NOT SHOW ANYTHING. I REQUESTED ANOTHER MAMMOGRAM AT A DIFFERENT LOCATION AND THIS SHOWED NOTHING. ASKED MY DR IF I COULD HAVE A WRITTEN PRESCRIPTION TO HAVE A SONOGRAM PERFORMED AND I DID AND SURE ENOUGH I DID HAVE A LUMP. WENT TO SEE MY PLASTIC SURGEON AND HE REFERRED ME TO THE ONE OF THE FINEST BREAST SURGEONS. WENT TO SEE HIM FIRST OF JANUARY AND HE SCHEDULED ME FOR A BIOPSY ON 1/13/92 AND WHEN WE GOT THE REPORT BACK IT WAS CANCEROUS AND SO I WENT TO SEE HIM THE NEXT DAY AND WE DISCUSSED THE DIFFERENT PROCEDURES, ETC. AND HE BOOKED ME FOR SURGERY ON 1/21/1992. I OPTED FOR A MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY BECAUSE I DID HAVE THE SILICONE IMPLANT IN THE BREAST AND WAS DEVASTED WITH THE FACT THAT I HAD CANCER. I HAD THIS PROCEDURE AND HAD THE SAME PLASTIC SURGEON DO THE RECONSTRUCTION WITH A SALINE EXPANDER. THE VERY NEXT MORNING THE PLASTIC SURGEON TOLD ME AT THE HOSP THAT HE WAS SURE THE SALINE HAD RUPTURED AND TO CALL HIM THE FOLLOWING WEEK TO SET UP AN APPOINTMENT TO REPLACE THE SALINE, WHICH I DID. FOLLOWING THIS SALINE IMPLANT I HAD SEVERE REJECTION AND CONTRACTURES WHICH ONCE AGAIN THE IMPLANT STARTED TO MOVE UPWARDS.

IN 2/1996 PT WENT FOR THEIR FIRST CONSULTATION WITH THE PLASTIC SURGEON. THE ONLY OTHER COMPLICATIONS THAT HE DISCUSSED WITH PT WERE THE NORMAL RISKS WITH SURGERY, INFECTION AND ANESTHESIA PROBLEMS. WHEN PT GOT THE PAPERWORK TO SIGN WITH NUMEROUS OTHER WARNINGS ON IT PT ASKED QUESTIONS AND WAS ASSURED THAT THOSE WERE ONLY BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE SILICONE -- NOT SALINE. THE OPERATION WAS SCHEDUELD. NINE MONTHS LATER HE SCHEDULED PT FOR ANOTHER OPERATION AS PT HAD DEVELOPED CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. THEY BOTH HAD TO BE REMOVED AND REINSERTED. WITH IN A FEW HOURS ONE OF PT'S IMPLANTS HAD COMPLETELY DEFLATED. PT WAS VERY SCARED AND CALLED THEIR PLASTIC SURGEON'S EMERGENCY SERVICE. PT WAS BACK IN FOR SURGERY TO HAVE THE IMPLANT REPLACED. APPARENTLY THE VALVE HAD FAILED AND LEAKED. HE SAID THAT THIS WAS VERY RARE. SHORTLY AFTER THIS PT STARTED HAVING A LOT OF HEADACHES. PT WAS TREATED FOR MIGRAINES AND ALLERGIES. THEN PT STARTED GETTING SEVERE CRAMPING AND MUSCLE SPASMS IN NECK AND SHOULDERS AND HAD TO BE PUT ON MUSCLE RELAXERS.

PT SAW NUMEROUS DRS AND WAS TREATED WITH ANTI-DEPRESSANTS AS THEY FELT THE ANXIETY WAS CAUSED BY THE CHRONIC PAIN. EVERY FLU OR VIRUS THAT COMES ALONG, PT GETS IT. THE HEADACHES WERE GETTING WORSE AND PT STARTED SEEING NEUROLOGISTS AND CHIROPRACTORS AND MASSAGE THERAPISTS, AND FINALLY A PAIN MANAGEMENT DR AS A LAST RESORT. THANKFULLY, PT DID MENTION IMPLANTS. HE THEN ASKED IF PT HAD EVER HAD A LEAK. PT STARTED RESEARCHING AND BECAME EXTREMELY TERRIFIED AFTER FINDING SEVERAL DIFFERENT WEB SITES WITH OTHER WOMEN'S BREAST IMPLANT HORROR STORIES. AFTER DOING A LOT OF SOUL SEARCHING AND RESEARCH PT DECIDED TO HAVE THEM REMOVED. PT WENT BACK TO IMPLANTING PLASTIC SURGEON TO ASK HIM TO DO IT. PT MENTIONED ALL OF THE INFO FOUND OUT AND TOLD HIM. THEY DID NOT WANT TO RISK HEALTH ANYMORE. HIS ATTITUDE COMPLETELY CHANGED AT THIS POINT. HE SAID THAT PT NEEDED TO WAIT ANOTHER 6 MONTHS AS HE WAS SURE THAT PT WOULD CHANGE THEIR MIND. PT SAID THAT THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF THEM CHANGING THEIR MIND BUT HE WOULDN'T LISTEN. PT TOLD HIM THAT THEY WERE SCARED AND WOULD GLADLY PAY FOR THE OPERATION. PT WASN'T ASKING FOR A FREEBIE. HE TREATED PT HORRIBLY SAYING THAT PT NEEDED TO BE TESTED FOR CANCER AND OTHER DISEASES AS ILLNESSES WERE PROBABLY FROM ONE OF THOSE AND HE COULDN'T OPERATE IF PT HAD CANCER. PT ASSURED HIM SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE CONVERSATION THAT THEY WOULD HAVE ALL OF THE TESTS PERFORMED THAT HE FELT NECESSARY TO RULE THOSE OUT FIRST. AT THIS POINT IN HIS OFFICE PT STARTED CRYING AND BEGGING HIM TO PLEASE PUT THEM ON HIS SCHEDULE AS HE IS PRETTY BOOKED ALL OF THE TIME AND IN THE MEANTIME PT WOULD HAVE ALL OF THE TESTING DONE HE NEEDED. HE WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM WHILE PT WAS TALKING TO HIM. PT HAD ANOTHER APPOINTMENT WITH A DIFFERENT DR. UPON SEEING HIM HE AGREED TO REMOVE THEM BASED ON PT'S FINDINGS AND SCHEDULED OPERATION.

THERE WAS VERY LITTLE CHANGE IN MY BREAST -WEIGHT GAIN AND AGE- AND YOU COULD NOT TELL THAT THE LEFT ONE HAD RUPTURE. I DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG THE IMPLANT HAS BEEN RUPTURED.

NO ONE COULD EXPLAIN WHAT WAS GOING ON, BUT THE GENERAL CONSENSUS WAS THAT I HAD FIBROMYALGIA. TEN MONTHS LATER, I NOTICED THAT MY BREASTS WERE BEGINNING TO HARDEN AND WERE VERY TENDER. I WENT TO THE PLASTI C SURGEON WHO PERFORMED THE SILICONE IMPLANT SURGERY. HE DETERMINED THAT I HAD CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. AT THE SAME TIME, I BEGAN TO RESEARCH PROBLEMS WITH SILICONE IMPLANTS. MY SYMPTOMS WERE THE SAME AS MANY WOMEN WHO RECEIVED SILICONE IMPLANTS. MY SYMPTOMS WERE ALSO CONSISTENT WITH PLATINUM POISONING. PLATINUM IS THE MATERIAL USED TO MAKE THE SILICONE IMPLANTS MORE GEL-LIKE. ONE MONTH AGO, I HAD THE SILICONE IMPLANTS REMOVED. MY HEALTH HAS IMPROVED DRAMATICALLY DURING THE PAST MONTH. MANY OF MY HEALTH ISSUES HAVE DISAPPEARED OR HAVE LESSENED CONSIDERABLY.  TWO MONTHS AGO, I BELIEVED I WAS DYING, I PRAYED FOR DIRECTION, BECAUSE I THOUGHT I HAD EXHAUSTED EVERY MEDICAL OPTION.

I NEVER GUESSED THAT MY HEALTH ISSUES COULD BE CONNECTED TO MY NEW, SILICONE IMPLANTS. I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT MANY WOMEN IN SIMILAR RESEARCH STUDIES WOULD MAKE THE SAME ASSUMPTION.

I HAD SILICONE LEAKING OUT OF NIPPLE AREAS, CHEST WALL INFLAMMATION, HIGH FEVERS, MUSCLE PAIN/WEAKNESS/FATIGUE, SKIN LESIONS, DRY EYES, MOUTH, JOINT PAIN, NUMBNESS OF EXTREMITIES, NERVOUS SYSTEM DAMAGE. IN 1993, AFTER RUPTURE WAS DETECTED THESE IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED. THE FINDINGS WERE THE CAPSULE IN THE BREAST DOES NOT CONTAIN THE LOOSE SILICONE, AS MINE HAD MIGRATED TO MY LEFT AXILLA AREA AGAIN. SURGERY PROVED IT TO BE CAUSED BY RESIDUAL SILICONE IN THIS AREA FROM RUPTURE, AND INFILTRATED MY LYMPH NODES WHICH WERE CALCIFIED AND REMOVED. IN 2002, 6 YEARS LATER, I HAD A 5.5CC CANCEROUS TUMOR REMOVED FROM THE EXACT SAME AXILLA AREA AS PRIOR. THE TUMOR HAD SILICONE IN IT, WAS CLASSIFIED AS A RARE LIPOSARCOMA. THE ONCOLOGIST AND MY DOCTORS, SURGEON ALL AGREED THIS WAS NOT A COINCIDENCE THAT I HAD A MALIGNANT TUMOR IN THE EXACT AREA RESIDUAL SILICONE HAD BEEN FOUND YEARS PRIOR. I HAVE NO HISTORY OF CANCER OR TUMORS IN MY FAMILY OR ANY AUTO-IMMUNE DISEASE WHICH I NOW SUFFER SINCE I WILL ALWAYS HAVE THE LOOSE SILICONE WHICH WAS NOT ABLE TO BE REMOVED. THIS CAUSES A PERMANENT ""INFLAMMATORY"" RESPONSE IN THE BODY. I NOW WILL ALWAYS HAVE TO BE SCREENED FOR CANCER DUE TO THE TUMOR. I HAD BEEN A HEALTHY, ATHLETIC GIRL WHEN MY SILICONE IMPLANTS WERE PUT IN MY BODY. I AM NOW A ""SURVIVOR"" OF THE FALSE INFO GIVEN AND WHICH IS STILL BEING PUT OUT. THREE YEARS IS NOT ENOUGH TIME TO STUDY WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS. MINE DID NOT RUPTURE FOR 9 YEARS, AND THE SYMPTOMS WERE SUBTLE AND SLOW IN THE BEGINNING. I AM NOT AN UNUSUAL CASE. THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF OTHERS JUST LIKE ME WITH NO PRIOR ILLNESS WHO ARE NOW SUFFERING PERMANENT ILLNESS DUE TO LOOSE SILICONE IN THEIR BODIES. IF I HAD KNOWN ALL THE RESEARCH AND TRUTH REGARDING SILICONE IN THE BODY, I WOULD NEVER HAVE HAD PLACED THEM IN MY BODY.

THE WEATHER WAS EXTREMELY COLD, -16 DEGREES IN THE EVENINGS. AS THE DRIVE INTO THE MOUNTAINS CLIMBED IN ELEVATION FROM (B)(6), I BEGAN TO HAVE SHALLOW BREATHING. I REMAINED CLAM AND KEPT MY BREATHING SLOW TO AVOID PANIC. WHEN I GOT OUT OF THE CAR, MY MOVEMENTS WERE EXTREMELY SLOW AND RESTRICTED. I FELT IT NECESSARY TO PAY ATTENTION TO MY BREATH, THE SHALLOWNESS WAS VERY PRESENT WITH HEAVINESS IN MY CHEST, AND I COULD NOT FILL MY LUNGS AS I NORMALLY COULD. THROUGHOUT THE NEXT TWO DAYS, I WAS RESTRICTED IN MOVEMENT IN THAT I COULD NOT BREATHE TO COMPLETE NORMAL DAILY TASKS. WALKING ACROSS THE ROOM CAUSED ME TO STOP AND CATCH MY BREATH. MY FAMILY AND I TREATED THIS SYMPTOM AS ALTITUDE SICKNESS. I HAVE NEVER HAD ALTITUDE SICKNESS WITH ANY PRIOR VISITS TO (B)(6). MY LAST VISIT WAS (B)(6) 2010 WITH NO SYMPTOMS WHAT SO EVER. I CONTEMPLATED, MANY TIMES, IF I SHOULD GO TO THE ER BUT KEPT FAITH IN THAT IT WOULD SUBSIDE BY DRINKING WATER AS IF IT REALLY WERE ALTITUDE SICKNESS. AS INTENSE HEADACHE DEVELOPED THAT ENVELOPED MY ENTIRE CRANIUM. I DO NOT HAVE ISSUES WITH HEADACHES, CERTAINLY NOT ONE THIS INTENSE. I FELT HANDICAPPED. I AM NOT HANDICAPPED. I AM A NORMALLY FUNCTIONING HEALTHY CAPABLE WOMAN WHOSE BREATH WAS COMPROMISED BY PRESSURE IN THE CHEST. MY IMPLANTS WERE TIGHTER THAN NORMAL, LARGER AS IF THEY WERE SWOLLEN. ON THE DRIVE BACK TO (B)(6), THERE WAS A POINT WHERE MY BREATH RETURNED TO NORMAL. IT WAS ABOUT THE SAME AREA WHERE IT WAS SHORTENED ON THE WAY UP.

THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED SINCE THEY WERE PUT IN (B)(6) 2007. THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT WOULD RESULT IN A LOUD PROMINENT SLOSHING SOUND THAT COULD BE HEARD BY OTHERS IN THE ROOM. THEIR FORM REMAINED NORMAL. I COULDN'T TELL IF THE NOISE WAS COMING FROM INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF THE IMPLANT. THE SKIN AROUND THE IMPLANT SEEMED NORMAL AS WELL. I WAS UP ALL NIGHT EVALUATING IF THEY WERE LEAKING OR NOT. I FOUND IT ODD THAT THEY WOULD BOTH LEAK BUT THE NOISES CAME EQUALLY FROM BOTH SIDES. WITHIN A 24 HOUR TIME SPAN, THE NOISES WERE JUST ABOUT GONE. THERE ISN'T A DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT MY IMPLANTS REACTED TO THE INTENSE COLD AND THE ELEVATION OF THE AREA I VISITED.

A LARGE, LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP FOUND NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE RISK RATES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CANCERS, INCLUDING STOMACH CANCER, LEUKEMIA, AND LYMPHOMA. IN THE (B)(4) STUDY, AT LEAST 1 REOPERATION WAS PERFORMED ON 315 PTS (36.5%) THROUGH 10 YEARS. A TOTAL OF 424 REOPERATIONS WERE PERFORMED. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR REOPERATION THROUGH 10 YEARS ON AUGMENTATION PATIENTS WAS IMPLANT DEFLATION AT 21.7%. THE PERCENTAGE OF REOPERATIONS DUE TO LUMP/MASS/CYST INCREASED FROM 8.5% OF 293 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 5 YEARS TO 13.9% OF 424 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 10 YEARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF LUMPS, MASSES, AND CYSTS CAN BE EXPECTED TO NATURALLY INCREASE AS PTS AGE AND COULD BE AN EXPLANATION FOR THE INCREASE. IN RARE INSTANCES, ACUTE INFECTION MAY OCCUR IN A BREAST WITH IMPLANTS. THE SIGNS OF ACUTE INFECTION INCLUDE ERYTHEMA, TENDERNESS, FLUID ACCUMULATION, PAIN, AND FEVER. VERY RARELY, TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME, A POTENTIALLY LIFE-THREATENING CONDITION, HAS BEEN REPORTED IN WOMEN AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY. IT IS CHARACTERIZED BY SYMPTOMS THAT OCCUR SUDDENLY AND INCLUDE HIGH FEVER (102 DEGREE F, 38.8 DEGREE C OR HIGHER), VOMITING, DIARRHEA, A SUNBURN-LIKE RASH, RED EYES, DIZZINESS, LIGHTHEADEDNESS, MUSCLE ACHES, AND DROPS IN BLOOD PRESSURE, WHICH MAY CAUSE FAINTING. PTS SHOULD BE ADVISED TO CONTACT A PHYSICIAN IMMEDIATELY FOR DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT FOR ANY OF THESE SYSTEMS.

USE CARE IN SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURES SUCH AS OPEN CAPSULOTOMY, BREAST POCKET REVISION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA ASPIRATION, AND BIOPSY/LUMPECTOMY TO AVOID DAMAGE TO THE IMPLANT. PT SHOULD PERFORM BREAST SELF-EXAMINATIONS MONTHLY AND BE SHOWN HOW TO DISTINGUISH THE IMPLANT FROM THEIR BREAST TISSUE. THE PT SHOULD NOT MANIPULATE OR SQUEEZE THE EXCESSIVELY. THE PT SHOULD BE TOLD THAT THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGE IN THE IMPLANT SHAPE MAY BE SIGNS OF SYMPTOMATIC RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. IF THE PT HAS ANY OF THESE SIGNS, SHE SHOULD BE TOLD TO REPORT THEM, AND POSSIBLY HAVE AN MRI EVAL TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. THE NATRELLE CORE STUDY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE LONG-TERM (10 YEARS) SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PROD. IN ADDITION, ALLERGAN HAS INITIATED A SEPARATE LARGE 10-YEAR POSTAPPROVAL STUDY (BREAST IMPLANT F/U STUDIES, OR BIFS) TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC ISSUES WHICH ALLERGAN'S CORE STUDY WAS NOT DESIGNED TO FULLY ANSWER, AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE A REAL-WORLD ASSESSMENT OF SOME ENDPOINTS. THE ENDPOINTS IN THE BIFS LARGE POSTAPPROVAL STUDY INCLUDE LONG-TERM LOCAL COMPLICATIONS, CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE (CTD), CTD SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS, NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE, NEUROLOGICAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS, OFFSPRING ISSUES, REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES, CANCER SUICIDE, MAMMOGRAPHY ISSUES, AND MRI COMPLIANCE AND RESULTS.

5155756|28464643|N|0||DEVICE LABELING: PUBLISHED STUDIES INDICATE THAT BREAST CANCER IS NO MORE COMMON IN WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS THAN THOSE WITHOUT IMPLANTS. A LARGE, LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP FOUND NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE RISK RATES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CANCERS, INCLUDING STOMACH CANCER, LEUKEMIA, AND LYMPHOMA. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, ASYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. DEFLATION Â¿ BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS DEFLATE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. DEFLATION CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO DEFLATE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS; FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL; EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED); TRAUMA; COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING; AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME.

PATIENT IDENTIFIER (B)(6) RELATES TO PATIENTS' RECORD PREVIOUSLY EXISTING IN (B)(6) DATABASE. CURRENT DATABASE PATIENT IDENTIFIER IS PR: (B)(6). DEVICE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. CALCIUM DEPOSITS CAN FORM IN THE TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT WITH SYMPTOMS THAT MAY INCLUDE PAIN AND FIRMNESS. LYMPHADENOPATHY HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED IN SOME WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS. THE NATRELLE CORE STUDY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE LONG-TERM (10 YEARS) SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, ALLERGAN HAS INITIATED A SEPARATE LARGE 10-YEAR POST-APPROVAL STUDY (THE BREAST IMPLANT FOLLOW-UP STUDIES, OR BIFS) TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC ISSUES WHICH ALLERGAN'S CORE STUDY WAS NOT DESIGNED TO FULLY ANSWER, AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE A REAL-WORLD ASSESSMENT OF SOME ENDPOINTS. THE ENDPOINTS IN THE BIFS LARGE POST-APPROVAL STUDY INCLUDE LONG-TERM LOCAL COMPLICATIONS, CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE (CTD), CTD SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS, NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE, NEUROLOGICAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS, OFFSPRING ISSUES, REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES, LACTATION ISSUES, CANCER, SUICIDE, MAMMOGRAPHY ISSUES, AND MRI COMPLIANCE AND RESULTS. ALLERGAN WILL UPDATE THEIR LABELING ON A REGULAR BASIS WITH THE RESULTS OF THESE TWO STUDIES. THERE WAS 1 PRIMARY AUGMENTATION PATIENT WITH A NEW DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER THROUGH 7 YEARS IN THE CORE STUDY. THERE WAS A 13% BENIGN BREAST DISEASE RATE AND A 1% MALIGNANT BREAST DISEASE RATE. FOR REVISION-AUGMENTATION PATIENTS, THERE WAS 1 PATIENT WITH A NEW DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER. THERE WAS A 15% BENIGN BREAST DISEASE RATE AND A 1% MALIGNANT BREAST DISEASE RATE THROUGH 7 YEARS. IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION PATIENTS THERE WAS 1 REPORT OF THYROID CANCER AND 1 REPORT OF BRAIN CANCER. THERE WERE NO REPORTS OF OTHER CANCERS, SUCH AS RESPIRATORY OR CERVICAL/VULVAR, IN REVISION-AUGMENTATION PATIENTS. THERE WERE 8 PRIMARY RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS (8%) WITH NEW REPORTS OF BREAST CANCER THROUGH 7 YEARS IN THE CORE STUDY. THERE WAS A 17% BENIGN BREAST DISEASE RATE AND A 10% MALIGNANT BREAST DISEASE RATE THROUGH 7 YEARS. FOR REVISION RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS, THERE WERE NO REPORTS OF NEW DIAGNOSES OR REOCCURRENCE OF BREAST CANCER. THERE WAS A 7% BENIGN BREAST DISEASE RATE THROUGH 7 YEARS.

5306250|33911734|D|1||"TWENTY YEARS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE CONTENTIOUSNESS AND CONFUSION BEGAN TO DOMINATE THE ISSUE OF SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANTS. IN EARLY 1992, THE WORLD LITERATURE ON THIS TOPIC COULD BE SUMMED UP IN ONE SENTENCE: SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANTS, WHEN INSERTED INTO A LIVE HUMAN BEING, HAD THE CAPACITY TO MAKE THE RECIPIENT ILL. THE LITERATURE DID NOT SPECIFICALLY STATE THAT THE ILLNESS WAS, NOR DID IT DEDUCE WITH CERTAINTY THAT THERE EVEN WAS SUCH AS ILLNESS. SUBSEQUENTLY THERE TRANSPIRED A GRIEVOUS AND FUNDAMENTAL ERROR IN REASONING: SILICONE-INDUCED DISEASE WAS DEFINED IN THE COURTROOM BEFORE IT WAS ADEQUATELY STUDIED IN THE EXAM ROOM. STATED MORE SIMPLY, PLAINTIFF AND DEFENSE LAWYERS WENT TO THE RHEUMATOLOGY TEXTBOOK, LISTED THE CRITERIA FOR CLASSICAL CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE (LUPUS, ETC.), AND FORGED A GLOBAL CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT STATING THAT IF ANYONE BECAME ILL WITH SUCH A DISORDER THEY WOULD BE COMPENSATED. A FEW OTHER CATEGORIES WERE DEFINED FOR THE STRAGGLERS, NAMELY ""ATYPICAL CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE"" AND ""ATYPICAL NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE,"" WHOSE CRITERIA WERE ALSO BASED ON A PRECONCEIVED IDEA OF HOW THE WOMEN WERE SUPPOSED TO BECOME ILL. THE STAGE WAS NOW SET FOR CHAOS, WHICH ENSUED SHORTLY THEREAFTER AS A RESULT. OF THREE EVENTS: INSTEAD OF 400,000 SHOWED UP; THERE WAS A TIMETABLE TO GET ALL OF THE WOMEN EXAMINED (BY AUGUST OF 1994); AND THE LEGAL DEFINITION OF SILICONE TOXICITY BECAME ADOPTED AS THE MEDICAL DEFINITION. EXAMINATIONS OF BREAST IMPLANT RECIPIENTS WERE INVARIABLY GEARED TOWARD GATHERING JUST ENOUGH INFO TO PLACE WOMEN ON A LEGAL COMPENSABLE GRID. STATED ANOTHER WAY, THE DISORDER WAS STUDIED FOR WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE RATHER THAN FOR WHAT IT WAS. BY FAILING TO CONSIDER MULTIPLE POTENTIAL MECHANISMS OF DISEASE CAUSATION, DATABASES WERE ARTIFICIALLY TRUNCATED AND ONLY A FRACTION OF THE WOMEN'S AILMENTS WERE RECORDED. A FURTHER LEAP OF FAITH TRANSPIRED WHEN IT WAS ASSUMED THAT THE INFLAMMATION MANIFESTED IN THE LOCAL BREAST MILIEU WOULD INVARIABLY PRECIPITATE AND BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SYSTEMIC PHENOMENA. SOONER OR LATER, ALONG THE WAY, THE IMMUNOLOGISTS WOULD BAIL EVERYONE OUT BY COMING UP WITH THE PROPER DIAGNOSTIC TESTS. THIS ABERRANT AND CONTRIVED METHODOLOGY PERMEATED THE THOUGHT PROCESSES OF NEARLY ALL INVESTIGATORS, YIELDING THE DUBIOUS DISTINCTION FOUR YEARS LATER OF HAVING OVER 200,000 WOMEN EXAMINED AND VERY LITTLE USEFUL DATA (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ESCALATING REPORTS OF DEVICE RUPTURE). ONCE THE ILLNESS WAS DEFINED BY ATTORNEYS ON A FICTITIOUS BASIS, IT WAS A SIMPLE MATTER FOR IMPLANT MFRS TO FUND STUDIES TO SHOW THAT THE FICTITIOUS ILLNESS DIDN'T EXIST. THIS PROVED VERY EFFECTIVE IN THE PUBLIC ARENA VIA A SIMPLE SLIGHT-OF-HAND ILLUSION: IF A SICK BREAST IMPLANT RECIPIENT DOESN'T HAVE ""A"" (SOMETHING IN THE TEXTBOOK), THEN SHE DOESN'T HAVE ""B"" (SOMETHING NEW), I. E., SHE HAS NOTHING. THIS SERVED TO HEIGHTEN THE VOCIFEROUS EFFORTS OF THE BREAST IMPLANT RECIPIENTS THEMSELVES, BECAUSE NOW THEY FELT VICTIMIZED TWICE: ONCE BY A FAULTY PRODUCT THAT MADE THEM ILL, AND SECOND BY CLEVER MANIPULATION OF MISLEADING DATA. LITTLE DID THEY REALIZE THAT MEDIA COVERAGE WOULD CIRCUITOUSLY COME BACK TO HAUNT THEM WHEREBY WOMEN WERE BLAMED FOR INVENTING THE ILLNESS AFTER HEARING ABOUT IT. SYMPATHETIC INVESTIGATORS WERE BESIEGED BY AN ARMY OF COMPANY RESEARCHERS WHO CONDUCTED CRITICAL AND SCATHING REVIEWS OF THE THEORIES AND PREMISES OF SILICONE-INDUCED IMMUNE ACTIVATION. THE TRASHING OF IMMUNOTOXIC MECHANISMS PARALLELED THE VACUUM CREATED BY THE LACK OF CAREFUL AND METICULOUS BEDSIDE OBSERVATIONS, RENDERING DISEASE VERIFICATION ELUSIVE. PLAINTIFF'S LAWYERS BEGAN REELING FORM A SUCCESSION OF ADVERSE JURY VERDICTS, AND WERE LEFT WONDERING WHY THEIR ""SCIENCE"" WASN'T YIELDING BETTER RESULTS. THE FINAL NAILS IN THE COFFIN WERE PROVIDED BY NUMEROUS ERUDITE SCIENTIFIC PANELS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, (B)(6), ALL OF WHOM DEDUCED THAT NOT ENOUGH DATA WAS PRESENT TO REACH ANY DEFINITIVE CONCLUSION ON CAUSATION. THE CURRENT CRISIS DEVELOPING SIMULTANEOUSLY IN MANY COUNTRIES OVER THE ISSUE OF SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANTS HAS THREE COMPONENTS, ALL APPARENTLY LINKED TO DEVICES MANUFACTURED BY POLY IMPLANT PROTHESE (A COMPANY KNOWN AS PIP): AN UNUSUALLY HIGH RATE OF RUPTURE, THE SUBSTITUTION OF SUBSTANDARD ""INDUSTRIAL GRADE"" SILICONE FOR CONVENTIONAL ""MEDICAL GRADE"" SILICONE, AND THE POTENTIAL PROPENSITY TO PRODUCE A RARE FORM OF CANCER KNOWN AS ANAPLASTIC LARGE-CELL LYMPHOMA. WITH REGARD TO RUPTURE, IT WOULD NOT BE SURPRISING IN THE FUTURE TO DISCOVER THAT DEVICES FROM ANY MFR WERE READILY FAILING AT THE RATE OF FIVE PERCENT PER YEAR. WITH REGARD TO CANCER, A DISCUSSION OF THAT ISSUE IS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THIS EDITORIAL."|DEVICE - SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT||11/17/2015||||*|*||I|FTR|1.0||DEVICE - SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|||||||POLY IMPLANT PROTHESE (PIP)|||||||True

I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A PHYSICALLY ACTIVE PERSON. I WAS A CLASSICAL BALLET DANCER ON A PROFESSIONAL TRACK. SINCE THE AGE OF 11, I DANCED IN A COMPANY, AND LATER, MOVED INTO TEACHING BALLET FOR A COMPETITIVE GYMNASTICS TEAM. OVER THE YEARS SINCE RECEIVING IMPLANTS MY HEALTH HAS STEADILY DECLINED AND ALL SYMPTOMS HAVE CONSISTENTLY WORSENED. THEY HAVE COME TO A HEAD DURING THE LAST 2 TO 3 YEARS. THE WORST PART OF THAT DECLINE IS SEVERE, DEBILITATING FATIGUE WITH SEVERE PAIN AND INJURY WITH ANY EXERTION AND HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, DEBILITATING MIGRAINES. BUT THOSE ARE CERTAINLY NOT MY ONLY SYMPTOMS. I HAVE BROUGHT MY ISSUES TO MY PCPS OVER THE LAST YEARS. THEY TESTED ME FOR A FEW POSSIBLE COMMON CAUSES, BUT COULDN'T FIND A REASON. EVENTUALLY, THEY JUST IGNORED THESE SYMPTOMS. I RECENTLY CHANGED PCPS AND MY NEW ONE BEGAN A DILIGENT PROCESS OF ELIMINATION. SHE HAS BEEN SENDING ME TO SPECIALISTS AND WE'VE BEEN DOING ONE TEST AFTER ANOTHER TO RULE THINGS OUT. THEY'VE ALL COME OUT NORMAL. UNTIL WE DID A BREAST ULTRASOUND. IT SHOWED SIGNS OF IMPLANT RUPTURE. I WAS SENT TO DO AN MRI, AND IT CONFIRMED IMPLANT RUPTURE. DUE TO MY MASTECTOMIES, I HAVE NO SENSATION IN MY BREAST OR ARMPIT AREAS, SO WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG AGO THE RUPTURE TOOK PLACE. BECAUSE SILENT RUPTURES ARE COMMON, THE RUPTURE COULD HAVE HAPPENED YEARS AGO. THE CHANGE IN SHAPE AND SIZE AND THEIR ASYMMETRY HAS BEEN NOTICEABLE FOR SOME YEARS, BUT MY PREVIOUS PCP HAD NO COMMENT ABOUT THAT. I AM EXTREMELY UPSET THAT I WAS NOT SENT FOR A BREAST ULTRASOUND OR OTHER RELATED TEST BY MY PREVIOUS PCP. ALL THE LITERATURE SAYS THAT PEOPLE WITH BREAST IMPLANTS SHOULD BE FOLLOWED ON A REGULAR BASIS. I AM EXTREMELY THANKFUL THAT I HAVE FOUND A DILIGENT PCP AND AN NOW IN GOOD CARE. I KNOW THAT A CONNECTION BETWEEN IMPLANTS AND RUPTURED IMPLANTS AND HEALTH ISSUES ISN'T SOMETHING THE MAJORITY OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION WANTS TO ADMIT, BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE CONNECTION IS REAL.

AND THESE ARE ONLY THE WOMEN WITH WHOM I HAVE CONNECTED. THERE MUST BE SO MANY MORE OUT THERE. THE WORST PART OF ALL THIS IS THAT OUR CONDITIONS ARE BEING IGNORED OR POO-POOED BY THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY SO THERE IS OFTEN NO HELP FOR US UNLESS AND UNTIL WE CAN FIND A DOCTOR WHO TAKES OUT HEALTH SERIOUSLY.

SO MAYBE THE FDA SHOULD HAVE MADE ME AWARE OF HOW UNSAFE SILICONE IMPLANTS BY THIS COMPANY INNAMED OR MCGHAN STYLE 153 DOUBLE LUMEN. THE MRI I DID HAVE COULD NOT TELL FOR SURE ANYTHING I THOUGHT IT COULD HAVE A RUPTURE IN ONE BREAST. THIS ONE HAD BEEN REPLACED PREVIOUSLY BY MY FORMER SURGEON AND THE BREAST HAD CAPSULAR CONTRACTION, WAS HARD A ROCK. THIS ONE WAS REPLACED BY FORMER SURGEON AFTER THE ORIGINAL SURGERY IN 2002 - 2003. SO I WAS SHOCKED TO LEARN THESE IMPLANTS WERE NOT WHAT I HAD THOUGHT I WAS GETTING, AND WHEN I CALLED TO FIND OUT ANY INFO I WAS GIVEN, THE RUN AROUND SAYING I WAS NOT ON THE LIST BY MFR OF BOTH OF THE CURRENT COMPANIES OF THIS TYPE OF IMPLANT WHICH IS EVEN MORE UNSAFE FOR THE PUBLIC, AND GOD KNOWS I HAVE SUFFERED MYSELF NOW FOR YEARS WITH UNEXPLAINED PAIN IN MY ARMS, TIREDNESS AND THE STRESS OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HECK WAS WRONG WITH ME. SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE. THIS IS JUST NOT FAIR. WE ARE AT OUR LOWEST WHEN WE LEARN OF THE CANCER AND ARE TRYING TO PREVENT ANYTHING MORE SERIOUS FROM HAPPENING. SINCE I HAD 4 CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 18 AT THE TIME OF MY SURGERY YEARS AGO TO LEARN. YEARS LATER THE PERSON I TRUSTED LIED AND MY GOVERNMENT IS NOT WATCHING OUT FOR OUR SAFETY THIS MAKES ME VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE USA WHEN EUROPE HAS BETTER SAFETY MEASURES IN PLACE FOR THE CITIZENS OF THEIR COUNTRY. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST DEVICE AND I'M SURE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE LAST SINCE MY DAUGHTER IS SUFFERING FROM A DIFFERENT DEVICE, AND NO ONE CARES ABOUT THAT EITHER. SHE HAS TRIED TO CALL ABOUT IT AND NO RESPONSE. VERY SAD. HOPEFULLY IT NEVER HAPPENS TO SOMEONE YOU LIVE.|BREAST IMPLANT STYLE 153||01/13/2016||||*|*||I|FTR|1.0||BREAST IMPLANT STYLE 153|||||||MCGHAN|||||153||True
5662236|45486775|D|1||I AM A BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR. I HAD ALLERGAN 410 HIGHLY COHESIVE SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLANTS PUT IN AND THEY ALMOST KILLED ME! PLEASE TAKE THEM BACK OFF THE MARKET. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE MAKING A LOT OF MONEY OF THESE ON THE MARKET AT OUR EXPENSE. I DON'T THINK I NEED TO GO INTO HOW THEY ALMOST KILLED MY BODY AS I HAVE SEEN WHERE MANY WOMEN HAVE BEEN COMPLAINING ABOUT THESE IMPLANTS AND NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE ABOUT IT.

5935385|54346448|D|1||IN (B)(6) 2003, I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER IN MY LEFT BREAST. I HAD A LUMPECTOMY WITH MULTIPLE LYMPH NODE REMOVAL AND WAS SCHEDULED FOR 40 ROUNDS OF RADIATION. BECAUSE I HAVE A SKIN DISORDER CALLED SOLAR URTICARIA, I KNEW I COULD NOT DO RADIATION BUT DOCTORS IN MY TOWN DID NOT KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT IT TO SAY YES OR NO. I WENT TO (B)(6) CLINIC DOWN IN (B)(6) AND HAD A BILATERAL MASTECTOMY. IN (B)(6) 2004, I HAD MY SURGERY WITH TEMPORARY EXPANDERS. WHEN MY BREAST WERE READY WE EXCHANGED THEM FOR SILICONE IMPLANTS. IN (B)(6) OF THAT SAME YEAR 2004, I BECAME ILL WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND WAS PLACED ON TWO MEDICINES. IN 2009, I HAD TO HAVE MY IMPLANTS REPLACED BECAUSE OF A RUPTURE IN THE RIGHT IMPLANT. THEY WERE REPLACED WITH A SECOND PAIR OF SILICONE IMPLANTS. I BECAME SERIOUSLY ILL IN (B)(6) OF 2012 WITH COLLAGENOUS COLITIS, HOSPITALIZED AND BATTLED THAT THREE SEPARATE TIMES. I WAS PUT ON A GLUTEN FREE, LOW-FAT, LOW FIBER RESIDUAL DIET FROM A VERY RENOWNED LOCAL G. I. DOCTOR. I TRIED AND EXPERIENCED A 2 GALLON (B)(6) BAG OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT DID NOT WORK FOR ME DURING THIS ENTIRE JOURNEY. A DIET THAT I STILL PRACTICE TO THIS DAY. I CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE STOMACH PAIN AND EXTREME NAUSEA. I BEGAN TO HAVE SEVERE JOINT AND MUSCLE ACHES WORSE THEN MY RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS HAD EVER BEEN. I SAW YET ANOTHER G. I. DOCTOR FROM (B)(6) (ONE OF THE BEST) AND VISITED (B)(6) CLINIC BOTH G. I., DEPARTMENT AND RHEUMATOLOGY TWO TIMES IN TWO SEPARATE YEARS. I'VE HAD ENDLESS COLONOSCOPIES, ENDOSCOPIES, BRAIN SCANS, PANCREAS PROTOCOL, EXTENSIVE BLOODWORK, 2 GASTRIC EMPTYING TEST, WITH ONE TEST INDICATING POSITIVE AT (B)(6). HOWEVER, THE SECOND TEST AT (B)(6) CLINIC SHOWED NEGATIVE. EVERY ORGAN IN MY BODY WAS CHECKED AND RECHECKED. SO ONCE AGAIN MY ILLNESS WAS UNDETERMINED AND UNEXPLAINED! NOW I HAD BEEN 3 1/2 YEARS. THANK GOODNESS I RETIRED THE YEAR I GOT ILL OR I WOULD HAVE BEEN FORCED TO QUIT. I FINALLY WAS TOLD BY THE RHEUMATOLOGIST AT (B)(6) CLINIC THAT IT WAS FIBROMYALGIA. IN (B)(6) 2016, I FOUND A SPECIALIST DR. (B)(6) IN (B)(6). HE FOUND OUT THAT I ALSO HAD MANY FOOD ALLERGIES, FOUR ACTIVE DNA CHILDHOOD VIRUSES AND A DEFICIENCY IN VITAMIN D. ALTHOUGH ONCE HE FOUND OUT I HAD BREAST IMPLANTS SILICONE, HE SUGGESTED I GET THEM OUT IMMEDIATELY. I HAD SPOKEN WITH MY PLASTIC SURGEON A YEAR AND A HALF AGO ABOUT THIS VERY ISSUE OF MY IMPLANTS BECAUSE MY RIGHT IMPLANT HAD BEEN BOTHERING ME AGAIN AND I WAS IN FEAR OF ANOTHER RUPTURE. WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM ABOUT WHAT DR. (B)(6) HAD SUGGESTED HE ALSO AGREED. I HAD AN EXPLANT ON (B)(6) 2016. I'M WRITING THIS ON (B)(6) 2016. NOTE: WHEN I WOKE UP FROM ANESTHESIA AFTER EXPLANT I HAD 0 JOINT PAIN. WE ARE WAITING FOR THE OTHER SYMPTOMS TO EITHER DISAPPEAR OR DIMINISH. OUT OF THE 63 SYMPTOMS OF BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESS, I HAD 36! THEREFORE, IT WILL TAKE ME A LONG TIME FOR MY BODY TO RECOVER, IF EVER FULLY. THIS DECISION TO REMOVE MY BREASTS FOR THE 2ND TIME WAS A DIFFICULT ONE ESPECIALLY WITH THIS OUTCOME. I DO NOT HAVE BREASTS BECAUSE OF MY BILATERAL MASTECTOMY. MY PLASTIC SURGEON DID A WONDERFUL JOB USING FAT TRANSFER FROM MY ABDOMEN IN ORDER TO FILL IN THE HOLES IN MY CHEST. YOU SEE, I'M VERY THIN. WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN VERY ILL FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS. I DID NOT HAVE MUCH FAT AT ALL TO HELP WITH THIS PROCEDURE. TODAY, I SAW MY PLASTIC SURGEON AND HE HAD TO DRAIN FLUID FROM THIS RIGHT BREAST AGAIN. SO WE ARE STILL DEALING WITH THIS SITUATION. BUT I AM OPTIMISTIC THAT REMOVING THE IMPLANTS WERE MY LAST HOPE AND GETTING MY BODY HEALTHY AGAIN. I TRULY BELIEVE THAT MY IMPLANTS CAUSED MY ILLNESS AND THAT OTHER WOMEN HEAR MY STORY.|SILICONE IMPLANTS||09/02/2016||||*|*||I|FTR|2.0||SILICONE IMPLANTS|||||||MENTOR|||||||True
