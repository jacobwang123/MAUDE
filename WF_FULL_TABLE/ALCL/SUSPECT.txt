I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT THE FDA ALLOWED MENTOR TO COMPLETE THEIR OWN STUDIES AND SO EASILY ALLOWED THEM BACK ON THE MARKET AFTER ONLY 3 YEARS SO THAT THIS IMPLANT COMPANY AND PLASTIC SURGEONS COULD MAKE MONEY. THIS IS FIVE YEARS OF MY LIFE I CAN'T GET BACK. FIVE YEARS OF BEING SICK. FIVE YEARS OF MEDICATING MY BODY WHEN IT WAS TRYING TO SAY PLEASE GET THESE OUT OF ME. PLEASE TAKE THESE OFF THE MARKET.

14056|10976|D|1||SHORTLY AFTER HAVING HER SECOND BREAST IMPLANTS, RPTR HAD A SEVERE CASE OF SHINGLES. SHE HAS LARGE SCARS ON HER LEFT SHOULDER. THE NERVES WERE DAMAGED SO BADLY THAT SHE STILL HAS HOT TINGLING SENSATIONS AND PAIN REGULARLY. AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH RAYNAUD'S PHENOMENON. SHE TOLD HER DR WHEN HER HANDS GOT COLD THEY TURNED BLUE, THEN BLACK BEFORE ALL THE BLOOD DRAINED FROM THEM AND THEY TURNED TRANSPARENT. SHE SAYS THEY CAN BE VERY PAINFUL. HANDLING ANYTHING COLD OR EVEN DRINKING SOMETHING COLD CAN BRING ON THE PROBLEM. HER FEET ARE THE SAME. HER TOES AND TOENAILS ARE SORE AROUND THE EDGES. ALSO HER HANDS OFTEN GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT WAKING HER UP. SHE ALSO DEVELOPED ARTHRITIS SYMPTOMS. SHE BEGAN TO SUSPECT A PROBLEM WHEN SHE HAD A COLD THAT LASTED APPROX 2 YRS. ANTIBIOTICS DIDN'T SEEM TO HELP HER MUCH. HER DR SENT HER FOR MAMMOGRAMS AND X-RAYS BUT DID NOT FIND ANYTHING. A RECENT MRI SHOWED AN INTRACAPSULAR LEFT BREAST IMPLANT WITH NO EVIDENCE OF EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE. SUPEROLATERAL AND MEDIAL EXTRUSION WAS PRESENT. IT SHOWED AN INTACT RIGHT IMPLANT. A BILATERAL IMPLANT ULTRASOUND DEMONSTRATED ABUNDANT HOMOGENEOUS ECHOES IN THE RIGHT BREAST IMPLANT CONSISTENT WITH INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE. THE LEFT IMPLANT, BY COMPARISON, HAD SMOOTH MARGINS AND AN ANECHOIC INTERIOR CONSISTENT WITH INTEGRITY. THE INFO SHE RECEIVED SAID ARM AND SHOULDER PAIN MIGHT BE A SYMPTOM. ON 10/17/91 SHE WAS ADMITTED TO THE HOSP FOR SHOULDER SURGERY. IN JANUARY, SHE STARTED HAVING SEVERE SCALP ITCH. BUMPS CAME UP ON HER HEAD AND WOULD OOZE AND FORM CLEAR SCABS WHEN SHE SCRATCHED THEM. SHE WENT TO TWO DERMATOLOGISTS WITH NO RELIEF. SHE ALSO DEVELOPED A SEVERE BLADDER INFECTION. SHE WENT TO ONE DR WHO GAVE HER ANTIBIOTICS, AND SAID THAT IT SHOULD ALSO HELP THE RASH THAT HAD DEVELOPED IN PATCHES OVER HER BODY. SHE RECEIVED NO RELIEF. FINALLY, SHE WENT BACK TO HER FAMILY DR WHO PUT HER ON ANTIBIOTICS AND THE RASH BEGAN TO CLEAR. AFTER ABOUT 2 WEEKS, MOST OF THE RASH HAD DISAPPEARED EXCEPT ON HER HEAD. IT IS BETTER BUT STILL POPS UP. HER BLADDER SEEMS TO BE OK NOW. SHE HAS HAD SEVERE HAIR LOSS PROBABLY DUE TO INFECTED SCALP. SHE THINKS SHE SHOULD HAVE THESE IMPLANTS REMOVED AND NOT REPLACED.

SHE WAS HUGGING HER HUSBAND IN SPRING 1985 WHEN SHE FELT A POP AT HER LEFT BREAST. SHE ASSUMED IT WAS THE SCAR TISSUE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT THAT RELEASD BECAUSE SHE WAS TOLD THEY WOULD NOT RUPTURE FROM EVERYDAY SITUATIONS. THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN THE BREAST AND SHE SOON FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT. IT CAME TO HER ATTENTION YEARS LATER THAT IMPLANTS WERE RUPTURING AND SHE STARTED TO SUSPECT IT AS A CAUSE FOR HER FAILING HEALTH. IN THE SAME TIME FRAME AS THE ""POP"", SHE STARTED WITH SUDDEN UNEXPLAINED COMPLETE AND TOTAL NUMBNESS IN BOTH ARMS AND HANDS DURING THE NIGHT AND ""PINS AND NEEDLES"" DURING THE DAY. SHE ALSO STARTED TO GET STABBING PAINS IN THE AREA OF THE OUTER CORNER OF HER LEFT EYE. OVER TIME IT DEVELOPED INTO A ""HEADACHE THAT WAS CONSTANT, DAY AND NIGHT FOR EIGHT YEARS. FOR ALL THOSE YEARS SHE NEVER GOT A FULL NIGHTS SLEEP SO SHE DID NOT KNOW IF THE FATIGUE WAS ALSO A SYMPTOM OR A RESULT OF THE LACK OF SLEEP. THE TOTAL NUMBNESS OF HER ARMS AND HANDS HAS SUBSIDED BUT NOW SHE HAS MORE PINS AND NEEDLES, PAIN AND BURNING PAIN. THEY WILL GO COMPLETELY NUMB ON OCCASION, MOSTLY DURING SLEEP. THE DOCTORS SAID IT WAS BILATERAL CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME. SHE HAD NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES TO CONFIRM THE PROBLEM. SURGERY WAS PERFORMED ON HER RIGHT HAND BUT THERE BUT THERE HAS BEEN NO IMPROVEMENT. IN 4/24/93 SHE HAD TO HAVE HER OVARIES REMOVED BECAUSE OF A LARGE CYST. SHE REQUESTED THAT THE LAB SCREEN FOR SILICONE BECAUSE SHE WAS SO CERTAIN IT WAS THE CAUSE OF HER HEALTH PROBLEMS. THE LAB DID FIND  SILICONE IN THE CYST. SHE HAD HER IMPLANTS AND SCAR TISSUE REMOVED 5/27/92. THE LEFT IMPLANT HAD A LARGE RUPTURE. RECONSTRUCTION SURGERY WAS PERFORMED. A YEAR OR MORE AFTER EXPLANTATION HER ""HEADACHES"" FINALLY LET UP ENOUGH SO THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO SLEEP MOST NIGHTS. HER MAJOR PROBLEMS THESE DAYS ARE HER ARMS AND HANDS. THEY BURN AND HURT ALL THE TIME. HER JOINTS HAVE ACHED FOR A LONG TIME BUT THEY SEEM TO BE GETTING WORSE, ESPECIALLY HER FINGER JOINTS, ELBOWS, WRISTS AND LEFT SHOULDER.

IN 1975 I HAD DOW CORNING BREAST IMPLANTS PLACED IN MY BODY FOR COSMETIC REASONS. I WAS A HEALTHY 33 YEAR OLD WOMAN. AFTER BEING TOLD IMPLANTS WERE PERFECTLY SAFE AND THAT THEY WOULD LAST A LIFE TIME I WILLINGLY SIGNED UP FOR SURGERY. WITHIN THREE MONTHS I DEVELOPED HARD CAPSULES BILATERALLY. MY SURGEON ASSURED ME ALL WAS WELL, HOWEVER HE WOULD NEED TO PERFORM A CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY IN ORDER TO SOFTEN BOTH BREASTS. I RECALL BEING FEARFUL OF THIS PROCEDURE AS A) MY SURGEON MADE ME PROMISE ""NOT TO YELL"" AND B) THERE WOULD BE NO ANESTHESIA. PROCEDURE WAS INDEED VERY PAINFUL AS HE MANUALLY APPLIED PRESSURE TO EACH BREAST AND ""CRACKED"" THEM. I FELT A TEARING SENSATION AROUND EACH BREAST. THIS WAS FIRST OF NINE CLOSED CAPSULOTOMIES, AND I SUSPECT MY LEFT IMPLANT WAS RUPTURED FROM VERY FIRST ONE. ONE YEAR AFTER IMPLANTATION I BEGAN TO HAVE PAIN IN JOINTS OF MY RIGHT HAND AND A STRANGE RASH APPEARED ON MY CHEST AND ARMS. THREE YEARS LATER I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH THYROID CANCER. WHEN I COLLECTED ALL MY MEDICAL RECORDS OVER LAST FEW YEARS I FOUND MY BIOPSY WHICH REFERRED NOT ONLY TO MY MALIGNANT TUMOR, BUT ALSO TO ""YELLOW GELATINOUS MATERIAL"" SURROUNDING MY THYROID GLAND. EVEN THOUGH MY MEDICAL RECORDS CLEARLY STATED I HAD HAD A BREAST AUGMENTATION, NO ONE AT TIME OF SURGERY MENTIONED PRESENCE OF A FOREIGN BODY MATERIAL FOUND IN MY GLAND. MY TUMOR WAS REMOVED YET AN OBVIOUSLY RUPTURED IMPLANT WAS ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN MY BODY FOR SEVERAL MORE YEARS. IT IS KNOWN THAT MOST OF MEDICAL COMMUNITY REFUSES TO ADMIT ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS AND DISEASE; HOWEVER, GIVEN THE PRESENCE OF SILICA THOUGHOUT MY THYROID GLAND AND LYMPH NODES THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND AS TO WHAT CAUSED MY CANCER. SIX YEARS AFTER IMPLANTATION MY RASH CONTINUED TO SPREAD, MY JOINTS ACHED AND MY LEFT BREAST BECAME PAINFUL AND ""HOT"" FEELING. MY LEFT NIPPLE ALSO TURNED A DARKER COLOR THAN OTHER ONE. I FELT FATIGUED, AND DISORIENTATED MOST OF TIME. I CONTINUED TO SEEK MEDICAL CARE AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS NO EXPLANATION FOR MY BODY RASH. MY PHYSICIANS COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR MY SLOW RECOVERY FROM THYROID CANCER AND ALL RELATED TREATMENTS I ENDURED. DUE TO PAIN AND CONTINUED HARDENING OF MY LEFT BREAST MY SURGEON DECIDED TO REPLACE THIS IMPLANT WITH ANOTHER DOW CORNING UNIT. AFTER SURGERY HE DID NOT TELL ME THAT EXPLANTED IMPLANT WAS RUPTURED (I LEARNED ABOUT RUPTURE WHEN COLLECTING ALL MY DATA THREE YEARS AGO). TWELVE YEARS AFTER IMPLANTATION I BEGAN TO HAVE TREMORS IN MY LEFT HAND, CHRONIC GASTRITIS, JOINT ACHE AND A ""PINS AND NEEDLES"" SENSATION IN MY LEGS AND ARMS. AT TIMES I IMAGINED SPIDERS WERE CRAWLING ON MY LEGS. FROM THIS POINT MY HEALTH WENT INTO A DOWNWARD SPIRAL AND I BECAME MORE DEPRESSED AS EACH DOCTOR'S APPT SUGGESTED SAME METHOD OF TREATMENT... SEEK MENTAL THERAPY. BY 1994, AFTER 19 YEARS OF IMPLANTS, MY HEALTH HIT ROCK BOTTOM. I WAS FATIGUED BEYOND POINT OF RECOVERY, NERVOUS, DEPRESSED AND, YES, SUICIDAL. MY BODY WOULD REACT TO SLIGHTEST STIMULANT AND I WAS HAVING SEVERE MEMORY LOSS, AND I BECAME DYSLEXIC. AT ONE POINT I WENT TO OUR LOCAL MARKET, LESS THAN A MILE FROM HOME, AND I COULDN'T REMEMBER HOW TO DRIVE HOME. I BEGAN TO LOSE MY BALANCE AND I HAD DISTORTED VISION. EVEN TODAY ONE OF MY PUPILS DOES NOT DILATE NORMALLY. I RETURNED MANY TIMES TO TRY TO FIND A CURE FOR MY RACING HEARTBEAT, MY RASH, STIFFNESS AND PAIN IN MY LIMBS, TREMOR IN MY HAND, EYE AND VAGINAL DRYNESS. AGAIN I WAS TOLD TO SEEK COUNSELING. OVER THIS PERIOD MY MARRIAGE FAILED AND I BEGAN TO THINK I WAS REALLY CRAZY. I CONSIDERED TAKING MY LIFE MANY TIMES. BY 1994 I WAS FALLING INTO A DEEP HOLE. AFTER A NEAR HEAD ON COLLISION BECAUSE I WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY DISCERNING LEFT FROM RIGHT I BEGAN TO FEAR DRIVING. MY LIFE WAS OUT OF CONTROL. AS A RESULT OF ALL MEDIA COVERAGE AROUND 1994 ON BREAST IMPLANTS I RETURNED TO MY PLASTIC SURGEON. HE TOLD ME THERE COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN MY ""IMAGINED SYMPTOMS"" AND BREAST IMPLANTS. HE DID, HOWEVER, CONCEDE THAT MY IMPLANTS ""LOOKED TERRIBLE"" DUE TO EVER PRESENT CAPSULES. HE RELUCTANTLY AGREED TO REMOVE MY IMPLANTS ON MAY 4, 1994. OF COURSE IT WAS SUGGESTED I REPLACE THEM WITH SALINE IMPLANTS WHICH I DECLINED. ONE MONTH AFTER EXPLANTATION I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BRAIN LESIONS WHICH EXPLAINS MY DIAGNOSES OF ATYPICAL MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. FOR SIX MONTHS MY SYMPTOMS SEEM TO INTENSIFY AND THEN I BEGAN TO SLOWLY IMPROVE. TODAY I LIVE WITH DISCOMFORT AND PAIN OF STIFF LEGS AND SENSATION OF SPIDERS ON MY SKIN IS STILL WITH ME. CLIMATE EXTREMES MAKES PAIN IN MY LEGS UNBEARABLE. MY MEMORY HAS IMPROVED AND I NO LONGER SUFFER, OR CAUSE OTHERS TO SUFFER, THOSE HORRIBLE AND UNPREDICTABLE MOOD SWINGS. MY CANCER IS IN REMISSION AND I AM ON MEDICATION FOR REST OF MY LIFE. MY RASH, IT APPEARS, IS WITH ME FOR LIFE. EVEN THOUGH I'VE HAD SOME IMPROVEMENT MY HEALTH HAS BEEN PERMANENTLY DAMAGED BY BREAST IMPLANTS. WHAT HAS ALL THIS MEANT TO ME? I AM ANGRY TO HAVE LOST 19 YEARS OF MY LIFE TO AVARICE AND DECEPTION OF DOW CORNING. I MOURN LOSS OF MY FIRST MARRIAGE AND I CAN'T HELP WONDERING WHAT LONG TERM HEALTH RISKS ARE FOR ME AND MY FELLOW SURVIVORS. WOULD I HAVE CONSENTED TO BREAST IMPLANTS HAD I BEEN TOLD OF CONSEQUENCES OR GIVEN CONSIDERATION OF READING MANY NEGATIVE TEST RESULTS DOW CORNING HAD AVAILABLE AS EARLY AS 1975? ABSOLUTELY NOT! I WILL DO ALL THAT IS POSSIBLE TO DISCOURAGE YOUNGER WOMEN FROM PURSUING IMPLANTS BE THEY SALINE, SOY, OR WHATEVER ELSE SOME MISGUIDED SCIENTIST DREAMS UP. I STRUGGLE EACH DAY TO COME TO TERMS WITH WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME. THER'S A PART OF ME THAT WANTS TO DENY DECEPTION AND LIES OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES.

WOULD I HAVE CONSENTED TO BREAST IMPLANTS HAD I BEEN TOLD OF THE CONSEQUENCES OR GIVEN CONSIDERATION OF READING MANY NEGATIVE TEST RESULTS DOW CORNING HAD AVAILABLE AS EARLY AS 1975? ABSOLUTELY NOT! I WILL DO ALL THAT IS POSSIBLE TO DISCOURAGE YOUNGER WOMEN FROM PURSUING IMPLANTS BE THEY SALINE, SOY, OR WHATEVER ELSE SOME MISGUIDED SCIENTIST DREAMS UP. I STRUGGLE EACH DAY TO COME TO TERMS WITH WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME. THERE'S A PART OF ME THAT WANTS TO DENY THE DECEPTION AND LIES OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. IN OTHER WORDS I STILL WANT TO TRUST AND BELIEVE IN GOODNESS OF MAN. THIS I REALIZE IS A FALLACY. I STRONGLY URGE THAT ALL IMPLANTS BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET..."""|GEL-FILLED MAMMARY IMPLANT|350-7200|03/27/1995|Y|||Y||20620.0|*|FTR|1.0||BREAST IMPLANT|Y|229038|*||MIDLAND|US|DOW CORNING CORP.||MI|48686|0994|*|LEFT|True

THEY ALSO SUSPECT A LEAK IN THE RIGHT IN THAT THEY FEEL THEY ARE SMALLER ON THE SIDE. THEY ARE NOW TAKEN TO THE OPERATING ROOM FOR SUBSEQUENT REPLACEMENT OF BILATERAL IMPLANTS. PROCEDURE: AFTER ADMINISTRATION OF GENERAL ENDOTRACHEAL ANESTHESIA, THE PT WAS PREPPED AND DRAPED IN A STERILE FASHION. SUBSEQUENTLY A #15 BLADE WAS UTILIZED TO EXCISE THE PREVIOUS INFRAMAMMARY SCAR. BOVIE CAUTERIZATION WAS UTILIZED TO DISSECT THROUGH THE UNDERLYING BREAST IMPLANT CAPSULE. HERE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE BREAST IMPLANT WAS TOTALLY FLAT AND WAS REMOVED FROM ITS POCKET. THE CAPSULE WAS EXAMINED AND FOUND TO STILL TO RETAIN MOST OF ITS BASE. PT WAS NOTED TO HAVE AN INFRAMAMMARY CREASE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER BY AT LEAST 2CM ON THE LEFT AS COMPARED TO THE RIGHT. AN INFERIOR CAPSULOTOMY WAS PERFORMED AFTER REFLECTION OF THE BREAST CAPSULE EXTENDING FROM APPROX THE THREE O'CLOCK POSITION OF THE LATERAL CAPSULE TO THE NINE O'CLOCK POSITION OF THE MEDIAL CAPSULE. HEMOSTASIS WAS ACHIEVED WITH BOVIE CAUTERIZATION. AFTER COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF NORMAL SALINE WAS UTILIZED TO IRRIGATE THE POCKET, A 350CC IMPLANT WAS BROUGHT INTO THE FIELD, EVACUATED OF ALL AIR AND FILLED WITH 120CC OF SALINE. SUBSEQUENTLY THIS WAS THEN PLACED INTO THE POCKET AND THEN OVERFILLED TO MFR'S SPECIFICATIONS OF 400CC. AFTER REMOVING THE ANTERIOR FILL APPARATUS AND REPLACING THE PLUG, THE IMPLANT WAS APPROPRIATELY POSITIONED IN THE CAPSULE. PREPLACED 3-0 VICRYL SUTURES WERE THEN TIED DOWN THROUGH THE CAPSULAR PORTION OF THE ORIGINAL INCISION AND BURIED INTERRUPTED 4-0 PDS SUTURE WAS UTILIZED FOR COAPTATION OF DERMAL SKIN EDGES. ATTENTION WAS THEN TURNED TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE WHERE AGAIN THE PREVIOUS SCAR WAS EXCISED AND THEN BOVIE CAUTERIZATION UTILIZED TO DIVIDE DOWN AND THROUGH THE UNDERLYING IMPLANT CAPSULE. HERE THEN THE IMPLANT WAS REMOVED FROM ITS POCKET. IT APPEARED TO BE INTACT AS BEST COULD BE DETERMINED. BOTH IMPLANTS WERE APPROPRIATELY PACKAGED TO BE RETURNED TO MENTOR. AFTER EXAMINING THE CAPSULE, COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF NORMAL SALINE WAS UTILIZED TO IRRIGATE THE POCKET. A SECOND 350CC IMPLANT WAS BROUGHT TO THE FIELD, SUBSEQUENTLY FILLED WITH 120CC SALINE AND EVACUATED OF ALL AIR. AFTER PREPLACING AGAIN 3-0 VICRYL THROUGH THE INFERIOR CAPSULAR INCISION, THE IMPLANT WAS THEN PLACED INTO THE POCKET AND OVERFILLED TO MFR'S SPECIFICATIONS OF 400CC SALINE SOLUTION. THE ANTERIOR FILL APPARATUS WAS REMOVED AND THE PLUG REPLACED. AFTER POSITIONING THE IMPLANT, IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE CAPSULE EXTENDED MUCH FARTHER LATERALLY I.E. TO THE MID-AXILLARY LINE AS COMPARED TO THE RIGHT SIDE WHICH EXTENDED ONLY TO THE ______-AXILLARY LINE. SUBSEQUENTLY THIS ALSO CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT ABNORMAL CONCAVITY AS THE IMPLANT PULLED AWAY FROM ITS MEDIAL CAPSULE REFLECTION CAUSING A TELLTALE CONCAVITY IN THIS AREA. THE IMPLANT SUBSEQUENTLY WAS REMOVED FROM THE POCKET AND A CAPSULOPLASTY PERFORMED LATERALLY BY UTILIZING A SPINAL NEEDLE AS WELL AS BRILLIANT GREEN TO MARK THE APPROX NEW REFLECTIONS SYMMETRIC WITH THE OPPOSITE SIDE THROUGH THE ENTIRE BREAST AFTER THIS WAS MARKED APPROPRIATELY. A CAPSULOTOMY THEN WAS PERFORMED LATERALLY ACROSS THIS PRE-MARKED AREA ALONG THE LATERAL ASPECT OF THE CAPSULE DOME AS WELL AS ALONG THE CHEST WALL. THE CAPSULOPLASTY WAS THEN PERFORMED WITH RUNNING 2-0 VICRYL SUTURE, SUTURING THE MOST MEDIAL EDGES OF THE CAPSULOTOMIES TOGETHER. AFTER THIS WAS SECURELY IN PLACE, THE IMPLANT WAS BROUGHT INTO THE FIELD AND PLACED BACK INTO THE POCKET WHERE THEN IT APPEARED TO BE MUCH MORE SYMMETRIC WITH THE OPPOSITE SIDE IN TERMS OF ITS POSITION. AGAIN THE PREPLACED 3-0 VICRYL SUTURES WERE THEN TIED DOWN ALONG THE INFERIOR CAPSULAR INCISION. INVERTED INTERRUPTED 4-0 PDS SUTURE WAS UTILIZED FOR COAPTATION OF DERMAL SKIN EDGES. AFTER TREATING THIS SKIN WITH USE OF BENZOIN, 1/2"" STERI-STRIPS WERE APPLIED LONGITUDINALLY FOR COAPTATION OF EPIDERMIS. A CIRCUMTHORACIC DRESSING WAS APPLIED CONSISTING OF MULTIPLE FLUFFS ANTERIORLY ABOUT BOTH BREASTS, SECURED WITH THE USE OF A PIZZA BOARD WITH TWO WRAPS OF KERLIX ROLL AS WELL AS TWO 6"" ACE WRAPS SECURED ANTERIORLY WITH 2"" WIDE SILK TAPE. THE PT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY EXTUBATED AND TAKEN TO THE RECOVERY ROOM. FINAL SPONGE AND NEEDLE COUNTS WERE CORRECT. TOTAL TIME OF OPERATION WAS APPROX ONE HOUR AND TEN MINUTES. THE TOTAL BLOOD LOSS WAS APPROX 25CC. THE PT WAS IN THE OPERATING ROOM FOR LESS THAN ONE AND ONE-HALF HOURS."|UNK|UNK|09/08/2000|V||UNKNOWN|Y||285491.0||FWM|1.0||SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS|Y|UNK|UNK||UNK|*|UNK|||||UNK|UNK|True

A MODERATELY-LARGE LEFT PERI-PROSTHETIC EFFUSION SEEN BY MRI IN 2012 CONTAINED NON-ATYPICAL LYMPHOCYTES AND MACROPHAGES IN A PROTEINACEOUS BACKGROUND, AND WAS CYTOLOGICALLY INTERPRETED AS A SEROMA. SHE HAD TWO OTHER SEROMAS OF HER RIGHT BREAST (2013) THAT SPONTANEOUSLY REGRESSED WITHOUT EVACUATION. ON (B)(6) 2015, SHE COMPLAINED OF PAIN AND SWELLING OF HER RIGHT BREAST. A LARGE PERI-IMPLANT EFFUSION SUSPICIOUS OF AN INFLAMMATORY PROCESS BY ULTRASOUND WAS COMPLETELY DRAINED BY FNA, RECOVERING 85 CC OF CLOUDY YELLOW FLUID. BILATERAL IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED. SHE IS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING A WAIT-AND-SEE STRATEGY AND IS ALIVE WITHOUT DISEASE 8 MONTHS AFTER HER LYMPHOMA DIAGNOSIS. TITLE: ""THE CASE AGAINST BIOFILM AS THE PRIMARY INITIATOR OF BREAST IMPLANT-ASSOCIATED ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA."" THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO PRESENT THE FIRST PUBLISHED REPORT OF A BILATERAL ALK-NEGATIVE ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA DIAGNOSED BY CYTOLOGY.
