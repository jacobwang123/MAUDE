THE NERVES WERE DAMAGED SO BADLY THAT SHE STILL HAS HOT TINGLING SENSATIONS AND PAIN REGULARLY. AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH RAYNAUD'S PHENOMENON. SHE TOLD HER DR WHEN HER HANDS GOT COLD THEY TURNED BLUE, THEN BLACK BEFORE ALL THE BLOOD DRAINED FROM THEM AND THEY TURNED TRANSPARENT. SHE SAYS THEY CAN BE VERY PAINFUL. HANDLING ANYTHING COLD OR EVEN DRINKING SOMETHING COLD CAN BRING ON THE PROBLEM. HER FEET ARE THE SAME. HER TOES AND TOENAILS ARE SORE AROUND THE EDGES. ALSO HER HANDS OFTEN GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT WAKING HER UP. SHE ALSO DEVELOPED ARTHRITIS SYMPTOMS. SHE BEGAN TO SUSPECT A PROBLEM WHEN SHE HAD A COLD THAT LASTED APPROX 2 YRS. ANTIBIOTICS DIDN'T SEEM TO HELP HER MUCH. HER DR SENT HER FOR MAMMOGRAMS AND X-RAYS BUT DID NOT FIND ANYTHING. A RECENT MRI SHOWED AN INTRACAPSULAR LEFT BREAST IMPLANT WITH NO EVIDENCE OF EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE. SUPEROLATERAL AND MEDIAL EXTRUSION WAS PRESENT. IT SHOWED AN INTACT RIGHT IMPLANT. A BILATERAL IMPLANT ULTRASOUND DEMONSTRATED ABUNDANT HOMOGENEOUS ECHOES IN THE RIGHT BREAST IMPLANT CONSISTENT WITH INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE. THE LEFT IMPLANT, BY COMPARISON, HAD SMOOTH MARGINS AND AN ANECHOIC INTERIOR CONSISTENT WITH INTEGRITY. THE INFO SHE RECEIVED SAID ARM AND SHOULDER PAIN MIGHT BE A SYMPTOM. ON 10/17/91 SHE WAS ADMITTED TO THE HOSP FOR SHOULDER SURGERY. IN JANUARY, SHE STARTED HAVING SEVERE SCALP ITCH. BUMPS CAME UP ON HER HEAD AND WOULD OOZE AND FORM CLEAR SCABS WHEN SHE SCRATCHED THEM. SHE WENT TO TWO DERMATOLOGISTS WITH NO RELIEF. SHE ALSO DEVELOPED A SEVERE BLADDER INFECTION. SHE WENT TO ONE DR WHO GAVE HER ANTIBIOTICS, AND SAID THAT IT SHOULD ALSO HELP THE RASH THAT HAD DEVELOPED IN PATCHES OVER HER BODY. SHE RECEIVED NO RELIEF. FINALLY, SHE WENT BACK TO HER FAMILY DR WHO PUT HER ON ANTIBIOTICS AND THE RASH BEGAN TO CLEAR. AFTER ABOUT 2 WEEKS, MOST OF THE RASH HAD DISAPPEARED EXCEPT ON HER HEAD. IT IS BETTER BUT STILL POPS UP. HER BLADDER SEEMS TO BE OK NOW. SHE HAS HAD SEVERE HAIR LOSS PROBABLY DUE TO INFECTED SCALP. SHE THINKS SHE SHOULD HAVE THESE IMPLANTS REMOVED AND NOT REPLACED.

SHE ASSUMED IT WAS THE SCAR TISSUE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT THAT RELEASD BECAUSE SHE WAS TOLD THEY WOULD NOT RUPTURE FROM EVERYDAY SITUATIONS. THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN THE BREAST AND SHE SOON FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT. IT CAME TO HER ATTENTION YEARS LATER THAT IMPLANTS WERE RUPTURING AND SHE STARTED TO SUSPECT IT AS A CAUSE FOR HER FAILING HEALTH.

SHE ALSO STARTED TO GET STABBING PAINS IN THE AREA OF THE OUTER CORNER OF HER LEFT EYE. OVER TIME IT DEVELOPED INTO A ""HEADACHE THAT WAS CONSTANT, DAY AND NIGHT FOR EIGHT YEARS.

THE TOTAL NUMBNESS OF HER ARMS AND HANDS HAS SUBSIDED BUT NOW SHE HAS MORE PINS AND NEEDLES, PAIN AND BURNING PAIN. THEY WILL GO COMPLETELY NUMB ON OCCASION, MOSTLY DURING SLEEP.

IN 1975 I HAD DOW CORNING BREAST IMPLANTS PLACED IN MY BODY FOR COSMETIC REASONS. I WAS A HEALTHY 33 YEAR OLD WOMAN. AFTER BEING TOLD IMPLANTS WERE PERFECTLY SAFE AND THAT THEY WOULD LAST A LIFE TIME I WILLINGLY SIGNED UP FOR SURGERY. WITHIN THREE MONTHS I DEVELOPED HARD CAPSULES BILATERALLY. MY SURGEON ASSURED ME ALL WAS WELL, HOWEVER HE WOULD NEED TO PERFORM A CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY IN ORDER TO SOFTEN BOTH BREASTS. I RECALL BEING FEARFUL OF THIS PROCEDURE AS A) MY SURGEON MADE ME PROMISE ""NOT TO YELL"" AND B) THERE WOULD BE NO ANESTHESIA. PROCEDURE WAS INDEED VERY PAINFUL AS HE MANUALLY APPLIED PRESSURE TO EACH BREAST AND ""CRACKED"" THEM. I FELT A TEARING SENSATION AROUND EACH BREAST. THIS WAS FIRST OF NINE CLOSED CAPSULOTOMIES, AND I SUSPECT MY LEFT IMPLANT WAS RUPTURED FROM VERY FIRST ONE. ONE YEAR AFTER IMPLANTATION I BEGAN TO HAVE PAIN IN JOINTS OF MY RIGHT HAND AND A STRANGE RASH APPEARED ON MY CHEST AND ARMS. THREE YEARS LATER I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH THYROID CANCER. WHEN I COLLECTED ALL MY MEDICAL RECORDS OVER LAST FEW YEARS I FOUND MY BIOPSY WHICH REFERRED NOT ONLY TO MY MALIGNANT TUMOR, BUT ALSO TO ""YELLOW GELATINOUS MATERIAL"" SURROUNDING MY THYROID GLAND. EVEN THOUGH MY MEDICAL RECORDS CLEARLY STATED I HAD HAD A BREAST AUGMENTATION, NO ONE AT TIME OF SURGERY MENTIONED PRESENCE OF A FOREIGN BODY MATERIAL FOUND IN MY GLAND. MY TUMOR WAS REMOVED YET AN OBVIOUSLY RUPTURED IMPLANT WAS ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN MY BODY FOR SEVERAL MORE YEARS. IT IS KNOWN THAT MOST OF MEDICAL COMMUNITY REFUSES TO ADMIT ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS AND DISEASE; HOWEVER, GIVEN THE PRESENCE OF SILICA THOUGHOUT MY THYROID GLAND AND LYMPH NODES THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND AS TO WHAT CAUSED MY CANCER. SIX YEARS AFTER IMPLANTATION MY RASH CONTINUED TO SPREAD, MY JOINTS ACHED AND MY LEFT BREAST BECAME PAINFUL AND ""HOT"" FEELING. MY LEFT NIPPLE ALSO TURNED A DARKER COLOR THAN OTHER ONE. I FELT FATIGUED, AND DISORIENTATED MOST OF TIME. I CONTINUED TO SEEK MEDICAL CARE AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS NO EXPLANATION FOR MY BODY RASH. MY PHYSICIANS COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR MY SLOW RECOVERY FROM THYROID CANCER AND ALL RELATED TREATMENTS I ENDURED. DUE TO PAIN AND CONTINUED HARDENING OF MY LEFT BREAST MY SURGEON DECIDED TO REPLACE THIS IMPLANT WITH ANOTHER DOW CORNING UNIT. AFTER SURGERY HE DID NOT TELL ME THAT EXPLANTED IMPLANT WAS RUPTURED (I LEARNED ABOUT RUPTURE WHEN COLLECTING ALL MY DATA THREE YEARS AGO). TWELVE YEARS AFTER IMPLANTATION I BEGAN TO HAVE TREMORS IN MY LEFT HAND, CHRONIC GASTRITIS, JOINT ACHE AND A ""PINS AND NEEDLES"" SENSATION IN MY LEGS AND ARMS. AT TIMES I IMAGINED SPIDERS WERE CRAWLING ON MY LEGS. FROM THIS POINT MY HEALTH WENT INTO A DOWNWARD SPIRAL AND I BECAME MORE DEPRESSED AS EACH DOCTOR'S APPT SUGGESTED SAME METHOD OF TREATMENT... SEEK MENTAL THERAPY. BY 1994, AFTER 19 YEARS OF IMPLANTS, MY HEALTH HIT ROCK BOTTOM. I WAS FATIGUED BEYOND POINT OF RECOVERY, NERVOUS, DEPRESSED AND, YES, SUICIDAL. MY BODY WOULD REACT TO SLIGHTEST STIMULANT AND I WAS HAVING SEVERE MEMORY LOSS, AND I BECAME DYSLEXIC. AT ONE POINT I WENT TO OUR LOCAL MARKET, LESS THAN A MILE FROM HOME, AND I COULDN'T REMEMBER HOW TO DRIVE HOME. I BEGAN TO LOSE MY BALANCE AND I HAD DISTORTED VISION.

I RETURNED MANY TIMES TO TRY TO FIND A CURE FOR MY RACING HEARTBEAT, MY RASH, STIFFNESS AND PAIN IN MY LIMBS, TREMOR IN MY HAND, EYE AND VAGINAL DRYNESS. AGAIN I WAS TOLD TO SEEK COUNSELING.

AFTER A NEAR HEAD ON COLLISION BECAUSE I WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY DISCERNING LEFT FROM RIGHT I BEGAN TO FEAR DRIVING. MY LIFE WAS OUT OF CONTROL. AS A RESULT OF ALL MEDIA COVERAGE AROUND 1994 ON BREAST IMPLANTS I RETURNED TO MY PLASTIC SURGEON. HE TOLD ME THERE COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN MY ""IMAGINED SYMPTOMS"" AND BREAST IMPLANTS. HE DID, HOWEVER, CONCEDE THAT MY IMPLANTS ""LOOKED TERRIBLE"" DUE TO EVER PRESENT CAPSULES. HE RELUCTANTLY AGREED TO REMOVE MY IMPLANTS ON MAY 4, 1994. OF COURSE IT WAS SUGGESTED I REPLACE THEM WITH SALINE IMPLANTS WHICH I DECLINED. ONE MONTH AFTER EXPLANTATION I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BRAIN LESIONS WHICH EXPLAINS MY DIAGNOSES OF ATYPICAL MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS.

IN 1975 I HAD DOW CORNING BREAST IMPLANTS PLACED IN MY BODY FOR COSMETIC REASONS. I WAS A HEALTHY 33 YEAR OLD WOMAN. AFTER BEING TOLD IMPLANTS WERE PERFECTLY SAFE AND THAT THEY WOULD LAST A LIFE TIME I WILLINGLY SIGNED UP FOR SURGERY. WITHIN THREE MONTHS I DEVELOPED HARD CAPSULES BILATERALLY. MY SURGEON ASSURED ME ALL WAS WELL, HOWEVER HE WOULD NEED TO PERFORM A CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY IN ORDER TO SOFTEN BOTH BREASTS. I RECALL BEING FEARFUL OF THIS PROCEDURE AS A) MY SURGEON MADE ME PROMISE ""NOT TO YELL"" AND B) THERE WOULD BE NO ANESTHESIA. PROCEDURE WAS INDEED VERY PAINFUL AS HE MANUALLY APPLIED PRESURE TO EACH BREAST AND ""CRACKED"" THEM. I FELT A TEARING SENSATION AROUND EACH BREAST. THIS WAS THE FIRST OF NINE CLOSED CAPSULOTOMIES, AND I SUSPECT MY LEFT IMPLANT WAS RUPTURED FROM THE VERY FIRST ONE. ONE YEAR AFTER IMPLANTATION I BEGAN TO HAVE PAIN IN JOINTS OF MY RIGHT HAND AND A STRANGE RASH APPEARED ON MY CHEST AND ARMS. THREE YEARS LATER I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH THYROID CANCER.

SINCE SHE ONLY LEARNED IN 1993 THAT SHE HAD A SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT THAT RUPTURED IN 1979, HER MAJOR CONCERN IS A CORRECT MEDICAL EVALUATION WITH THE PROPER TREATMENT FOR (1) A LUMP ON HER SPLEEN, (2) A VASCULAR LESION IN HER BACK FROM T-3 TO L-1 AND (3) INCREASED PAIN IN LEFT SIDE UNDER RIB CAGE AND BREAST AREA WITH A LUMP ON HER BREAST.

PER FOLLOW-UP RECEIVED ON 12/8/94: RPTR BECAME VERY ILL SUDDENLY AND WENT TO SEE A RHEUMATOLOGIST. SHE WAS VERY TIRED AND ALL HER MUSCLES WERE ACHING.

294958|148139|D|1||"PT UNDERWENT BILATERAL AUGMENTATION MAMMOPLASTY SEVERAL YEARS AGO. APPROX THREE WEEKS AGO THEY NOTICED THAT THE LEFT BREAST HAD BECOME SIGNIFICANTLY FLAT COMPARED TO THE RIGHT. THEY ALSO SUSPECT A LEAK IN THE RIGHT IN THAT THEY FEEL THEY ARE SMALLER ON THE SIDE. THEY ARE NOW TAKEN TO THE OPERATING ROOM FOR SUBSEQUENT REPLACEMENT OF BILATERAL IMPLANTS. PROCEDURE: AFTER ADMINISTRATION OF GENERAL ENDOTRACHEAL ANESTHESIA, THE PT WAS PREPPED AND DRAPED IN A STERILE FASHION. SUBSEQUENTLY A #15 BLADE WAS UTILIZED TO EXCISE THE PREVIOUS INFRAMAMMARY SCAR. BOVIE CAUTERIZATION WAS UTILIZED TO DISSECT THROUGH THE UNDERLYING BREAST IMPLANT CAPSULE. HERE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE BREAST IMPLANT WAS TOTALLY FLAT AND WAS REMOVED FROM ITS POCKET. THE CAPSULE WAS EXAMINED AND FOUND TO STILL TO RETAIN MOST OF ITS BASE. PT WAS NOTED TO HAVE AN INFRAMAMMARY CREASE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER BY AT LEAST 2CM ON THE LEFT AS COMPARED TO THE RIGHT. AN INFERIOR CAPSULOTOMY WAS PERFORMED AFTER REFLECTION OF THE BREAST CAPSULE EXTENDING FROM APPROX THE THREE O'CLOCK POSITION OF THE LATERAL CAPSULE TO THE NINE O'CLOCK POSITION OF THE MEDIAL CAPSULE. HEMOSTASIS WAS ACHIEVED WITH BOVIE CAUTERIZATION. AFTER COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF NORMAL SALINE WAS UTILIZED TO IRRIGATE THE POCKET, A 350CC IMPLANT WAS BROUGHT INTO THE FIELD, EVACUATED OF ALL AIR AND FILLED WITH 120CC OF SALINE. SUBSEQUENTLY THIS WAS THEN PLACED INTO THE POCKET AND THEN OVERFILLED TO MFR'S SPECIFICATIONS OF 400CC. AFTER REMOVING THE ANTERIOR FILL APPARATUS AND REPLACING THE PLUG, THE IMPLANT WAS APPROPRIATELY POSITIONED IN THE CAPSULE. PREPLACED 3-0 VICRYL SUTURES WERE THEN TIED DOWN THROUGH THE CAPSULAR PORTION OF THE ORIGINAL INCISION AND BURIED INTERRUPTED 4-0 PDS SUTURE WAS UTILIZED FOR COAPTATION OF DERMAL SKIN EDGES. ATTENTION WAS THEN TURNED TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE WHERE AGAIN THE PREVIOUS SCAR WAS EXCISED AND THEN BOVIE CAUTERIZATION UTILIZED TO DIVIDE DOWN AND THROUGH THE UNDERLYING IMPLANT CAPSULE. HERE THEN THE IMPLANT WAS REMOVED FROM ITS POCKET. IT APPEARED TO BE INTACT AS BEST COULD BE DETERMINED. BOTH IMPLANTS WERE APPROPRIATELY PACKAGED TO BE RETURNED TO MENTOR. AFTER EXAMINING THE CAPSULE, COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF NORMAL SALINE WAS UTILIZED TO IRRIGATE THE POCKET. A SECOND 350CC IMPLANT WAS BROUGHT TO THE FIELD, SUBSEQUENTLY FILLED WITH 120CC SALINE AND EVACUATED OF ALL AIR. AFTER PREPLACING AGAIN 3-0 VICRYL THROUGH THE INFERIOR CAPSULAR INCISION, THE IMPLANT WAS THEN PLACED INTO THE POCKET AND OVERFILLED TO MFR'S SPECIFICATIONS OF 400CC SALINE SOLUTION. THE ANTERIOR FILL APPARATUS WAS REMOVED AND THE PLUG REPLACED. AFTER POSITIONING THE IMPLANT, IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE CAPSULE EXTENDED MUCH FARTHER LATERALLY I.E. TO THE MID-AXILLARY LINE AS COMPARED TO THE RIGHT SIDE WHICH EXTENDED ONLY TO THE ______-AXILLARY LINE. SUBSEQUENTLY THIS ALSO CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT ABNORMAL CONCAVITY AS THE IMPLANT PULLED AWAY FROM ITS MEDIAL CAPSULE REFLECTION CAUSING A TELLTALE CONCAVITY IN THIS AREA. THE IMPLANT SUBSEQUENTLY WAS REMOVED FROM THE POCKET AND A CAPSULOPLASTY PERFORMED LATERALLY BY UTILIZING A SPINAL NEEDLE AS WELL AS BRILLIANT GREEN TO MARK THE APPROX NEW REFLECTIONS SYMMETRIC WITH THE OPPOSITE SIDE THROUGH THE ENTIRE BREAST AFTER THIS WAS MARKED APPROPRIATELY. A CAPSULOTOMY THEN WAS PERFORMED LATERALLY ACROSS THIS PRE-MARKED AREA ALONG THE LATERAL ASPECT OF THE CAPSULE DOME AS WELL AS ALONG THE CHEST WALL. THE CAPSULOPLASTY WAS THEN PERFORMED WITH RUNNING 2-0 VICRYL SUTURE, SUTURING THE MOST MEDIAL EDGES OF THE CAPSULOTOMIES TOGETHER. AFTER THIS WAS SECURELY IN PLACE, THE IMPLANT WAS BROUGHT INTO THE FIELD AND PLACED BACK INTO THE POCKET WHERE THEN IT APPEARED TO BE MUCH MORE SYMMETRIC WITH THE OPPOSITE SIDE IN TERMS OF ITS POSITION. AGAIN THE PREPLACED 3-0 VICRYL SUTURES WERE THEN TIED DOWN ALONG THE INFERIOR CAPSULAR INCISION. INVERTED INTERRUPTED 4-0 PDS SUTURE WAS UTILIZED FOR COAPTATION OF DERMAL SKIN EDGES. AFTER TREATING THIS SKIN WITH USE OF BENZOIN, 1/2"" STERI-STRIPS WERE APPLIED LONGITUDINALLY FOR COAPTATION OF EPIDERMIS. A CIRCUMTHORACIC DRESSING WAS APPLIED CONSISTING OF MULTIPLE FLUFFS ANTERIORLY ABOUT BOTH BREASTS, SECURED WITH THE USE OF A PIZZA BOARD WITH TWO WRAPS OF KERLIX ROLL AS WELL AS TWO 6"" ACE WRAPS SECURED ANTERIORLY WITH 2"" WIDE SILK TAPE. THE PT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY EXTUBATED AND TAKEN TO THE RECOVERY ROOM. FINAL SPONGE AND NEEDLE COUNTS WERE CORRECT. TOTAL TIME OF OPERATION WAS APPROX ONE HOUR AND TEN MINUTES. THE TOTAL BLOOD LOSS WAS APPROX 25CC.

PT DEVELOPED CAPSULAR CONTRACTURES FROM THE 1986 MAMMARY PROSTHESES AND HAD TO UNDERGO A REVISION BY SAME PHYSICIAN IN 1997. IMPLANTS REMAIN IN SUBGLANDULAR POCKETS AND OVER SEVERAL YEARS BECAME ENCAPSULATED. PT DEVELOPED MEDICAL PROBLEMS AND SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS. SIXTEEN YEARS LATER BILATERAL TOTAL ABLATIVE CAPSULECTOMIES WERE PERFORMED TO REMOVE IMPLANTS WHICH WERE GROSSLY RUPTURED. CAPSULES HAD HARDENED AND CALCIFIED RESULTING IN THINNING OF OVERLYING BREAST TISSUE. BREAST RECONSTRUCTION SECONDARY TO PROBLEMS WITH SILICONE IMPLANTS WAS DONE. THE REMOVED IMPLANTS WERE IDENTIFIED BY DIRECT INSPECTION BY THE PATHOLOGIST AS HAVING EMBOSSED CONCENTRIC RINGS. SUSPECT MEDICAL DEVICE INFO WAS INCORRECTLY STATED AS MENTOR. IMPLANTS HAVE ATTRIBUTES OF AMERICAN HEYER-SCHULTE IMPLANTS AND NOT MENTOR. THE ISSUE ARISES REGARDING THE AUTHENTICITY OF PRODUCT IDENTIFICATION LABELS PROVIDED AS PART OF PT'S RECORDS.

1022054|809237|D|1||"I HAD SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS INSERTED ABOUT 3 YEARS AGO. I WAS EXAMINED REGULARLY OVER THE 3 YEARS BECAUSE I WAS PART OF A SILICONE IMPLANT STUDY PRIOR TO THE FDA'S OFFICIAL APPROVAL OF SILICONE IMPLANTS FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC. RECENTLY, I DECIDED TO HAVE THEM REMOVED DUE TO SOME DISCOMFORT AND DISSATISFACTION WITH THE RESULTS OF THE SURGERY. I SAW A NUMBER OF SURGEONS TO DISCUSS REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANTS AND WAS EXAMINED BY A NUMBER OF DOCTORS, NONE OF WHICH MADE A RECOMMENDATION THAT I GET AN MRI. NONE OF THEM EVEN SUSPECTED A RUPTURE. I CHOSE A SURGEON WHO AGREED TO REMOVE THE IMPLANTS WITHOUT REPLACING THEM. I WAS TOLD IT WOULD BE A FAIRLY STRAIGHT FORWARD PROCEDURE. DURING SURGERY, HE DISCOVERED THAT ONE OF MY IMPLANTS HAD RUPTURED AND IT APPEARED AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN RUPTURED FOR A WHILE. DUE TO THE RUPTURE, THE SURGERY BECAME MORE COMPLICATED AS HE HAD TO SPEND A LOT MORE TIME CLEANING UP THE MESS CREATED BY THE RUPTURED SILICONE IMPLANT IN MY LEFT BREAST. IN THE PROCESS OF REMOVING THE SCATTERED SILICONE MORE BREAST TISSUE THAN ORIGINALLY EXPECTED WAS REMOVED DURING THE ""CLEAN UP"". FOLLOWING THE SURGERY I AM LEFT WITH A BREAST WHICH IS TAKING A LOT LONGER TO HEAL, I HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS WITH LEFT BREAST FOLLOWING THE SURGERY INCLUDING A LOT OF FLUID BUILD UP AND MULTIPLE DRAINS INSERTED TO HELP WITH THE FLUID DRAINAGE AND HEALING AND I'M STILL EXPERIENCING PAIN. I AM ALSO LEFT WITH UNEVEN BREASTS DUE TO THE COMPLICATION OF THE RUPTURED IMPLANT, AND THE ADD'L BREAST TISSUE REMOVED FROM THE BREAST WITH THE RUPTURED IMPLANT. NOW MY REASONS FOR REPORTING THIS ARE: BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT ALLERGAN PRODUCED A FAULTY IMPLANT WHICH LEFT ME IN THIS PREDICAMENT AS THERE IS NO OTHER INCIDENT -TRAUMATIC OR OTHERWISE- THAT COULD HAVE POSSIBLY CAUSED THIS RUPTURE AND THEY ARE NOT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY, IN FACT THEY ARE NOT EVEN HOLDING UP THEIR END OF THE WARRANTY BECAUSE I DISCOVERED THE RUPTURE DURING SURGERY AND NOT BEFORE WHICH LEADS ME TO THE SECOND REASON FOR REPORTING THIS: THERE IS NO WAY TO DETECT A RUPTURE IN A SILICONE IMPLANT EARLY ON BEFORE THE DAMAGE IS SEVERE. ACCORDING TO ALLERGAN, THEY RECOMMEND GETTING MRIS AFTER A CERTAIN NUMBER OF YEARS OR WHEN SUGGESTED BY A PHYSICIAN. I WAS EXAMINED MORE THAN MOST SILICONE IMPLANT PTS WOULD TYPICALLY BE, SINCE I WAS PART OF A STUDY WHICH REQUIRED CLOSE EXAMINATION AND REGULAR FOLLOW-UPS, AND I WAS NEVER TOLD TO GET AN MRI AND I WAS NEVER GIVEN ANY INDICATION THAT THE IMPLANT COULD HAVE RUPTURED EVEN WHEN I WAS EXPERIENCING SOME DISCOMFORT. CURRENTLY, ALLERGAN HAS THE IMPLANTS AND ARE INVESTIGATING THE CAUSE OF THE RUPTURE AND I'M STILL WAITING TO HEAR BACK FROM THEM. I DO NOT THINK THAT ALLERGAN HAS PUT THE APPROPRIATE MEASURES IN PLACE TO HELP PTS IDENTIFY RUPTURES EARLY ON TO AVOID LONG TERM PROBLEMS, SUCH AS PERMANENT DISFIGURATION AS I'VE EXPERIENCED. AND THEY CERTAINLY ARE NOT FOLLOWING APPROPRIATE BUSINESS PRACTICES TO RESOLVE ISSUES WHEN THEY OCCUR. IT IS COMPLETELY UNFAIR AND UNETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICE TO REFUSE TO PAY OUT THE SURGICAL COSTS OF THE IMPLANT REMOVAL BASED ON WHAT THEY SEE AS A ""LOOP HOLE"" WHEN THEIR WARRANTY SAYS THAT SURGICAL AND IMPLANT REPLACEMENT COSTS WILL BE PAID IF AN IMPLANT IS FAULTY. I DO NOT WANT THEM REPLACED AFTER THE TRAUMA I HAVE EXPERIENCED WITH THE FIRST IMPLANTS BUT I DO WANT THE SURGICAL COSTS FOR REMOVING THE IMPLANTS TO BE PAID FOR BY ALLERGAN AS THIS IS WHAT THEIR WARRANTY IS FOR. I'M SURE THEY DO THIS TO MOST PTS IN THE SAME SITUATION BECAUSE OF ALL THE PEOPLE I KNOW WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS, NONE ARE TOLD TO GET MRIS, SO I DON'T SEE HOW ANYONE IS GOING TO BE AWARE OF A RUPTURE UNTIL IT IS TOO LATE AND THE EFFECTS ARE IRREVERSIBLE. I CONSIDER MYSELF LUCKY TO HAVE DETECTED THE RUPTURE NOW, HAD I NOT TAKEN ANY ACTION TO HAVE THEM REMOVED, I MAY HAVE DISCOVERED THIS YEARS DOWN THE TRACK WHEN IT MAY HAVE CAUSED MUCH MORE DAMAGE TO MY LEFT BREAST, TO THE POINT WHERE I MAY HAVE LOST THE ENTIRE BREAST AND NOT JUST HALF OF IT! SO CLEARLY SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT THE PROCESS FOR DETECTING RUPTURED SILICONE IMPLANTS EARLY ON THE ALLERGAN NEEDS TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE WHEN A FAULTY IMPLANT DOES RUPTURE IN ONE OF THEIR CLIENTS CAUSING IRREVERSIBLE DAMAGE."|ALLERGAN||03/28/2008|V|02/28/2008||R||991284.0|0HP|FTR|1.0||SILICONE IMPLANTS|N|308629|||GOLETA|US|ALLERGAN INC.||CA|93117||110-270||True

FOLLOWING THE SURGERY I AM LEFT WITH A BREAST WHICH IS TAKING A LOT LONGER TO HEAL, I HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS WITH LEFT BREAST FOLLOWING THE SURGERY INCLUDING A LOT OF FLUID BUILD UP AND MULTIPLE DRAINS INSERTED TO HELP WITH THE FLUID DRAINAGE AND HEALING AND I'M STILL EXPERIENCING PAIN. I AM ALSO LEFT WITH UNEVEN BREASTS DUE TO THE COMPLICATION OF THE RUPTURED IMPLANT, AND THE ADD'L BREAST TISSUE REMOVED FROM THE BREAST WITH THE RUPTURED IMPLANT. NOW MY REASONS FOR REPORTING THIS ARE: BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT ALLERGAN PRODUCED A FAULTY IMPLANT WHICH LEFT ME IN THIS PREDICAMENT AS THERE IS NO OTHER INCIDENT -TRAUMATIC OR OTHERWISE- THAT COULD HAVE POSSIBLY CAUSED THIS RUPTURE AND THEY ARE NOT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY, IN FACT THEY ARE NOT EVEN HOLDING UP THEIR END OF THE WARRANTY BECAUSE I DISCOVERED THE RUPTURE DURING SURGERY AND NOT BEFORE WHICH LEADS ME TO THE SECOND REASON FOR REPORTING THIS: THERE IS NO WAY TO DETECT A RUPTURE IN A SILICONE IMPLANT EARLY ON BEFORE THE DAMAGE IS SEVERE. ACCORDING TO ALLERGAN, THEY RECOMMEND GETTING MRIS AFTER A CERTAIN NUMBER OF YEARS OR WHEN SUGGESTED BY A PHYSICIAN. I WAS EXAMINED MORE THAN MOST SILICONE IMPLANT PTS WOULD TYPICALLY BE, SINCE I WAS PART OF A STUDY WHICH REQUIRED CLOSE EXAMINATION AND REGULAR FOLLOW-UPS, AND I WAS NEVER TOLD TO GET AN MRI AND I WAS NEVER GIVEN ANY INDICATION THAT THE IMPLANT COULD HAVE RUPTURED EVEN WHEN I WAS EXPERIENCING SOME DISCOMFORT. CURRENTLY, ALLERGAN HAS THE IMPLANTS AND ARE INVESTIGATING THE CAUSE OF THE RUPTURE AND I'M STILL WAITING TO HEAR BACK FROM THEM. I DO NOT THINK THAT ALLERGAN HAS PUT THE APPROPRIATE MEASURES IN PLACE TO HELP PTS IDENTIFY RUPTURES EARLY ON TO AVOID LONG TERM PROBLEMS, SUCH AS PERMANENT DISFIGURATION AS I'VE EXPERIENCED. AND THEY CERTAINLY ARE NOT FOLLOWING APPROPRIATE BUSINESS PRACTICES TO RESOLVE ISSUES WHEN THEY OCCUR. IT IS COMPLETELY UNFAIR AND UNETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICE TO REFUSE TO PAY OUT THE SURGICAL COSTS OF THE IMPLANT REMOVAL BASED ON WHAT THEY SEE AS A ""LOOP HOLE"" WHEN THEIR WARRANTY SAYS THAT SURGICAL AND IMPLANT REPLACEMENT COSTS WILL BE PAID IF AN IMPLANT IS FAULTY. I DO NOT WANT THEM REPLACED AFTER THE TRAUMA I HAVE EXPERIENCED WITH THE FIRST IMPLANTS BUT I DO WANT THE SURGICAL COSTS FOR REMOVING THE IMPLANTS TO BE PAID FOR BY ALLERGAN AS THIS IS WHAT THEIR WARRANTY IS FOR. I'M SURE THEY DO THIS TO MOST PTS IN THE SAME SITUATION BECAUSE OF ALL THE PEOPLE I KNOW WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS, NONE ARE TOLD TO GET MRIS, SO I DON'T SEE HOW ANYONE IS GOING TO BE AWARE OF A RUPTURE UNTIL IT IS TOO LATE AND THE EFFECTS ARE IRREVERSIBLE. I CONSIDER MYSELF LUCKY TO HAVE DETECTED THE RUPTURE NOW, HAD I NOT TAKEN ANY ACTION TO HAVE THEM REMOVED, I MAY HAVE DISCOVERED THIS YEARS DOWN THE TRACK WHEN IT MAY HAVE CAUSED MUCH MORE DAMAGE TO MY LEFT BREAST, TO THE POINT WHERE I MAY HAVE LOST THE ENTIRE BREAST AND NOT JUST HALF OF IT! SO CLEARLY SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT THE PROCESS FOR DETECTING RUPTURED SILICONE IMPLANTS EARLY ON THE ALLERGAN NEEDS TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE WHEN A FAULTY IMPLANT DOES RUPTURE IN ONE OF THEIR CLIENTS CAUSING IRREVERSIBLE DAMAGE."|ALLERGAN||03/28/2008|V|02/28/2008||R||991285.0|0HP|FTR|2.0||SILICONE IMPLANTS|N|308629|||GOLETA|US|ALLERGAN INC.||CA|93117||110-270||True
