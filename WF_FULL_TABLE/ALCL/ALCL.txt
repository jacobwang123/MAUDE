THE REPORTED DEVICE WAS INTACT AT THE TIME OF PRODUCTION AND MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. REPORTED EVENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN THE LABELING: PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENT. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. YOU SHOULD PERFORM SELF-EXAMINATION OF YOUR BREASTS EVERY MONTH FOR CANCER SCREENING. HOWEVER, THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU DISTINGUISH THE IMPLANT FROM YOUR BREAST TISSUE. THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGES IN IMPLANT SHAPE, MAY BE SIGNS OF A RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT.

6498449|72963713|N|1||THIS REPORT IS SUBMITTED IN RESPONSE TO FDA NOTICE TITLED BREAST IMPLANT-ASSOCIATED ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (BIA-ALCL) PROVIDED ON 21/MAR/2017. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CASES REFERENCED IN THE NOTICE IS 359, INCLUDING 9 DEATHS. THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE NOTICE CLASSIFIES THE ALCL EVENTS IN DIFFERENT CATEGORIES, INCLUDING TYPES OF DEVICE, ASSOCIATED ADVERSE EVENTS, PRESENTATION, AND DIAGNOSIS DETAILS, BUT DOES NOT IDENTIFY SPECIFIC DEVICES OR PATIENTS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO INDIVIDUALIZE THIS INFORMATION INTO SPECIFIC REPORTS, AND BY DEFINITION ALREADY INCLUDES EVENTS REPORTED BY ALLERGAN IN THE PAST. THEREFORE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH 21 CFR 803, THIS REPORT WILL REPRESENT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF RECEIPT OF THE NOTICE AND DOCUMENTATION OF ALLERGAN'S ATTEMPT TO INVESTIGATE ADVERSE EVENTS IDENTIFIED IN THAT NOTICE. THIS REPORT WILL NOT SUBSTITUTE FOR ANY INVESTIGATION INTO COMPLAINTS RECEIVED WHERE INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS OR ALLERGAN DEVICES ARE IDENTIFIED, INCLUSIVE OR EXCLUSIVE OF THE 359 CASES MENTIONED IN THE NOTICE. (B)(4). THE EVENTS OF DEATH, LYMPHOMA-ALCL, LYMPHOMA, SEROMA, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, AND BREAST LUMPS ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THESE EVENTS. SALINE DEVICE LABELING: RADIATION TO THE BREAST Â¿ ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE IN VIVO EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, ASYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER THESE ADDITIONAL SURGERIES. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF DEFLATION. ADDITIONAL COMPLICATIONS Â¿ AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. CALCIUM DEPOSITS CAN FORM IN THE TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT WITH SYMPTOMS THAT MAY INCLUDE PAIN AND FIRMNESS. LYMPHADENOPATHY HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED IN SOME WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS. IN THE PASS STUDY, AT LEAST 1 REOPERATION WAS PERFORMED ON 315 PATIENTS (36.5%) THROUGH 10 YEARS. A TOTAL OF 424 REOPERATIONS WERE PERFORMED. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR REOPERATION THROUGH 10 YEARS ON AUGMENTATION PATIENTS WAS IMPLANT DEFLATION AT 21.7%. THE PERCENTAGE OF REOPERATIONS DUE TO LUMP/MASS/CYST INCREASED FROM 8.5% OF 293 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 5 YEARS TO 13.9% OF 424 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 10 YEARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF LUMPS, MASSES, AND CYSTS CAN BE EXPECTED TO NATURALLY INCREASE AS PATIENTS AGE AND COULD BE AN EXPLANATION FOR THE INCREASE. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. FOR MORE COMPLETE AND UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ON FDAÂ¿S ANALYSIS AND REVIEW OF THE ALCL IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST IMPLANTS PLEASE VISIT: HTTP://WWW.FDA.GOV/MEDICALDEVICES/PRODUCTSANDMEDICALPROCEDURES/IMPLANTSANDPROSTHETICS/BREASTIMPLANTS/UCM239995.HTM YOU ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO REPORT ANY PRODUCT PROBLEM OR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT TO ALLERGAN. DEATHS MUST BE REPORTED TO ALLERGAN AND FDA. SILICONE DEVICE LABELING: ONE OF THE KEY COMPLICATIONS REPORTED IS CALLED Â¿CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE.Â¿ CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS A TIGHTENING OF THE SCAR TISSUE (ALSO CALLED A CAPSULE) THAT NORMALLY FORMS AROUND THE BREAST IMPLANT DURING THE HEALING PROCESS AFTER SURGERY. IN SOME WOMEN, THE SCAR TISSUE (CAPSULE) SQUEEZES THE IMPLANT. THIS RESULTS IN FIRMNESS OR HARDENING OF THE BREAST, AND IT IS A RISK FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE. DEGREES OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE ARE CLASSIFIED BY THE BAKER GRADING SCALE.1 CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BAKER GRADES III AND IV ARE THE MOST SEVERE. BAKER GRADE III OFTEN RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SURGERY (REOPERATION) BECAUSE OF PAIN AND POSSIBLY ABNORMAL APPEARANCE. BAKER GRADE IV USUALLY RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR REOPERATION BECAUSE OF PAIN AND UNACCEPTABLE APPEARANCE. DO NOT TREAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BY CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY OR FORCEFUL EXTERNAL COMPRESSION, WHICH WILL LIKELY RESULT IN IMPLANT DAMAGE, RUPTURE, FOLDS, AND/OR HEMATOMA. ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. YOU SHOULD PERFORM SELF-EXAMINATION OF YOUR BREASTS EVERY MONTH FOR CANCER SCREENING. HOWEVER, THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU DISTINGUISH THE IMPLANT FROM YOUR BREAST TISSUE. THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGES IN IMPLANT SHAPE, MAY BE SIGNS OF A RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. THESE SIGNS SHOULD BE REPORTED TO YOUR SURGEON AND POSSIBLY EVALUATED WITH AN MRI. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT.

BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. BREAST IMPLANTS RUPTURE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. RUPTURES CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO RUPTURE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, STRESSING THE IMPLANT DURING IMPLANTATION AND WEAKENING IT, FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL, EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED), TRAUMA, COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING, AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF RUPTURE FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT. IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF RUPTURE. LABORATORY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RUPTURE ARE ONGOING. SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE. IF RUPTURE OCCURS, SILICONE GEL MAY EITHER REMAIN WITHIN THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), MOVE OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE (EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), OR MOVE OUTSIDE THE BREAST (GEL MIGRATION).

FIBROUS CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE REMAINS A COMMON COMPLICATION FOLLOWING BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY AND IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. THE CAUSE OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS UNKNOWN, HOWEVER IT IS MOST LIKELY MULTIFACTORIAL AND MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HAEMATOMA, AND SEROMA. CONTRACTURE DEVELOPS TO VARYING DEGREES, UNILATERALLY OR BILATERALLY, AND MAY OCCUR WITHIN WEEKS TO YEARS AFTER SURGERY. CONTRACTURE OF THE FIBROUS CAPSULAR TISSUE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT MAY CAUSE A RANGE OF SYMPTOMS INCLUDING FIRMNESS, DISCOMFORT, PAIN, DISTORTION, PALPABILITY, AND/OR DISPLACEMENT. SEVERE CASES ARE CONSIDERED THE MOST CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT, AND MAY REQUIRE SURGICAL INTERVENTION. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY RECUR SUBSEQUENT TO CORRECTIVE SURGICAL PROCEDURES. DO NOT TREAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BY EXTERNAL COMPRESSION OR MASSAGE, WHICH MAY RESULT IN IMPLANT DAMAGE, DEFLATION, FOLDS, AND/OR HAEMATOMA.""

REPORTS IN THE MEDICAL LITERATURE INDICATE THAT PATIENTS WITH BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT AT A GREATER RISK THAN THOSE WITHOUT BREAST IMPLANTS FOR DEVELOPING BREAST CANCER. REPORTS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT BREAST IMPLANTS MAY INTERFERE WITH OR DELAY BREAST CANCER DETECTION BY MAMMOGRAPHY AND/OR BIOPSY; HOWEVER, OTHER REPORTS IN THE PUBLISHED MEDICAL LITERATURE INDICATE THAT BREAST IMPLANTS NEITHER SIGNIFICANTLY DELAY BREAST CANCER DETECTION NOR ADVERSELY AFFECT CANCER SURVIVAL OF WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS. A LARGE FOLLOW-UP STUDY REPORTED NO EVIDENCE OF AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND CANCER, AND EVEN SHOWED A DECREASED INCIDENCE OF BREAST CANCER COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION. ONE STUDY HAS REPORTED AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF BRAIN CANCER IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS AS COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION. THE INCIDENCE OF BRAIN CANCER, HOWEVER, WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS WHEN COMPARED TO WOMEN WHO HAD OTHER PLASTIC SURGERIES A PUBLISHED REVIEW OF 4 LARGE STUDIES IN WOMEN WITH COSMETIC IMPLANTS AND AN ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP STUDY CONCLUDED THAT THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT SUPPORT AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BRAIN CANCER AND BREAST IMPLANTS. AN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL REVIEW ALSO LENT SUPPORT TO THE LACK OF CAUSATION BETWEEN IMPLANTS AND ANY TYPE OF CANCER. STUDIES HAVE REPORTED AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF RESPIRATORY/LUNG CANCER IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS. OTHER STUDIES OF WOMEN IN SWEDEN AND DENMARK HAVE FOUND THAT WOMEN WHO GET BREAST IMPLANTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE CURRENT SMOKERS THAN WOMEN WHO GET BREAST REDUCTION SURGERY OR OTHER TYPES OF COSMETIC SURGERY. SEVERAL LARGE STUDIES HAVE FOUND NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND RESPIRATORY/LUNG CANCER. TWO STUDIES REPORTED AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF CERVICAL/VULVAR CANCER IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS. ANOTHER LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP STUDY SHOWED EQUIVALENT INCIDENCES OF CERVICAL CANCER IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION. OTHER RECENT LARGE STUDIES CONCLUDED THAT THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT SUPPORT AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM CANCERS AND BREAST IMPLANTS. THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL STUDIES PUBLISHED THAT EXAMINED THE RISK OF OTHER TYPES OF CANCERS, E.G., THYROID CANCERS, URINARY SYSTEM CANCERS, SARCOMA, ENDOCRINE CANCER, CONNECTIVE TISSUE CANCER, CANCER OF THE EYE, AND UNSPECIFIED CANCERS IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS.

REPORTED EVENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN THE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM.

IN 1994 I STARTED TO HAVE MAJOR FATIGUE, WEIRD CHEMICAL SENSITIVITIES, A GROIN CYST DEVELOPED (OUT OF NO WHERE THAT EVERYONE SAID IS JUST FAT BUT NEVER BEEN TESTED) AND INTERSTITIAL CYSTITIS (INFLAMMATION OF BLADDER). IN 1995,, THYROID CANCER AS WELL, THYROID REMOVED. IN 1996 CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. REMOVED IMPLANTS, PUT UNDER MUSCLE, TEXTURED SALINE. PS WHO DID SURGERY (WHO GOT HIS LICENSE TAKEN AWAY YEARS LATER FOR DOING CRYSTAL METH AND HAVING SEX WITH PATIENTS, PUTTING IN IMPLANTS BIGGER THAN WHAT GIRLS WANTED, EVEN GAUZE WAS FOUND INSIDE ONE GIRL'S BREASTS YEARS LATER WHEN SHE WAS HAVING A LOT OF PAIN AND THEY COULDN'T FIGURE WHAT IT WAS) SAID HE HAD TO MAKE MY IMPLANTS LARGER THAN WHAT I WAS (A SMALL C). I ASKED FOR A LARGE C, I WOKE A DD. TODAY I AM A DDD BECAUSE I'VE GAINED WEIGHT. DIAGNOSED WITH CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME, THEN LATER FIBROMYALGIA. TWENTY TWO YEARS OF CHRONIC NECK PAIN, STIFFNESS AND NOW ARTHRITIS IN MY NECK. WEIRD ONION ALLERGY DEVELOPED IN 1997. FREEZING COLD AND TINGLING AND NUMBNESS RIGHT HAND FINGERS AND RIGHT FOOT TOES, WEIRD AND RANDOM ITCHING, CREEPY CRAWLY FEELINGS IN SCALP AND OTHER PARTS OF BODY, CHRONIC BODY CHILLS, CHRONIC CERVICAL MIGRAINES, MAJOR WEIGHT GAIN, CAN'T LOSE WEIGHT DESPITE DIETING, EXTREME DRY SCALP, FIBROIDS, LOW SEX DRIVE (GETTING WORSE), BLURRY VISION, RANDOM TOOTH SENSITIVITIES, CHOLESTASIS DURING PREGNANCY, BREASTS PAINS, CHRONIC INSOMNIA (DON'T GO INTO 4TH STAGE OF SLEEP), DARK EYE CIRCLES GETTING WORSE YEAR BY YEAR, UPPER ARM PAIN BY IMPLANTS, KNEE PAIN, WEIRD AND RANDOM ELBOW PAIN, JOINT PAINS, MUSCLE STIFFNESS, UNDER ARM PIT SWOLLEN LYMPH NODES, MAJOR EXERCISE INTOLERANCE, IBS ISSUES, UNEXPLAINED RAISED LIVER ENZYMES, HIGH CHOLESTEROL, CHRONIC CONSTIPATION, GASTRITIS WITH BLEEDING, STOMACH ACID ISSUES, CHRONIC SORE THROATS (IN BEGINNING), WEIRD UNDER EYE TWITCHING, SWOLLEN LYMPH NODES, WEAKNESS, HAIR LOSS, RIGHT HAND PAIN/STIFFNESS WHEN WRITING, ISCHEMIC COLITIS FROM PASSING OUT FOR NO EXPLAINED REASON, MAJOR BRAIN FOG, MAJOR CONCENTRATION ISSUES, MAJOR MEMORY ISSUES, CHRONIC AND UNEXPLAINED POST NASAL DRIP FOR 20 PLUS YEARS (SOMETIMES WITH BLACK STREAKS), HIATAL HERNIA, COMPLETE NUMBNESS IN THE BOTTOM OF MY RIGHT THUMB AFTER EATING OR DRINKING SOMETHING COLD, INABILITY TO HAVE A SECOND CHILD, RANDOM HEART PALPITATIONS, WOLF PARKINSON'S WHITE (HAD TO HAVE HEART ABLATION), GALLSTONES, POSSIBLE GALLBLADDER REMOVAL BECAUSE OF POSSIBLE POLYP. I'M NOW SCARED OF THE CANCER CALLED ALCL NOW LINKED TO BREASTS IMPLANTS, ESPECIALLY THE TEXTURED ONE, WHICH I HAVE. I'M A MESS AND AM JUST USE TO IT. I HAVE LOST MY LIFE, MY QUALITY OF LIFE, AND MY CAREER. THESE ILLNESSES HAVE PUT ME INTO DEBT. I CAN BARELY WORK OR TAKE CARE OF MY DAUGHTER BY MYSELF. AT LEAST I CAN'T DO BOTH, OT'S ONE OR THE OTHER. THANK GOD I HAVE A HUSBAND WHO CAN STEP IN AND BE THE MOM AND THE HOUSE KEEPER AND THE COOK, ETC... I'VE FOCUSED ON EVERY BODY PART WITH EVERY SPECIALIST IN EVERY FIELD, BUT I NEVER FOCUSED ON MY BREASTS BECAUSE I WAS ALWAYS TOLD IT COULDN'T BE MY IMPLANTS. LAST WEEK I HAD A BREAST SONOGRAM AND IT SHOWED A .7CM SWOLLEN LYMPH NODE IN MY RIGHT BREAST (NOT SUSPICIOUS FOR CANCER). TODAY I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BAKER GRADE 4 CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IN MY RIGHT BREAST, BY A RECONSTRUCTIVE BREAST SURGEON. GOD ONLY KNOWS HOW LONG I'VE HAD IT! SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE AND SOMEONE NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THOUSANDS OF WOMEN LOSING THEIR LIVES AND QUALITY OF LIVES FROM EITHER SALINE OR SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. IMPORTANT INFORMATION: MCGHAN SILTEX SALINE FILLED MAMMARY PROTHESIS (LOT #FW7879 LEFT 390CC AND LOT #FW2756 RIGHT 390CC) IMPLANTED BY DR (B)(6) OF (B)(6) ON (B)(6) 1993 OVER THE MUSCLE WITH RECONSTRUCTION. AFTER CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE AND IMPLANT RUPTURES, MCGHAN STYLE #468 TEXTURED SALINE IMPLANTS (CAT #27-468561 LEFT #HK6992 650CC'S RIGHT LOT# GK5386 700CC'S) WAS IMPLANTED BY DR (B)(6) OF (B)(6) ON (B)(6) 1996. ON (B)(6) 2017 CAPSULAR CONTRACTION AGAIN, IMPLANTS TO BE REMOVED AND TOTAL ENBLOC CAPSULECTOMY SOON, HOPEFULLY. I AM IN A (B)(6) GROUP WITH OVER 17,800 WOMEN (AND CONSTANTLY GROWING) WITH SIMILAR STORIES AS MINE WHO HAVE EITHER SILICONE OR SALINE BREASTS IMPLANTS. WHEN THEY EXPLANT THEM VIA AN ENBLOC CAPSULECTOMY, ALL OF THEIR SYMPTOMS AND ILLNESSES GO AWAY. TESTS GO BACK TO NORMAL. WOMEN'S EYES, FACES, SKIN START TO LOOK BETTER, HEALTHIER AND WOMEN'S AUTOIMMUNE ISSUES DISAPPEAR. THEY START TO DETOX AND HEAL AND CAN START TO REGAIN SOME OF THEIR LIVES. IMPLANTS COME OUT WITH MOLD AND TOXINS. THE IMPLANTS AND THE WOMEN'S BODIES ARE TESTED AND ARE FOUND TO HAVE TOXINS, MOLDS, SILICONE AND THE CHEMICALS WHICH MAKE UP SILICONE IN THEM AND ALL OVER THEM. THE BREAST IMPLANT INDUSTRY KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE PUTTING INTO WOMEN'S BODIES AND WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THEM, IT JUST NEEDS TO BE PROVEN IN A COURT OF LAW AND IT'S TIME. CANCER IS NOW LINKED TO BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE THAT TYPE OF CANCER BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE IS TO TAKE OUT THE IMPLANTS AND TEST THE FLUID AROUND THE IMPLANTS.

INITIAL CLINICAL PRESENTATION (B)(6) 2010. THIS IS (B)(6) FEMALE WITH A HISTORY OF DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU OF THE LEFT BREAST DIAGNOSED IN 1998. SHE SUBSEQUENTLY UNDERWENT A LEFT MASTECTOMY WHERE THE SPECIMEN WEIGHT WAS 596 GRAMS. SHE UNDERWENT IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION WITH PLACEMENT OF SUBMUSCULAR TISSUE EXPANDER BY PLASTIC SURGEON #1. THE TISSUE EXPANDER WAS PLACED COMPLETELY SUBPECTORAL AND ALSO IN A SUBSERRATUS POCKET. THE EXPANDER WAS REMOVED IN 1999 AND REPLACED WITH A MCGHAN 440 ML DUAL-CHAMBER SILICONE AND SALINE-FILLED IMPLANT. SHE RECEIVED NO POSTOPERATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY OR RADIATION THERAPY. WITHIN A YEAR, SHE DEVELOPED SIGNIFICANT HARDENING AND DISTORTION OF THE LEFT RECONSTRUCTED BREAST WITH GRADUAL ELEVATION OF THE IMPLANT, TIGHTENING OF THE TISSUE AROUND THE IMPLANT, AND DISCOMFORT IN THE LEFT CHEST WALL. SHE WAS SEEN IN EVALUATION IN 2006 BY PLASTIC SURGEON #2, WHO RE-OPERATED ON HER LEFT BREAST AND REMOVED THE EXISTING IMPLANT, PERFORMED PERIPROSTHETIC CAPSULOTOMIES WHICH WERE NOT SPECIFIED IN THE OPERATIVE NOTE, SUBMITTED CAPSULAR TISSUE FOR HISTOLOGIC EXAMINATION (INTERPRETED AS NEGATIVE) AND REPLACED A SMALLER SALINE IMPLANT. THIS WAS AN ALLERGAN-STYLE 68MP SALINE IMPLANT, SIZE 390-420 ML. THIS RECONSTRUCTION WAS SOFT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, BUT WITHIN 1 YEAR, SHE HAD RECURRENCE OF THE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE WITH TIGHTENING OF THE TISSUE AROUND THE IMPLANT, GRADUAL ELEVATION OF THE IMPLANT LOCATION, AND DISCOMFORT IN THE LEFT CHEST WALL. SHE WAS SEEN IN EVALUATION IN 2009 BY PLASTIC SURGEON #4 WHO RECOMMENDED THAT SHE CONSIDER REVISION OF HER RECONSTRUCTION WITH THE ADDITION OF AN CELLULAR DERMAL MATRIX TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR RECURRENCE OF HER CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE AROUND THE DEVICE. PLASTIC SURGEON #4 ALSO RECOMMENDED AUTOLOGOUS ABDOMINAL FLAP RECONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES. THE PT WAS INTERESTED IN CONSIDERING A DIEP FLAP AND PLASTIC SURGEON #4 REFERRED HER TO ME ((B)(6) SURGEON #5) FOR EVALUATION AND CONSIDERATION OF A FREE FLAP BREAST RECONSTRUCTION PROCEDURE. THE PT'S PAST MEDICAL HISTORY WAS ADDITIONALLY SIGNIFICANT FOR A HISTORY OF HYPOTHYROIDISM AND BLADDER PROLAPSE. HER MEDICATIONS INCLUDED SYNTHROID 88 MCG DAILY, VITAMIN D, AND ADVIL. SHE IS A NONSMOKER AND DRINKS ALCOHOL RARELY. INITIAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION, (B)(6) 2010, SHOWED THE PT WAS 155 CM TALL, 70.3 KG. THE LEFT BREAST WAS ABSENT THROUGH A TRANSVERSE STEWART-TYPE MASTECTOMY INCISION. THERE WAS AN IMPLANT PRESENT IN THE SUBPECTORAL POSITION ON THE LEFT SIDE. THERE WAS A BAKER GRADE IV CAPSULE CONTRACTURE AROUND THIS DEVICE, WHICH WAS RIGIDLY AFFIXED TO HER CHEST WALL AND SOMEWHAT TENDER TO MANIPULATION. THE WOUNDS WERE WELL HEALED WITH NO EVIDENCE OF SCAR HYPERTROPHY. THE RIGHT BREAST WAS MORE PTOTIC WITH A DEGREE OF PSEUDOPTOSIS, LATERAL BOTTOMING OUT AND A WISE-PATTERN SCAR FROM PREVIOUS MASTOPEXY - RESULTING IN SUBSTANTIAL SHAPE AND VOLUME ASYMMETRY. ON THE LEFT SIDE, THE STERNAL NOTCH TO INFRAMAMMARY FOLD DISTANCE WAS 20 CM. ON THE RIGHT SIDE, THE STERNAL NOTCH TO INFRAMAMMARY FOLD DISTANCE WAS 23 CM. THE MID-CLAVICULAR POINT TO NIPPLE DISTANCE ON THE RIGHT WAS 21 CM. EXAMINATION OF THE ABDOMEN SHOWED A GENEROUS AMOUNT OF TISSUE IN THE LOWER 1/3 OF THE ABDOMEN FOR ABDOMINAL FLAP CONSIDERATION. INITIAL IMPRESSION, (B)(6) 2010. THIS WAS A (B)(6) FEMALE WITH RECURRENT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE FOLLOWING 2 PREVIOUS IMPLANT-BASED RECONSTRUCTION SURGERIES ON THE LEFT SIDE. THE LEFT BREAST RECONSTRUCTION SHOWED ELEVATION OF THE INFRAMAMMARY FOLD AND A SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE AROUND THE EXISTING IMPLANT. I RECOMMENDED REMOVAL OF THE EXISTING LEFT BREAST IMPLANT, RECONSTRUCTION OF THE ORIGINS OF THE LEFT PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE AND RECONSTRUCTION OF THE LEFT BREAST WITH A FREE ABDOMINAL FLAP. OPERATIVE FINDINGS ON (B)(6) 2011: THE LEFT BREAST IMPLANT CAPSULE WAS OPENED AND CONTAINED A CLOUDY YELLOW FLUID UNDER ENORMOUS PRESSURE, THE FLUID SQUIRTED OUT OF THE CAPSULAR INCISION AND TRAVELED AT LEAST 56 INCHES. THERE WAS A COLLECTION OF GELATINOUS MATERIAL WITHIN THE CAPSULE AS WELL AS AN INTACT SALINE BREAST IMPLANT. THE CAPSULE WAS THICKENED AND COVERED WITH PLAQUE-LIKE LESIONS INTERNALLY. A TOTAL CAPSULECTOMY WAS PERFORMED, THE PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE WAS REATTACHED TO ITS 5TH RIB ORIGINS. THE PERIPROSTHETIC FLUID WAS CAPTURED, AND ALL MATERIAL WAS SENT FOR PATHOLOGIC AND CYTOLOGIC EVALUATION INCLUDING FROZEN SECTION WHICH WAS CONSISTENT WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF ALCL. THE REMAINING RECONSTRUCTION WAS ABANDONED PENDING FINAL PATHOLOGY EVALUATION SPECIMEN. DETAILED PATHOLOGY FINDINGS: LEFT BREAST PERI-PROSTHETIC MATERIAL.

BASED ON INFO REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL, BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGAN'S AND OTHER MFRS' BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMENT FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION SHOWED A SYMMETRICAL BREASTS WITH NO OVERLYING SKIN OR NIPPLE CHANGES. THERE WERE TWO LARGE MOBILE NODES PALPABLE IN THE LEFT AXILLA. INITIAL BREAST MAMMOGRAPHY AND ULTRASONOGRAPHY CONFIRMED LEFT AXILLARY LYMPHADENOPATHY BUT DID NOT SHOW ANY PERI-IMPLANT FLUID COLLECTION. BIOPSY OF THE LEFT AXILLARY MASS SHOWED FINDINGS CONSISTENT WITH CLASSIC HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA, NODULAR SCLEROSING TYPE. IT LACKED TWO TYPICAL STAINS-CD15 AND PAX5. PET-CT SHOWED A 5-CM AREA OF PET-AVID LEFT AXILLARY LYMPHADENOPATHY. HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA STAGE IA WAS DIAGNOSED. THE PT THEN HAD TWO CYCLES OF ADRIAMYCIN, BLEOMYCIN, VINBLASTINE, AND DACARBAZINE (ABVD) AND 2000 GY OF FIELD RADIATION TO THE LEFT AXILLA. HER INITIAL TREATMENT WAS COMPLETED IN (B)(6) 2011. F/U CT SCAN IN (B)(6) 2011, SHOWED A DECREASE IN THE SIZE OF THE LEFT AXILLARY LYMPHADENOPATHY. UNILATERAL FLUID COLLECTION, HOWEVER, WAS NOTED AROUND THE LEFT BREAST IMPLANT (FIGURE). THE FLUID INCREASED IN SIZE AND SHE PRESENTED 6 MONTHS ALTER WITH LEAKAGE OF SEROUS FLUID FROM HER LEFT BREAST. CYTOLOGY OF THE PERI-IMPLANT FLUID SHOWED CD30+ LYMPHOMA CELLS OF INDETERMINATE LINEAGE. DIFFERENT DIAGNOSIS INCLUDED RECURRENT HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA OR IMPLANT-ASSOCIATED ANAPLASTIC LARGE-CELL LYMPHOMA. REPEAT PET-CT SHOWED PET-AVID AREAS ON BILATERAL AXILLARY LYMPH NODES. BOTH IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED WITH CAPSULECTOMIES. IN (B)(6) 2011, SHE REPEAT PET-CT SHOWED PET-AVID AREAS IN BILATERAL AXILLARY LYMPH NODES. BOTH IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED WITH CAPSULECTOMIES. IN (B)(6) 2011, SHE WAS TREATED WITH FOUR CYCLES OF SALVAGE CHEMOTHERAPY WITH GEMCITABINE AND CISPLATIN FOR ASSUMED RECURRENT HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA. F/U SONOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT BREAST 1 MONTH LATER SHOWED A HYPOECHOIC MASS. BIOPSY OF THE MASS SHOWED SIMILAR CELLS FROM THE PERI-IMPLANT FLUID, WHICH WERE CD30+ LYMPHOMA CELLS OF INDETERMINATE ORIGIN. THE MASS WAS RESECTED IN (B)(6) 2012, AND PATHOLOGICAL TESTS SHOWED (B)(6), SEROMA-ASSOCIATED (LARGE-CELL LYMPHOMA (ALK-NEGATIVE ALCL). A RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF ALL SIDES SHOWED LARGE CELLS CHARACTERISTIC OF ALK-NEGATIVE ALCL. SUBSTANTIAL OVERLAP IN MORPHOLOGY AND IMMUNOPHENOTYPE OF CELLS FROM THE INITIAL AXILLARY LYMPH NODE BIOPSY, THE PERI-IMPLANT FLUID AND THE FINAL LEFT BREAST MASS BIOPSY SUGGESTED THE SAME MANIFESTATIONS OF THE ALCL. THE PRESENTATION IS UNIQUE BECAUSE ALK-NEGATIVE ALCL PRESENTED WITH A PATHOLOGICAL AXILLARY LYMPH NODE INSTEAD OF THE TYPICAL PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA.

AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WITH DEFORMITY. CALCIUM DEPOSITS CAN FORM IN THE TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT WITH SYMPTOMS THAT MAY INCLUDE PAIN AND FIRMNESS. LYMPHADENOPATHY HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED IN SOME WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS. PTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADD'L SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER THESE ADD'L SURGERIES.

5761253|48540699|D|1||I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER IN MY RIGHT BREAST IN (B)(6) 2010. I CONTACTED A BREAST CANCER SURGEON AND SHE TOLD ME I NEEDED TO HAVE A MASTECTOMY SINCE THERE WERE 2 TUMORS IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF MY BREAST. I ALSO CONTACTED A RECONSTRUCTIVE/PLASTIC SURGEON. I AGREED TO HAVE AN IMPLANT PUT IN AT THE SAME TIME AS MY SURGERY. THE PLASTIC SURGEON PUT IN A TISSUE EXPANDER FOR THREE MONTHS AND ON (B)(6) 2011, I HAD AN ALLERGAN TEXTURED BREAST IMPLANT PUT IN. THE STYLE OF THE IMPLANT HAD NOT BEEN APPROVED BY THE FDA YET, SO I SIGNED A CONSENT FORM TO BE PART OF A STUDY. I READ THE AGREEMENT THOROUGHLY AND THERE WERE ONLY TWO POSSIBLE RISKS: INFECTION OR COMPARTMENT CONTRACTURE. THERE WAS NO MENTION OF LYMPHOMA CANCER. APPROXIMATELY 2 YEARS LATER THE FDA APPROVED THIS STYLE IMPLANT AND THE STUDY WAS ENDED. ON (B)(6) 2016 MY RIGHT BREAST BECAME TIGHT AND HARD. IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS IT BECAME LARGER AND LARGER. I CONTACTED MY PLASTIC SURGEON AND SHE ASKED ME TO TAKE A PICTURE OF MY BREAST AND SEND TO HER, SINCE I WAS OUT OF TOWN AT THE TIME. SHE ORDERED AN ANTIBIOTIC AND MADE AN APPOINTMENT FOR ME TO SEE HER THE FOLLOWING WEEK. I WENT TO SEE HER AND SHE TOOK MORE PICTURES AND TOLD ME IT WAS PROBABLY AN INFECTION AND I SHOULD CONTINUE ANTIBIOTIC. MY BREAST GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER AND MY SURGEON DECIDED TO REMOVE MY IMPLANT. DURING THE SURGERY SHE TOOK A TISSUE SAMPLE AND THEN PUT IN A NEW TEXTURED IMPLANT AND CLOSED UP INCISION. ON (B)(6), THE PATHOLOGY REPORT CAME BACK WITH THE DIAGNOSIS OF ALCL. IT WAS CONFIRMED BY A PET CT SCAN. MY SURGEON SAID THAT SHE KNEW THE DOCTOR WHO SPECIALIZED IN ALCL AND THAT HE WAS AT THE (B)(6). MY HUSBAND AND I FLEW TO (B)(6) TO HAVE IMPLANT AND SURROUNDING SCAR TISSUE REMOVED BY THE SURGEONS WHO ARE THE AUTHORITY ON THIS DISEASE. ALSO, THE RESEARCH ON THIS DISEASE IS BEING DONE BY A TEAM THERE. THEY HAVE SEEN MOST OF THE DIAGNOSED CASES IN THE US. I HAD OTHER TESTS DONE THERE: AN ULTRASOUND AND A CHEST X-RAY. I SPOKE WITH THE DOCTOR AND HE TOLD ME THAT THE LYMPHOMA WAS ONLY IN THE FLUID SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT AND NOT IN THE SCAR TISSUE (CAPSULE) OR IN MY LYMPH NODES. I HAD THE SURGERY ON (B)(6) 2016 AND WAS INFORMED THAT ALL OF THE CANCER CELLS WERE REMOVED AND I WAS NOW CANCER FREE. I DECIDED TO HAVE A SMOOTH SILICONE IMPLANT PUT IN DURING THE SURGERY RATHER THAN COME BACK LATER FOR ADDITIONAL RECONSTRUCTION. THE DOCTOR TOLD ME THAT NONE OF THE ALCL CASES HAD EVER INVOLVED A SMOOTH IMPLANT.

5808310|50110352|D|1||THOUSANDS OF KNOWN WOMEN ARE SICK FROM A SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. EACH OF THEM KNOWS THE TRUTH NOW. FDA HAS SOMEHOW ALLOWED THE SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT MFRS TO HIDE THE HIGH LEVEL OF TOXICITY OF SILICONE, PLATINUM AND OF THE OTHER 35 + DANGEROUS CHEMICALS THAT USE TO MAKE SILICONE AND SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS, THAT TRIGGER A BIOCHEMICAL MOLECULAR DISRUPTION THAT BRING UP SICKNESSES THAT WERE NOT PRESENT BEFORE THE IMPLANTS AND THAT GO AWAY AFTER THE EXPLANTS, WITH SOME CASES OF IRREVERSIBLE DAMAGE. ON NOVEMBER 17, 2006, THE FDA'S APPROVAL ORDER REQUIRED SIX VERY SPECIFIC POST-APPROVAL STUDIES CONDITIONS, TWO OF THE STUDIES TO MONITOR LONG TERM SAFETY FOR TEN YEARS. THEY WERE NOT FOLLOWED AND SO THERE IS NO SAFETY DATA FOR THOSE STUDIES. THE ADJUNCT 5-YEAR STUDY HAD A LOW F/U RATE OF 13.8%, THE LARGE STUDY WAS ALLOWED TO BE CUT SHORT AT YEAR 7 INSTEAD OF 10 WITH A LOW F/U RATE OF 20.1% AND IT WAS IGNORED, THE CORE STUDY HAD A F/U RATE OF 62% BUT THE REPORT SCHEDULE STOPS SHORT AT YEAR 6 INSTEAD OF 10 ON NOVEMBER 13, 2012. THE FDA MENTOR PMA, THE MANUFACTURE DOCUMENT, STATES SHELF LIFE TO BE FIVE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF STERILIZATION, YET THEY ARE MARKETED FOR UP TO 10 YEARS TO STAY IN THE BODY WITHOUT ANY SAFETY EVIDENCE. THE (B)(6) STUDY FROM 2013 RUN BY THE (B)(6), FUNDED BY THE THREE BREAST IMPLANT MFRS, DOES NOT QUALIFY AS AN INDEPENDENT STUDY FOR THE ASTOUNDING CONFLICT OF INTEREST IN REGARDS TO THE PLASTIC SURGEONS THAT PROFIT LARGELY FROM THE SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS AND, THE MFRS THEMSELVES THAT PROFIT FROM THEIR OWN SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. ALL THE PREVIOUS SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT SYMPTOMS FROM THE 1990S ARE REPEATING THEMSELVES WITH THE CURRENT SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS, THUS PROVING RECURRING LACK OF SAFETY. A FEW PEOPLE FOLLOWING THIS MATTER HAVE MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED, BUT NOW THOUSANDS OF WOMEN HAVE GROUPED TOGETHER TO SHARE THEIR RECORDS WITH (B)(6) AND FOR THEIR OWN PROTECTION THEY HAVE ALSO TAKEN MEASURES TO SHARE THEIR RECORDS AMONG THEMSELVES AND HAVE THOSE RECORDS SAFEGUARDED WITH THEIR OWN ATTORNEYS. PRIVATE INTERESTS CANNOT SILENCE OR BUY OUT RECORDED MEDICAL EVIDENCE FROM THOUSANDS OF SICK WOMEN FROM SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS ANY LONGER.

ANALYSIS OF THE MICROBIOME IN BREAST IMPLANTÂ¿ASSOCIATED ALCL SPECIMENS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WITH SPECIES IDENTIFIED IN NONTUMOR CAPSULE SPECIMENS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER PROPORTION OF RALSTONIA SPP. PRESENT IN ALCL SPECIMENS COMPARED WITH NONTUMOR CAPSULE SPECIMENS (P < 0.05). IN CONTRAST, SIGNIFICANTLY MORE STAPHYLOCOCCUS SPP. WERE FOUND ASSOCIATED WITH NONTUMOR CAPSULE SPECIMENS COMPARED WITH BREAST IMPLANTÂ¿ASSOCIATED ALCL SPECIMENS (P < 0.001). BACTERIAL BIOFILM WAS VISUALIZED BOTH ON SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY AND FLUORESCENT IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION.Â¿ CYTOLOGICAL MARKERS ALK- AND CD30+ HAVE BEEN REPORTED. ACCORDING TO TABLE 1 Â¿CLINICAL SUMMARY OF BREAST IMPLANTÂ¿ASSOCIATED ALCL PATIENTS,Â¿ THERE WAS 1 CASE OF ALCL WHICH PRESENTED WITH BOTH EFFUSION AND TUMOR.
