404770|270334|D|1||PURE MEDICAL HEALTH PROBLEM CAUSED BY A DUBIOUS MEDICAL DEVICE WHICH MADE VICTIMS OF RPTRS FAMILY AND RPTR CHILDREN NEVER HAD A REAL PARENT SPOUSE NEVER A SPOUSE AFTER A CHRONIC BREAST INFECTION RPTR GOT BREAST IMPLANTS ADVISED SO THEY COULD AT LEAST WEAR A BRA RPTR REALLY LOVED THAT IDEA SURGEON TOLD RPTR WHEN YOU DIE AT SAY 80 YOUR BREASTS WILL BE STAYING STRAIGHT AHEAD NO BREAST PROBLEMS ANYMORE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IT TURNED OUT TO BE A GREAT DISASTER RPTR HAD 18 SURGERIES PROSTHESIS INOUT INOUT TRANSPLANTATION OF OWN TISSUE WITHOUT SUCCESS ANOTHER RECONSTRUCTION-TRY PROSTHESIS INOUT ETC WITHIN 3 YEARS RPTR GOT RHEUMATISM RA DIAGNOSED WAS FORCED TO MOVE INTO A SPECIAL HOUSE FOR DISABLED PEOPLE AND A LOT OF OTHER DISEASES WHICH DIDNT FIT THEM AT ALL THEIR BODY TOLD ANOTHER TALE SO EVERYTHING WAS ALL IN THEIR MIND IN 1990 A RUPTURED IMPLANT WAS REMOVED AND A VERY SAFE THICK ONE RE-IMPLANTED SPECIALIST ASSURED RPTR THAT THIS NEW DEVICE DIDNT CAUSE PROBLEMS RPTR RECOVERED COULD WALK WITHOUT PAIN MIRACLE ALAS ONLY FOR 2 MOS THE NEW LOW BLEED IMPLANT STARTED TO POISON RPTRS BODY AGAIN AND MADE THEM SICK AS NEVER BEFORE RPTR WAS COMPLETELY DISABLED AND HELPLESS THE ONLY WAY TO SURVIVE WAS A RADICAL EXPLANTATION OF THIS SICK-MAKER A VERY HARD DECISION DURING THAT TIME RPTR LAID HANDS ON AN INTERESTING MEDICAL REPORT PUBLICIZED IN 1987 ABOUT THE POSSIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN SILICONE AND IMMUNE DISORDERS LIKE RHEUMATISM NAMED HAD ILUMAN ADJUVANT DISEASE RPTR COULD NOT AND STILL CANNOT FIND WORDS TO EXPRESS THEIR FEELINGS OF ANGER AND BETRAYAL ALL THOSE LOST YEARS ALL THIS PAIN SCARS DESPAIR NOT ONLY FOR THEMSELF ALSO FOR THEIR SPOUSE AND CHILDREN BEFORE RPTR REALIZED IT THEY WERE THE HEAD OF A FAST GROWING SUPPORT GROUP FOR WOMEN WITH SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS OFFICIALLY REGISTERED BY LAW 5792 RPTRS BODY LOOKED AWFUL ONE BREAST WAS COMPLETELY GONE SINCE RPTR STARTED THEIR CRUSADE THEY HAVE HEARD THE VERY SAME STORY OVER 4000 TIMES THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR RPTR CONTACTED OTHER GROUPS AROUND THE WORLD ONLY THE TONGUE WAS DIFFERENT THE TALE THE VERY SAME RPTR ALSO WROTE OR PHONED TO DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES ALL OVER THE WORLD TO INFORM THEMSELF AS WELL AS POSSIBLE PLASTIC SURGEONS HARDLY INFORM THE WOMEN ABOUT POSSIBLE FUTURE HEALTH RISKS BOTH TO THEMSELVES AND THEIR YET UNBORN BABIES THEY ONLY SHOW NICE PICTURES SILICONE IS AN INERT MATERIAL NO DANGER AT ALL THE WORLDWIDE COMMOTION IS GOSSIP FROM HYSTERICAL WOMEN OUT FOR MONEY NOTHING SCIENTIFIC PROVEN NO LINK IS FOUND TILL NOW AS LONG AS IT ISNT BANNED I GO ON IS THEIR FAVORITE SLOGAN IT IS POSSIBLE HERE TO BUY YOUR BREASTS NOW AND PAY MONTHLY YOU CAN READ THAT IN ALL ADS IN ALL NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES I THINK THAT IS A VERY HYPOCRITICAL WAY TO TRANSLATE THE OATH OF HYPOCRATIS THE MAMMON ABOVE THE HUMAN BEINGS SINCE THE START OF SUPPORT GROUP IN 1992 TILL NOW RPTR HAS ANSWERED OVER 20000 TELEPHONE-CALLS FROM 5 MINS TO 1 12 HRS OR EVEN MORE AND HEARD MORE THAN 4000 TIMES THE VERY SAME STORY SOMETIMES ANONYMOUS THEY ALL RECEIVED INFORMATION-PACKET TO HELP THEM TO FIND THEIR WAY GROUP ALSO SENT THE WOMEN DIFFERENT QUESTIONNAIRES FOR MORE INVESTIGATION THE FIRST ONE WITH ABOUT 100 ANSWER POSSIBILITIES AGE OF THE WOMEN BETWEEN 17-78 YEARS AGE OF IMPLANTS ONE MONTH-35 YEARS THE RESULTS WERE SHOCKING BUT NOT SCIENTIFIC THAT CAME LATER THANKS TO THE UNIVERSITY WHO ANALYZED ALL RESULTS THE MOST SHOCKING PART THE ANSWERS FROM MOTHERS WITH CHILDREN BEFORE AND AFTER THEIR IMPLANTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE KIDS AND THEIR MEDICAL COMPLAINTS OVER 199 CHILDREN ARE REGISTERED FINDINGS WERE THE VERY SAME AS WRITTEN IN A CHILDREN HOSPITAL REPORT 1993 83 OF THE WOMEN WHO CONTACTED SUPPORT GROUP DID HAVE MANY OF THE WELL-KNOWN DISEASES THAT IS OVER 10 OF THE VALUED 30000 WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS IN RTPRS COUNTRY 14 WANTED INFO ABOUT AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION 2 DID NOT YET HAVE PROBLEMS 1 WAS SUFFERING DUE TO OTHER MEDICAL DEVICES LIKE

93 MOST OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS 1487 ALL DOCUMENTED SCORED HIGHER THAN 70 BY EXPLANATION OVER 80 OF THE IMPLANTS WERE RUPTURED OR VISIBLY LEAKINGBLEEDING THAT IS WHAT THE WOMEN TOLD RPTR BUT MOSTLY NOT WRITTEN IN THEIR FILES NOR REGISTERED 40 OF THE EXPLANTED WOMEN RECOVERED QUITE A LOT WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR ABOUT 45 NEEDED 2 TO 5 YEARS TO FEEL BETTER THE OTHERS ALAS HAVE PASSED THE WAY OF NO RETURN NO IDEA HOW LONG THEYLL STAY AMONG THEM 15-20 LADIES ARE TERRIBLY SICK GOING DOWN HILL DAILY SOME ARE TERMINAL BY NOW 7 TIMES THEY FOUND A TUMOR TOO LATE AS FAR AS RPTR HAS HEARD 16 LADIES ALREADY DIED WITHOUT KNOWING WHY FIVE OF THEM RPTR KNEW VERY WELL ALMOST TILL THE VERY LAST MINUTE ONE COMMITTED SUICIDE 34 YEARS OLD THEY COULD NOT STAND THE PAIN ANYMORE AND THEIR MAIMED BODY BUT MOST OF THE IMPLANTS WERE RUPTURED ENVELOPE GONE OR THERE WAS VISIBLE BLEEDING THERE ARE ALSO 2 BABIES RPTR KNOWS ABOUT ONE CHOKED IN MUCUS AFTER BEING BREASTFED ONLY 6 WEEKS OLD THE OTHER ONE BLED TO DEATH 2 WEEKS BEFORE BIRTH NO REASON FOUND ONLY A STRANGE DISORDER IN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM HEALTH GOVERNMENT DOESNT TAKE ALL COMPLAINTS SERIOUSLY THEY DONT REALIZE THE REALITY IS EVEN MORE THAN WORSE THEY HARDLY LISTEN TO RPTR THEY EVEN DONT BELIEVE RPTR AND DO NOTHING FOR THE SICK WOMEN CHILDREN AND MEN NO MEDICATION NO TREATMENT NO HELP AT ALL FOR THIS BETRAYED POPULATION RPTR THINKS ALL THEIR HEALTH
