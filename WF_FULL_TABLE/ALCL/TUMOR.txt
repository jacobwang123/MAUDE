IN 1975 I HAD DOW CORNING BREAST IMPLANTS PLACED IN MY BODY FOR COSMETIC REASONS. I WAS A HEALTHY 33 YEAR OLD WOMAN. AFTER BEING TOLD IMPLANTS WERE PERFECTLY SAFE AND THAT THEY WOULD LAST A LIFE TIME I WILLINGLY SIGNED UP FOR SURGERY. WITHIN THREE MONTHS I DEVELOPED HARD CAPSULES BILATERALLY. MY SURGEON ASSURED ME ALL WAS WELL, HOWEVER HE WOULD NEED TO PERFORM A CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY IN ORDER TO SOFTEN BOTH BREASTS. I RECALL BEING FEARFUL OF THIS PROCEDURE AS A) MY SURGEON MADE ME PROMISE ""NOT TO YELL"" AND B) THERE WOULD BE NO ANESTHESIA. PROCEDURE WAS INDEED VERY PAINFUL AS HE MANUALLY APPLIED PRESSURE TO EACH BREAST AND ""CRACKED"" THEM. I FELT A TEARING SENSATION AROUND EACH BREAST. THIS WAS FIRST OF NINE CLOSED CAPSULOTOMIES, AND I SUSPECT MY LEFT IMPLANT WAS RUPTURED FROM VERY FIRST ONE. ONE YEAR AFTER IMPLANTATION I BEGAN TO HAVE PAIN IN JOINTS OF MY RIGHT HAND AND A STRANGE RASH APPEARED ON MY CHEST AND ARMS. THREE YEARS LATER I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH THYROID CANCER. WHEN I COLLECTED ALL MY MEDICAL RECORDS OVER LAST FEW YEARS I FOUND MY BIOPSY WHICH REFERRED NOT ONLY TO MY MALIGNANT TUMOR, BUT ALSO TO ""YELLOW GELATINOUS MATERIAL"" SURROUNDING MY THYROID GLAND. EVEN THOUGH MY MEDICAL RECORDS CLEARLY STATED I HAD HAD A BREAST AUGMENTATION, NO ONE AT TIME OF SURGERY MENTIONED PRESENCE OF A FOREIGN BODY MATERIAL FOUND IN MY GLAND. MY TUMOR WAS REMOVED YET AN OBVIOUSLY RUPTURED IMPLANT WAS ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN MY BODY FOR SEVERAL MORE YEARS. IT IS KNOWN THAT MOST OF MEDICAL COMMUNITY REFUSES TO ADMIT ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS AND DISEASE; HOWEVER, GIVEN THE PRESENCE OF SILICA THOUGHOUT MY THYROID GLAND AND LYMPH NODES THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND AS TO WHAT CAUSED MY CANCER. SIX YEARS AFTER IMPLANTATION MY RASH CONTINUED TO SPREAD, MY JOINTS ACHED AND MY LEFT BREAST BECAME PAINFUL AND ""HOT"" FEELING. MY LEFT NIPPLE ALSO TURNED A DARKER COLOR THAN OTHER ONE. I FELT FATIGUED, AND DISORIENTATED MOST OF TIME. I CONTINUED TO SEEK MEDICAL CARE AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS NO EXPLANATION FOR MY BODY RASH. MY PHYSICIANS COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR MY SLOW RECOVERY FROM THYROID CANCER AND ALL RELATED TREATMENTS I ENDURED. DUE TO PAIN AND CONTINUED HARDENING OF MY LEFT BREAST MY SURGEON DECIDED TO REPLACE THIS IMPLANT WITH ANOTHER DOW CORNING UNIT. AFTER SURGERY HE DID NOT TELL ME THAT EXPLANTED IMPLANT WAS RUPTURED (I LEARNED ABOUT RUPTURE WHEN COLLECTING ALL MY DATA THREE YEARS AGO). TWELVE YEARS AFTER IMPLANTATION I BEGAN TO HAVE TREMORS IN MY LEFT HAND, CHRONIC GASTRITIS, JOINT ACHE AND A ""PINS AND NEEDLES"" SENSATION IN MY LEGS AND ARMS. AT TIMES I IMAGINED SPIDERS WERE CRAWLING ON MY LEGS. FROM THIS POINT MY HEALTH WENT INTO A DOWNWARD SPIRAL AND I BECAME MORE DEPRESSED AS EACH DOCTOR'S APPT SUGGESTED SAME METHOD OF TREATMENT... SEEK MENTAL THERAPY. BY 1994, AFTER 19 YEARS OF IMPLANTS, MY HEALTH HIT ROCK BOTTOM. I WAS FATIGUED BEYOND POINT OF RECOVERY, NERVOUS, DEPRESSED AND, YES, SUICIDAL. MY BODY WOULD REACT TO SLIGHTEST STIMULANT AND I WAS HAVING SEVERE MEMORY LOSS, AND I BECAME DYSLEXIC. AT ONE POINT I WENT TO OUR LOCAL MARKET, LESS THAN A MILE FROM HOME, AND I COULDN'T REMEMBER HOW TO DRIVE HOME. I BEGAN TO LOSE MY BALANCE AND I HAD DISTORTED VISION. EVEN TODAY ONE OF MY PUPILS DOES NOT DILATE NORMALLY. I RETURNED MANY TIMES TO TRY TO FIND A CURE FOR MY RACING HEARTBEAT, MY RASH, STIFFNESS AND PAIN IN MY LIMBS, TREMOR IN MY HAND, EYE AND VAGINAL DRYNESS. AGAIN I WAS TOLD TO SEEK COUNSELING. OVER THIS PERIOD MY MARRIAGE FAILED AND I BEGAN TO THINK I WAS REALLY CRAZY. I CONSIDERED TAKING MY LIFE MANY TIMES. BY 1994 I WAS FALLING INTO A DEEP HOLE. AFTER A NEAR HEAD ON COLLISION BECAUSE I WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY DISCERNING LEFT FROM RIGHT I BEGAN TO FEAR DRIVING. MY LIFE WAS OUT OF CONTROL. AS A RESULT OF ALL MEDIA COVERAGE AROUND 1994 ON BREAST IMPLANTS I RETURNED TO MY PLASTIC SURGEON. HE TOLD ME THERE COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN MY ""IMAGINED SYMPTOMS"" AND BREAST IMPLANTS. HE DID, HOWEVER, CONCEDE THAT MY IMPLANTS ""LOOKED TERRIBLE"" DUE TO EVER PRESENT CAPSULES. HE RELUCTANTLY AGREED TO REMOVE MY IMPLANTS ON MAY 4, 1994. OF COURSE IT WAS SUGGESTED I REPLACE THEM WITH SALINE IMPLANTS WHICH I DECLINED. ONE MONTH AFTER EXPLANTATION I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BRAIN LESIONS WHICH EXPLAINS MY DIAGNOSES OF ATYPICAL MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. FOR SIX MONTHS MY SYMPTOMS SEEM TO INTENSIFY AND THEN I BEGAN TO SLOWLY IMPROVE. TODAY I LIVE WITH DISCOMFORT AND PAIN OF STIFF LEGS AND SENSATION OF SPIDERS ON MY SKIN IS STILL WITH ME. CLIMATE EXTREMES MAKES PAIN IN MY LEGS UNBEARABLE. MY MEMORY HAS IMPROVED AND I NO LONGER SUFFER, OR CAUSE OTHERS TO SUFFER, THOSE HORRIBLE AND UNPREDICTABLE MOOD SWINGS. MY CANCER IS IN REMISSION AND I AM ON MEDICATION FOR REST OF MY LIFE. MY RASH, IT APPEARS, IS WITH ME FOR LIFE. EVEN THOUGH I'VE HAD SOME IMPROVEMENT MY HEALTH HAS BEEN PERMANENTLY DAMAGED BY BREAST IMPLANTS. WHAT HAS ALL THIS MEANT TO ME? I AM ANGRY TO HAVE LOST 19 YEARS OF MY LIFE TO AVARICE AND DECEPTION OF DOW CORNING. I MOURN LOSS OF MY FIRST MARRIAGE AND I CAN'T HELP WONDERING WHAT LONG TERM HEALTH RISKS ARE FOR ME AND MY FELLOW SURVIVORS. WOULD I HAVE CONSENTED TO BREAST IMPLANTS HAD I BEEN TOLD OF CONSEQUENCES OR GIVEN CONSIDERATION OF READING MANY NEGATIVE TEST RESULTS DOW CORNING HAD AVAILABLE AS EARLY AS 1975? ABSOLUTELY NOT! I WILL DO ALL THAT IS POSSIBLE TO DISCOURAGE YOUNGER WOMEN FROM PURSUING IMPLANTS BE THEY SALINE, SOY, OR WHATEVER ELSE SOME MISGUIDED SCIENTIST DREAMS UP.

RPTR WAS PUT THROUGH A SERIES OF LAB TESTS, X-RAYS, ULTRASOUNDS, ETC. THE RESULTS OF ALL OF THESE TESTS WERE MAINLY NEGATIVE. HOWEVER, A FIBROID TUMOR WAS THOUGHT TO BE THE PROBLEM. AS RPTR WAS ALSO GOING THROUGH MENOPAUSE, THE DRS AND RPTR THOUGHT THE PROBLEMS WERE RELATED TO HORMONAL CHANGES. IN 1993, RPTR HAD UNDERGONE A HYSTERECTOMY AND GALL BLADDER REMOVAL. SHE NEVER FELT ANY BETTER. THEN IN EARLY 3/94, AFTER HER HUSBAND AND DR ENCOURAGED HER TO KEEP TRACK OF HER ACTIVITIES, SHE DISCOVERED THAT SEX WOULD SET OFF AN ATTACK. LIKEWISE, WEATHER CHANGES, ANY KIND OF STRESS (BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE), EXERCISE, GARDENING, VIGOROUS WALKING, ETC, CERTAIN FOODS, AND EVEN A MASSAGE APPEARED TO EXACERBATE THE SYMPTOMS. ACTING ON THIS DISCOVERY, SHE CONSULTED AN ENDOCRINOLOGIST WHO SPECIALIZES IN AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS AND 2 GYNECOLOGISTS ALL OF WHOM RECOMMENDED THAT RPTR SEES A PLASTIC SURGEON WHO IN TURN ORDERED AN ULTRASOUND OF THE BREASTS. THE ULTRASOUND REVEALED FINDINGS SUGGESTIVE OF ""IMPLANT RUPTURE WITH EARLY GRANULOMA FORMATION."""|SILASTIC GEL BREAST IMPLANT, 235 CC|974|05/17/1994|B|||*||13300.0|*|FTR|1.0||nan|Y|H069556|||MIDLAND|US|DOW CORNING CORP.||MI|48686||||True

404770|270334|D|1||"PURE MEDICAL HEALTH PROBLEM, CAUSED BY A DUBIOUS MEDICAL DEVICE, WHICH MADE VICTIMS OF RPTR'S FAMILY AND RPTR. CHILDREN NEVER HAD A REAL PARENT, SPOUSE NEVER A SPOUSE. AFTER A CHRONIC BREAST INFECTION, RPTR GOT BREAST IMPLANTS ADVISED. SO, THEY COULD ""AT LEAST"" WEAR A BRA. RPTR REALLY LOVED THAT IDEA. SURGEON TOLD RPTR: ""WHEN YOU DIE AT, SAY 80, YOUR BREASTS WILL BE STAYING STRAIGHT AHEAD. NO BREAST PROBLEMS ANYMORE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE"". IT TURNED OUT TO BE A GREAT DISASTER. RPTR HAD 18 SURGERIES. PROSTHESIS IN/OUT, IN/OUT, TRANSPLANTATION OF OWN TISSUE (WITHOUT SUCCESS), ANOTHER RECONSTRUCTION-TRY, PROSTHESIS IN/OUT, ETC. WITHIN 3 YEARS, RPTR GOT RHEUMATISM (R.A.) DIAGNOSED (WAS FORCED TO MOVE INTO A SPECIAL HOUSE FOR DISABLED PEOPLE) AND A LOT OF OTHER DISEASES WHICH DIDN'T FIT THEM AT ALL. THEIR BODY TOLD ANOTHER TALE, SO EVERYTHING WAS ALL IN THEIR MIND. IN 1990 A RUPTURED IMPLANT WAS REMOVED AND A ""VERY SAFE"" THICK ONE RE-IMPLANTED. SPECIALIST ASSURED RPTR THAT THIS NEW DEVICE DIDN'T CAUSE PROBLEMS. RPTR RECOVERED, COULD WALK WITHOUT PAIN (MIRACLE). ALAS ONLY FOR 2 MOS. THE NEW (LOW BLEED) IMPLANT STARTED TO POISON RPTR'S BODY AGAIN AND MADE THEM SICK AS NEVER BEFORE. RPTR WAS COMPLETELY DISABLED AND HELPLESS. THE ONLY WAY TO SURVIVE WAS A RADICAL EXPLANTATION OF THIS SICK-MAKER, A VERY HARD DECISION. DURING THAT TIME RPTR LAID HANDS ON AN INTERESTING MEDICAL REPORT (PUBLICIZED IN 1987) ABOUT THE POSSIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN SILICONE AND IMMUNE DISORDERS LIKE RHEUMATISM, NAMED H.A.D., ILUMAN ADJUVANT DISEASE. RPTR COULD NOT AND STILL CANNOT FIND WORDS TO EXPRESS THEIR FEELINGS OF ANGER AND BETRAYAL. ALL THOSE LOST YEARS. ALL THIS PAIN, SCARS, DESPAIR. NOT ONLY FOR THEMSELF, ALSO FOR THEIR SPOUSE AND CHILDREN. BEFORE RPTR REALIZED IT THEY WERE THE ""HEAD OF A FAST GROWING SUPPORT GROUP FOR WOMEN WITH SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS, OFFICIALLY REGISTERED BY LAW 5/7/92. RPTR'S BODY LOOKED AWFUL; ONE BREAST WAS COMPLETELY GONE. SINCE RPTR STARTED THEIR CRUSADE THEY HAVE HEARD THE VERY SAME STORY OVER 4,000 TIMES. THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR RPTR. CONTACTED OTHER GROUPS AROUND THE WORLD, ONLY ""THE TONGUE"" WAS DIFFERENT, THE TALE THE VERY SAME. RPTR ALSO WROTE OR PHONED TO DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES ALL OVER THE WORLD TO INFORM THEMSELF AS WELL AS POSSIBLE. PLASTIC SURGEONS HARDLY INFORM THE WOMEN ABOUT POSSIBLE FUTURE HEALTH RISKS BOTH TO THEMSELVES AND THEIR YET UNBORN BABIES. THEY ONLY SHOW NICE PICTURES. ""SILICONE IS AN INERT MATERIAL, NO DANGER AT ALL! THE WORLDWIDE COMMOTION IS GOSSIP FROM HYSTERICAL WOMEN, OUT FOR MONEY. NOTHING SCIENTIFIC PROVEN, NO LINK IS FOUND TILL NOW, AS LONG AS IT ISN'T BANNED I GO ON!"", IS THEIR FAVORITE SLOGAN, IT IS POSSIBLE HERE TO BUY YOUR BREASTS NOW AND PAY MONTHLY, YOU CAN READ THAT IN ALL ADS IN ALL NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES. I THINK THAT IS A VERY HYPOCRITICAL WAY TO TRANSLATE THE OATH OF HYPOCRATIS, THE MAMMON ABOVE THE HUMAN BEINGS. SINCE THE START OF SUPPORT GROUP IN 1992 TILL NOW RPTR HAS ANSWERED OVER 20,000 TELEPHONE-CALLS (FROM 5 MINS TO 1 1/2 HRS OR EVEN MORE) AND HEARD MORE THAN 4,000 TIMES THE VERY SAME STORY, SOMETIMES ANONYMOUS. THEY ALL RECEIVED INFORMATION-PACKET TO HELP THEM TO FIND THEIR WAY. GROUP ALSO SENT THE WOMEN DIFFERENT QUESTIONNAIRES FOR MORE INVESTIGATION. THE FIRST ONE WITH ABOUT 100 ANSWER POSSIBILITIES. AGE OF THE WOMEN BETWEEN 17-78 YEARS. AGE OF IMPLANTS: ONE MONTH-35 YEARS. THE RESULTS WERE SHOCKING, BUT NOT SCIENTIFIC, THAT CAME LATER THANKS TO THE UNIVERSITY WHO ANALYZED ALL RESULTS. THE MOST SHOCKING PART, THE ANSWERS FROM MOTHERS WITH CHILDREN BEFORE AND AFTER THEIR IMPLANTS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE KIDS AND THEIR MEDICAL COMPLAINTS. OVER 199 CHILDREN ARE REGISTERED. FINDINGS WERE THE VERY SAME AS WRITTEN IN A CHILDREN HOSPITAL REPORT (1993). 83% OF THE WOMEN WHO CONTACTED SUPPORT GROUP DID HAVE MANY OF THE WELL-KNOWN DISEASES. THAT IS OVER 10% OF THE VALUED 30,000 WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS IN RTPR'S COUNTRY. 14% WANTED INFO ABOUT AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION. 2% DID NOT (YET) HAVE PROBLEMS. 1% WAS SUFFERING DUE TO OTHER MEDICAL DEVICES LIKE HIPS, TESTICLES, INJECTIONS, NEEDLES, ETC.

MOST OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS (1487, ALL DOCUMENTED) SCORED HIGHER THAN 70%. BY EXPLANATION OVER 80% OF THE IMPLANTS WERE RUPTURED OR VISIBLY LEAKING/BLEEDING. THAT IS WHAT THE WOMEN TOLD RPTR, BUT MOSTLY NOT WRITTEN IN THEIR FILES NOR REGISTERED. 40% OF THE EXPLANTED WOMEN RECOVERED QUITE A LOT WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR. ABOUT 45% NEEDED 2 TO 5 YEARS TO FEEL BETTER. THE OTHERS, ALAS, HAVE PASSED THE WAY OF NO RETURN. NO IDEA HOW LONG THEY'LL STAY AMONG THEM. 15-20 LADIES ARE TERRIBLY SICK, GOING DOWN HILL DAILY, SOME ARE TERMINAL BY NOW. 7 TIMES THEY FOUND A TUMOR TOO LATE (AS FAR AS RPTR HAS HEARD). 16 LADIES ALREADY DIED, WITHOUT KNOWING WHY. FIVE OF THEM RPTR KNEW VERY WELL, ALMOST TILL THE VERY LAST MINUTE. ONE COMMITTED SUICIDE, 34 YEARS OLD. THEY COULD NOT STAND THE PAIN ANYMORE AND THEIR MAIMED BODY. BUT MOST OF THE IMPLANTS WERE RUPTURED (ENVELOPE GONE) OR THERE WAS VISIBLE BLEEDING. THERE ARE ALSO 2 BABIES RPTR KNOWS ABOUT. ONE CHOKED IN MUCUS AFTER BEING BREASTFED, ONLY 6 WEEKS OLD. THE OTHER ONE BLED TO DEATH, 2 WEEKS BEFORE BIRTH. NO REASON FOUND. ONLY A STRANGE DISORDER IN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. HEALTH GOVERNMENT DOESN'T TAKE ALL COMPLAINTS SERIOUSLY; THEY DON'T REALIZE THE REALITY IS EVEN MORE THAN WORSE. THEY HARDLY LISTEN TO RPTR. THEY EVEN DON'T BELIEVE RPTR AND DO NOTHING FOR THE SICK WOMEN, CHILDREN AND MEN. NO MEDICATION, NO TREATMENT, NO HELP AT ALL FOR THIS BETRAYED POPULATION. RPTR THINKS ALL THEIR HEALTH MINISTERS ARE RESPONSIBLE. THEY ALLOW DUBIOUS MEDICAL DEVICES ON THE MARKETS; THE VERY SAME DEVICE THAT IS BANNED IN AMERICA AND OTHER COUNTRIES SINCE 1992."|SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT|NI|07/10/2002|*|||*||393767.0|*|FTR|1.0||LOW BLEED SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT|Y|NI|UNK||UNK|*|UNK|||||NI|NI|True

1994935|1714232|D|1||I HAD A BREAST LIFT WITH AUGMENTATION ON (B)(6) 2009 WITH INAMED STYLE 68MP SALINE IMPLANTS. I BEGAN A LONG LIST OF DETERIORATING MEDICAL PROBLEMS BEGINNING BY THE SECOND WEEK OF (B)(6) IN 2009. THEY DID NOT START GETTING BETTER UNTIL HAVING THE IMPLANTS AND CAPSULECTOMY IN (B)(6) OF 2010. I WAS ALWAYS EXTREMELY HEALTHY BEFORE AND HAD NO PREVIOUS MEDICAL PROBLEMS PRIOR TO THIS EVENT. THE FIRST SYMPTOMS IN (B)(6) 2009 WAS SHORTNESS OF BREATH, NO COUGH. I SAW A PCP WHO COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING AND SUGGESTED THAT I TAKE PREVACID (NEVER HAD REFLUX SYMPTOMS) TO SEE IF IT WOULD HELP. WITHIN A DAY, I HAD TO BE TAKEN TO THE ER FOR SHORTNESS OF BREATH. AFTER CHEST X-RAYS, BLOOD OXYGEN CHECK, AND BLOOD WORK TO RULE OUT A CLOT, I WAS SENT HOME AND TOLD TO TAKE ADVAIR AND THE PREVACID TO SEE IF IT HELPS. THE ADVAIR BEGAN HELPING ME AND BECAME A CRUTCH THAT I NEEDED OFF AN ON FOR THE ENTIRE TIME WHILE I HAD IMPLANTS. THIS WAS AN ATYPICAL ASTHMA, AS THE WHEEZING WAS NOT OFTEN HEARD. I HAD SHORTNESS OF BREATH, FREQUENT COUGHING, AND SPIT UP HEAVY SPUTUM MULTIPLE TIMES PER DAY. THE SPUTUM CONTINUED EVEN WHEN THE ADVAIR HELPED THE BREATHING. I ALSO BEGAN TO HAVE MEMORY LOSS AND BRAIN FOG. SHORT TERM MEMORY BECAME AN ISSUE. I BEGAN HAVING EPISODES OF HUGE SWOLLEN, SORE LYMPH NODES IN MY LEGS AND GROIN THAT WOULD LAST ONE TO TWO WEEKS AT A TIME. I HAD INFLAMMATORY NODULES ON THE SKIN OF MY HANDS. I HAD CONSTANT ABDOMINAL BLOATING AND GAS. I STARTED HAVING EXTENSIVE BLEEDING FROM THE LOWER GI TRACT IN (B)(6) OF 2009. I HAD FREQUENT HEADACHES, STOMACH ACHES, AND NAUSEA. I EXPERIENCED EXTREME FATIGUE. I HAD DIFFICULTY TALKING, STUTTERING, WRITING BECAME A CHALLENGE. I OFTEN COULD NOT SPELL THE WORDS THAT I HAD KNOWN HOW TO SPELL FOR YEARS AND WOULD GET LOST DRIVING IN AREAS I HAD BEEN FAMILIAR WITH FOR YEARS. I HAD OVARIAN CYSTS WITH PELVIC PAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE AND HORMONE IMBALANCE. MOST OF THESE SYMPTOMS WERE COMING ON BY THE (B)(6) OF 2009. THEY GRADUALLY WORSENED. THE ONLY THING THAT SEEMED TO HELP ME BE LESS DEPENDANT ON THE INHALERS WAS NAET NATURAL ALLERGY TREATMENTS FOR SILICONE AND MOLD. I ALSO FOUND GOOD IMPROVEMENTS FROM USING A SILICONE DETOX BATH SEVERAL DAYS PER WEEK AND NUMEROUS NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS TO ADDRESS THE BIOFILM AROUND THE IMPLANTS AS WELL AS DETOXING THE SILICONE. BY THAT TIME, I WAS SUSPECTING THE IMPLANTS HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS. I CONTINUED TO AVIDLY RESEARCH BECAUSE ALL OF THE MEDICAL SPECIALISTS SEEMED TO BE COMPLETELY UNAWARE OF ANY CONNECTIONS. THERE IS A TRUE SYNDROME THAT CAN OCCUR FROM BREAST IMPLANTS THAT INVOLVES THE BIOFILM AROUND SALINE IMPLANTS. THE PROBLEM IS THAT ALL OF MY DISORDERS WERE NON-DESCRIPT. IT LOOKED ON THE SURFACE AS IF I WAS SUFFERING FROM LUPUS, SCLERODERMA, CELIAC, ASTHMA, AND ALZHEIMER'S. HOWEVER, A WOMAN WITH IMPLANT DISORDER DOES NOT HAVE ALL THE SIGNS OF EACH OF THOSE ILLNESSES TO BE DIAGNOSED. I AM A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER MYSELF AND I KNEW THAT SOMETHING BIG WAS WRONG. WHEN I DECIDED TO HAVE THE IMPLANTS AND CAPSULE REMOVED, I HAD A BREAST ULTRASOUND PER MY SURGEON PRE-SURGERY. THEY ALSO FOUND A BENIGN TUMOR DEEP IN MY RIGHT BREAST THAT COINCIDENTALLY WAS ALSO RIGHT ABOVE THE IMPLANT. A BIOPSY WAS ADDED ON TO MY SURGERY. I FOUND HUGE HEALTH CHANGES IMMEDIATELY WITH THE SURGERY, AND WHILE I AM CONTINUING TO RECOVER AND DETOXIFY THE EFFECT OF SILICONE AND MOLD (ASSOCIATED WITH SALINE IMPLANTS) ON MY BODY, I AM MAKING PROGRESS SO QUICKLY.

1994935|1714232|D|1||I HAD A BREAST LIFT WITH AUGMENTATION ON (B)(6) 2009 WITH INAMED STYLE 68MP SALINE IMPLANTS. I BEGAN A LONG LIST OF DETERIORATING MEDICAL PROBLEMS BEGINNING BY THE SECOND WEEK OF (B)(6) IN 2009. THEY DID NOT START GETTING BETTER UNTIL HAVING THE IMPLANTS AND CAPSULECTOMY IN (B)(6) OF 2010. I WAS ALWAYS EXTREMELY HEALTHY BEFORE AND HAD NO PREVIOUS MEDICAL PROBLEMS PRIOR TO THIS EVENT. THE FIRST SYMPTOMS IN (B)(6) 2009 WAS SHORTNESS OF BREATH, NO COUGH. I SAW A PCP WHO COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING AND SUGGESTED THAT I TAKE PREVACID (NEVER HAD REFLUX SYMPTOMS) TO SEE IF IT WOULD HELP. WITHIN A DAY, I HAD TO BE TAKEN TO THE ER FOR SHORTNESS OF BREATH. AFTER CHEST X-RAYS, BLOOD OXYGEN CHECK, AND BLOOD WORK TO RULE OUT A CLOT, I WAS SENT HOME AND TOLD TO TAKE ADVAIR AND THE PREVACID TO SEE IF IT HELPS. THE ADVAIR BEGAN HELPING ME AND BECAME A CRUTCH THAT I NEEDED OFF AN ON FOR THE ENTIRE TIME WHILE I HAD IMPLANTS. THIS WAS AN ATYPICAL ASTHMA, AS THE WHEEZING WAS NOT OFTEN HEARD. I HAD SHORTNESS OF BREATH, FREQUENT COUGHING, AND SPIT UP HEAVY SPUTUM MULTIPLE TIMES PER DAY. THE SPUTUM CONTINUED EVEN WHEN THE ADVAIR HELPED THE BREATHING. I ALSO BEGAN TO HAVE MEMORY LOSS AND BRAIN FOG. SHORT TERM MEMORY BECAME AN ISSUE. I BEGAN HAVING EPISODES OF HUGE SWOLLEN, SORE LYMPH NODES IN MY LEGS AND GROIN THAT WOULD LAST ONE TO TWO WEEKS AT A TIME. I HAD INFLAMMATORY NODULES ON THE SKIN OF MY HANDS. I HAD CONSTANT ABDOMINAL BLOATING AND GAS. I STARTED HAVING EXTENSIVE BLEEDING FROM THE LOWER GI TRACT IN (B)(6) OF 2009. I HAD FREQUENT HEADACHES, STOMACH ACHES, AND NAUSEA. I EXPERIENCED EXTREME FATIGUE. I HAD DIFFICULTY TALKING, STUTTERING, WRITING BECAME A CHALLENGE. I OFTEN COULD NOT SPELL THE WORDS THAT I HAD KNOWN HOW TO SPELL FOR YEARS AND WOULD GET LOST DRIVING IN AREAS I HAD BEEN FAMILIAR WITH FOR YEARS. I HAD OVARIAN CYSTS WITH PELVIC PAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE AND HORMONE IMBALANCE. MOST OF THESE SYMPTOMS WERE COMING ON BY THE (B)(6) OF 2009. THEY GRADUALLY WORSENED. THE ONLY THING THAT SEEMED TO HELP ME BE LESS DEPENDANT ON THE INHALERS WAS NAET NATURAL ALLERGY TREATMENTS FOR SILICONE AND MOLD. I ALSO FOUND GOOD IMPROVEMENTS FROM USING A SILICONE DETOX BATH SEVERAL DAYS PER WEEK AND NUMEROUS NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS TO ADDRESS THE BIOFILM AROUND THE IMPLANTS AS WELL AS DETOXING THE SILICONE. BY THAT TIME, I WAS SUSPECTING THE IMPLANTS HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS. I CONTINUED TO AVIDLY RESEARCH BECAUSE ALL OF THE MEDICAL SPECIALISTS SEEMED TO BE COMPLETELY UNAWARE OF ANY CONNECTIONS. THERE IS A TRUE SYNDROME THAT CAN OCCUR FROM BREAST IMPLANTS THAT INVOLVES THE BIOFILM AROUND SALINE IMPLANTS. THE PROBLEM IS THAT ALL OF MY DISORDERS WERE NON-DESCRIPT. IT LOOKED ON THE SURFACE AS IF I WAS SUFFERING FROM LUPUS, SCLERODERMA, CELIAC, ASTHMA, AND ALZHEIMER'S. HOWEVER, A WOMAN WITH IMPLANT DISORDER DOES NOT HAVE ALL THE SIGNS OF EACH OF THOSE ILLNESSES TO BE DIAGNOSED. I AM A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER MYSELF AND I KNEW THAT SOMETHING BIG WAS WRONG. WHEN I DECIDED TO HAVE THE IMPLANTS AND CAPSULE REMOVED, I HAD A BREAST ULTRASOUND PER MY SURGEON PRE-SURGERY. THEY ALSO FOUND A BENIGN TUMOR DEEP IN MY RIGHT BREAST THAT COINCIDENTALLY WAS ALSO RIGHT ABOVE THE IMPLANT. A BIOPSY WAS ADDED ON TO MY SURGERY. I FOUND HUGE HEALTH CHANGES IMMEDIATELY WITH THE SURGERY, AND WHILE I AM CONTINUING TO RECOVER AND DETOXIFY THE EFFECT OF SILICONE AND MOLD (ASSOCIATED WITH SALINE IMPLANTS) ON MY BODY, I AM MAKING PROGRESS SO QUICKLY. OTHER WOMEN SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE HEALTH RISKS BEFORE GETTING THESE IMPLANTS.

I AGREED TO HAVE AN IMPLANT PUT IN AT THE SAME TIME AS MY SURGERY. THE PLASTIC SURGEON PUT IN A TISSUE EXPANDER FOR THREE MONTHS AND ON (B)(6) 2011, I HAD AN ALLERGAN TEXTURED BREAST IMPLANT PUT IN. THE STYLE OF THE IMPLANT HAD NOT BEEN APPROVED BY THE FDA YET, SO I SIGNED A CONSENT FORM TO BE PART OF A STUDY. I READ THE AGREEMENT THOROUGHLY AND THERE WERE ONLY TWO POSSIBLE RISKS: INFECTION OR COMPARTMENT CONTRACTURE. THERE WAS NO MENTION OF LYMPHOMA CANCER. APPROXIMATELY 2 YEARS LATER THE FDA APPROVED THIS STYLE IMPLANT AND THE STUDY WAS ENDED. ON (B)(6) 2016 MY RIGHT BREAST BECAME TIGHT AND HARD. IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS IT BECAME LARGER AND LARGER. I CONTACTED MY PLASTIC SURGEON AND SHE ASKED ME TO TAKE A PICTURE OF MY BREAST AND SEND TO HER, SINCE I WAS OUT OF TOWN AT THE TIME. SHE ORDERED AN ANTIBIOTIC AND MADE AN APPOINTMENT FOR ME TO SEE HER THE FOLLOWING WEEK. I WENT TO SEE HER AND SHE TOOK MORE PICTURES AND TOLD ME IT WAS PROBABLY AN INFECTION AND I SHOULD CONTINUE ANTIBIOTIC. MY BREAST GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER AND MY SURGEON DECIDED TO REMOVE MY IMPLANT. DURING THE SURGERY SHE TOOK A TISSUE SAMPLE AND THEN PUT IN A NEW TEXTURED IMPLANT AND CLOSED UP INCISION. ON (B)(6), THE PATHOLOGY REPORT CAME BACK WITH THE DIAGNOSIS OF ALCL. IT WAS CONFIRMED BY A PET CT SCAN. MY SURGEON SAID THAT SHE KNEW THE DOCTOR WHO SPECIALIZED IN ALCL AND THAT HE WAS AT THE (B)(6). MY HUSBAND AND I FLEW TO (B)(6) TO HAVE IMPLANT AND SURROUNDING SCAR TISSUE REMOVED BY THE SURGEONS WHO ARE THE AUTHORITY ON THIS DISEASE. ALSO, THE RESEARCH ON THIS DISEASE IS BEING DONE BY A TEAM THERE. THEY HAVE SEEN MOST OF THE DIAGNOSED CASES IN THE US. I HAD OTHER TESTS DONE THERE: AN ULTRASOUND AND A CHEST X-RAY. I SPOKE WITH THE DOCTOR AND HE TOLD ME THAT THE LYMPHOMA WAS ONLY IN THE FLUID SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT AND NOT IN THE SCAR TISSUE (CAPSULE) OR IN MY LYMPH NODES. I HAD THE SURGERY ON (B)(6) 2016 AND WAS INFORMED THAT ALL OF THE CANCER CELLS WERE REMOVED AND I WAS NOW CANCER FREE. I DECIDED TO HAVE A SMOOTH SILICONE IMPLANT PUT IN DURING THE SURGERY RATHER THAN COME BACK LATER FOR ADDITIONAL RECONSTRUCTION. THE DOCTOR TOLD ME THAT NONE OF THE ALCL CASES HAD EVER INVOLVED A SMOOTH IMPLANT.
