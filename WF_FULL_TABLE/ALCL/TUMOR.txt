20734|145100|D|1||"RPTR WRITES, ""I AM CANCER AND SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT SURVIVOR AND I FEEL MY HISTORY MAY BE OF SOME INTEREST TO YOU. IN 1975 I HAD DOW CORNING BREAST IMPLANTS PLACED IN MY BODY FOR COSMETIC REASONS. I WAS A HEALTHY 33 YEAR OLD WOMAN. AFTER BEING TOLD IMPLANTS WERE PERFECTLY SAFE AND THAT THEY WOULD LAST A LIFE TIME I WILLINGLY SIGNED UP FOR SURGERY. WITHIN THREE MONTHS I DEVELOPED HARD CAPSULES BILATERALLY. MY SURGEON ASSURED ME ALL WAS WELL, HOWEVER HE WOULD NEED TO PERFORM A CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY IN ORDER TO SOFTEN BOTH BREASTS. I RECALL BEING FEARFUL OF THIS PROCEDURE AS A) MY SURGEON MADE ME PROMISE ""NOT TO YELL"" AND B) THERE WOULD BE NO ANESTHESIA. PROCEDURE WAS INDEED VERY PAINFUL AS HE MANUALLY APPLIED PRESSURE TO EACH BREAST AND ""CRACKED"" THEM. I FELT A TEARING SENSATION AROUND EACH BREAST. THIS WAS FIRST OF NINE CLOSED CAPSULOTOMIES, AND I SUSPECT MY LEFT IMPLANT WAS RUPTURED FROM VERY FIRST ONE. ONE YEAR AFTER IMPLANTATION I BEGAN TO HAVE PAIN IN JOINTS OF MY RIGHT HAND AND A STRANGE RASH APPEARED ON MY CHEST AND ARMS. THREE YEARS LATER I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH THYROID CANCER. WHEN I COLLECTED ALL MY MEDICAL RECORDS OVER LAST FEW YEARS I FOUND MY BIOPSY WHICH REFERRED NOT ONLY TO MY MALIGNANT TUMOR, BUT ALSO TO ""YELLOW GELATINOUS MATERIAL"" SURROUNDING MY THYROID GLAND. EVEN THOUGH MY MEDICAL RECORDS CLEARLY STATED I HAD HAD A BREAST AUGMENTATION, NO ONE AT TIME OF SURGERY MENTIONED PRESENCE OF A FOREIGN BODY MATERIAL FOUND IN MY GLAND. MY TUMOR WAS REMOVED YET AN OBVIOUSLY RUPTURED IMPLANT WAS ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN MY BODY FOR SEVERAL MORE YEARS. IT IS KNOWN THAT MOST OF MEDICAL COMMUNITY REFUSES TO ADMIT ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS AND DISEASE; HOWEVER, GIVEN THE PRESENCE OF SILICA THOUGHOUT MY THYROID GLAND AND LYMPH NODES THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND AS TO WHAT CAUSED MY CANCER. SIX YEARS AFTER IMPLANTATION MY RASH CONTINUED TO SPREAD, MY JOINTS ACHED AND MY LEFT BREAST BECAME PAINFUL AND ""HOT"" FEELING. MY LEFT NIPPLE ALSO TURNED A DARKER COLOR THAN OTHER ONE. I FELT FATIGUED, AND DISORIENTATED MOST OF TIME. I CONTINUED TO SEEK MEDICAL CARE AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS NO EXPLANATION FOR MY BODY RASH. MY PHYSICIANS COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR MY SLOW RECOVERY FROM THYROID CANCER AND ALL RELATED TREATMENTS I ENDURED. DUE TO PAIN AND CONTINUED HARDENING OF MY LEFT BREAST MY SURGEON DECIDED TO REPLACE THIS IMPLANT WITH ANOTHER DOW CORNING UNIT. AFTER SURGERY HE DID NOT TELL ME THAT EXPLANTED IMPLANT WAS RUPTURED (I LEARNED ABOUT RUPTURE WHEN COLLECTING ALL MY DATA THREE YEARS AGO). TWELVE YEARS AFTER IMPLANTATION I BEGAN TO HAVE TREMORS IN MY LEFT HAND, CHRONIC GASTRITIS, JOINT ACHE AND A ""PINS AND NEEDLES"" SENSATION IN MY LEGS AND ARMS. AT TIMES I IMAGINED SPIDERS WERE CRAWLING ON MY LEGS. FROM THIS POINT MY HEALTH WENT INTO A DOWNWARD SPIRAL AND I BECAME MORE DEPRESSED AS EACH DOCTOR'S APPT SUGGESTED SAME METHOD OF TREATMENT... SEEK MENTAL THERAPY. BY 1994, AFTER 19 YEARS OF IMPLANTS, MY HEALTH HIT ROCK BOTTOM. I WAS FATIGUED BEYOND POINT OF RECOVERY, NERVOUS, DEPRESSED AND, YES, SUICIDAL. MY BODY WOULD REACT TO SLIGHTEST STIMULANT AND I WAS HAVING SEVERE MEMORY LOSS, AND I BECAME DYSLEXIC. AT ONE POINT I WENT TO OUR LOCAL MARKET, LESS THAN A MILE FROM HOME, AND I COULDN'T REMEMBER HOW TO DRIVE HOME. I BEGAN TO LOSE MY BALANCE AND I HAD DISTORTED VISION. EVEN TODAY ONE OF MY PUPILS DOES NOT DILATE NORMALLY. I RETURNED MANY TIMES TO TRY TO FIND A CURE FOR MY RACING HEARTBEAT, MY RASH, STIFFNESS AND PAIN IN MY LIMBS, TREMOR IN MY HAND, EYE AND VAGINAL DRYNESS. AGAIN I WAS TOLD TO SEEK COUNSELING. OVER THIS PERIOD MY MARRIAGE FAILED AND I BEGAN TO THINK I WAS REALLY CRAZY. I CONSIDERED TAKING MY LIFE MANY TIMES. BY 1994 I WAS FALLING INTO A DEEP HOLE. AFTER A NEAR HEAD ON COLLISION BECAUSE I WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY DISCERNING LEFT FROM RIGHT I BEGAN TO FEAR DRIVING. MY LIFE WAS OUT OF CONTROL. AS A RESULT OF ALL MEDIA COVERAGE AROUND 1994 ON BREAST IMPLANTS I RETURNED TO MY PLASTIC SURGEON. HE TOLD ME THERE COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN MY ""IMAGINED SYMPTOMS"" AND BREAST IMPLANTS. HE DID, HOWEVER, CONCEDE THAT MY IMPLANTS ""LOOKED TERRIBLE"" DUE TO EVER PRESENT CAPSULES. HE RELUCTANTLY AGREED TO REMOVE MY IMPLANTS ON MAY 4, 1994. OF COURSE IT WAS SUGGESTED I REPLACE THEM WITH SALINE IMPLANTS WHICH I DECLINED. ONE MONTH AFTER EXPLANTATION I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BRAIN LESIONS WHICH EXPLAINS MY DIAGNOSES OF ATYPICAL MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. FOR SIX MONTHS MY SYMPTOMS SEEM TO INTENSIFY AND THEN I BEGAN TO SLOWLY IMPROVE. TODAY I LIVE WITH DISCOMFORT AND PAIN OF STIFF LEGS AND SENSATION OF SPIDERS ON MY SKIN IS STILL WITH ME. CLIMATE EXTREMES MAKES PAIN IN MY LEGS UNBEARABLE. MY MEMORY HAS IMPROVED AND I NO LONGER SUFFER, OR CAUSE OTHERS TO SUFFER, THOSE HORRIBLE AND UNPREDICTABLE MOOD SWINGS. MY CANCER IS IN REMISSION AND I AM ON MEDICATION FOR REST OF MY LIFE. MY RASH, IT APPEARS, IS WITH ME FOR LIFE. EVEN THOUGH I'VE HAD SOME IMPROVEMENT MY HEALTH HAS BEEN PERMANENTLY DAMAGED BY BREAST IMPLANTS. WHAT HAS ALL THIS MEANT TO ME? I AM ANGRY TO HAVE LOST 19 YEARS OF MY LIFE TO AVARICE AND DECEPTION OF DOW CORNING. I MOURN LOSS OF MY FIRST MARRIAGE AND I CAN'T HELP WONDERING WHAT LONG TERM HEALTH RISKS ARE FOR ME AND MY FELLOW SURVIVORS. WOULD I HAVE CONSENTED TO BREAST IMPLANTS HAD I BEEN TOLD OF CONSEQUENCES OR GIVEN CONSIDERATION OF READING MANY NEGATIVE TEST RESULTS DOW CORNING HAD AVAILABLE AS EARLY AS 1975? ABSOLUTELY NOT! I WILL DO ALL THAT IS POSSIBLE TO DISCOURAGE YOUNGER WOMEN FROM PURSUING IMPLANTS BE THEY SALINE, SOY, OR WHATEVER ELSE SOME MISGUIDED SCIENTIST DREAMS UP. I STRUGGLE EACH DAY TO COME TO TERMS WITH WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME. THER'S A PART OF ME THAT WANTS TO DENY DECEPTION AND LIES OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES.

AFTER A CHRONIC BREAST INFECTION, RPTR GOT BREAST IMPLANTS ADVISED. SO, THEY COULD ""AT LEAST"" WEAR A BRA. RPTR REALLY LOVED THAT IDEA. SURGEON TOLD RPTR: ""WHEN YOU DIE AT, SAY 80, YOUR BREASTS WILL BE STAYING STRAIGHT AHEAD. NO BREAST PROBLEMS ANYMORE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE"". IT TURNED OUT TO BE A GREAT DISASTER. RPTR HAD 18 SURGERIES. PROSTHESIS IN/OUT, IN/OUT, TRANSPLANTATION OF OWN TISSUE (WITHOUT SUCCESS), ANOTHER RECONSTRUCTION-TRY, PROSTHESIS IN/OUT, ETC. WITHIN 3 YEARS, RPTR GOT RHEUMATISM (R.A.) DIAGNOSED (WAS FORCED TO MOVE INTO A SPECIAL HOUSE FOR DISABLED PEOPLE) AND A LOT OF OTHER DISEASES WHICH DIDN'T FIT THEM AT ALL. THEIR BODY TOLD ANOTHER TALE, SO EVERYTHING WAS ALL IN THEIR MIND. IN 1990 A RUPTURED IMPLANT WAS REMOVED AND A ""VERY SAFE"" THICK ONE RE-IMPLANTED. SPECIALIST ASSURED RPTR THAT THIS NEW DEVICE DIDN'T CAUSE PROBLEMS. RPTR RECOVERED, COULD WALK WITHOUT PAIN (MIRACLE). ALAS ONLY FOR 2 MOS. THE NEW (LOW BLEED) IMPLANT STARTED TO POISON RPTR'S BODY AGAIN AND MADE THEM SICK AS NEVER BEFORE. RPTR WAS COMPLETELY DISABLED AND HELPLESS. THE ONLY WAY TO SURVIVE WAS A RADICAL EXPLANTATION OF THIS SICK-MAKER, A VERY HARD DECISION. DURING THAT TIME RPTR LAID HANDS ON AN INTERESTING MEDICAL REPORT (PUBLICIZED IN 1987) ABOUT THE POSSIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN SILICONE AND IMMUNE DISORDERS LIKE RHEUMATISM, NAMED H.A.D., ILUMAN ADJUVANT DISEASE. RPTR COULD NOT AND STILL CANNOT FIND WORDS TO EXPRESS THEIR FEELINGS OF ANGER AND BETRAYAL. ALL THOSE LOST YEARS. ALL THIS PAIN, SCARS, DESPAIR. NOT ONLY FOR THEMSELF, ALSO FOR THEIR SPOUSE AND CHILDREN. BEFORE RPTR REALIZED IT THEY WERE THE ""HEAD OF A FAST GROWING SUPPORT GROUP FOR WOMEN WITH SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS, OFFICIALLY REGISTERED BY LAW 5/7/92. RPTR'S BODY LOOKED AWFUL; ONE BREAST WAS COMPLETELY GONE. SINCE RPTR STARTED THEIR CRUSADE THEY HAVE HEARD THE VERY SAME STORY OVER 4,000 TIMES. THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR RPTR. CONTACTED OTHER GROUPS AROUND THE WORLD, ONLY ""THE TONGUE"" WAS DIFFERENT, THE TALE THE VERY SAME. RPTR ALSO WROTE OR PHONED TO DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES ALL OVER THE WORLD TO INFORM THEMSELF AS WELL AS POSSIBLE. PLASTIC SURGEONS HARDLY INFORM THE WOMEN ABOUT POSSIBLE FUTURE HEALTH RISKS BOTH TO THEMSELVES AND THEIR YET UNBORN BABIES. THEY ONLY SHOW NICE PICTURES. ""SILICONE IS AN INERT MATERIAL, NO DANGER AT ALL! THE WORLDWIDE COMMOTION IS GOSSIP FROM HYSTERICAL WOMEN, OUT FOR MONEY. NOTHING SCIENTIFIC PROVEN, NO LINK IS FOUND TILL NOW, AS LONG AS IT ISN'T BANNED I GO ON!"", IS THEIR FAVORITE SLOGAN, IT IS POSSIBLE HERE TO BUY YOUR BREASTS NOW AND PAY MONTHLY, YOU CAN READ THAT IN ALL ADS IN ALL NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES. I THINK THAT IS A VERY HYPOCRITICAL WAY TO TRANSLATE THE OATH OF HYPOCRATIS, THE MAMMON ABOVE THE HUMAN BEINGS. SINCE THE START OF SUPPORT GROUP IN 1992 TILL NOW RPTR HAS ANSWERED OVER 20,000 TELEPHONE-CALLS (FROM 5 MINS TO 1 1/2 HRS OR EVEN MORE) AND HEARD MORE THAN 4,000 TIMES THE VERY SAME STORY, SOMETIMES ANONYMOUS. THEY ALL RECEIVED INFORMATION-PACKET TO HELP THEM TO FIND THEIR WAY. GROUP ALSO SENT THE WOMEN DIFFERENT QUESTIONNAIRES FOR MORE INVESTIGATION. THE FIRST ONE WITH ABOUT 100 ANSWER POSSIBILITIES. AGE OF THE WOMEN BETWEEN 17-78 YEARS. AGE OF IMPLANTS: ONE MONTH-35 YEARS. THE RESULTS WERE SHOCKING, BUT NOT SCIENTIFIC, THAT CAME LATER THANKS TO THE UNIVERSITY WHO ANALYZED ALL RESULTS. THE MOST SHOCKING PART, THE ANSWERS FROM MOTHERS WITH CHILDREN BEFORE AND AFTER THEIR IMPLANTS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE KIDS AND THEIR MEDICAL COMPLAINTS. OVER 199 CHILDREN ARE REGISTERED. FINDINGS WERE THE VERY SAME AS WRITTEN IN A CHILDREN HOSPITAL REPORT (1993). 83% OF THE WOMEN WHO CONTACTED SUPPORT GROUP DID HAVE MANY OF THE WELL-KNOWN DISEASES. THAT IS OVER 10% OF THE VALUED 30,000 WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS IN RTPR'S COUNTRY. 14% WANTED INFO ABOUT AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION. 2% DID NOT (YET) HAVE PROBLEMS. 1% WAS SUFFERING DUE TO OTHER MEDICAL DEVICES LIKE HIPS, TESTICLES, INJECTIONS, NEEDLES, ETC. OF THOSE 83% IS THE SCORE 99% WITH MUSCLE/JOINT PAINS, OFTEN FALSELY DIAGNOSED AS R.A. OR FIBROMYALGIA. CHRONIC FATIGUE: 98%. MEMORY LOSS, SHORT MEMORY AND BAD CONCENTRATION: 93%. MOST OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS (1487, ALL DOCUMENTED) SCORED HIGHER THAN 70%. BY EXPLANATION OVER 80% OF THE IMPLANTS WERE RUPTURED OR VISIBLY LEAKING/BLEEDING. THAT IS WHAT THE WOMEN TOLD RPTR, BUT MOSTLY NOT WRITTEN IN THEIR FILES NOR REGISTERED. 40% OF THE EXPLANTED WOMEN RECOVERED QUITE A LOT WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR. ABOUT 45% NEEDED 2 TO 5 YEARS TO FEEL BETTER. THE OTHERS, ALAS, HAVE PASSED THE WAY OF NO RETURN. NO IDEA HOW LONG THEY'LL STAY AMONG THEM. 15-20 LADIES ARE TERRIBLY SICK, GOING DOWN HILL DAILY, SOME ARE TERMINAL BY NOW. 7 TIMES THEY FOUND A TUMOR TOO LATE (AS FAR AS RPTR HAS HEARD). 16 LADIES ALREADY DIED, WITHOUT KNOWING WHY. FIVE OF THEM RPTR KNEW VERY WELL, ALMOST TILL THE VERY LAST MINUTE. ONE COMMITTED SUICIDE, 34 YEARS OLD. THEY COULD NOT STAND THE PAIN ANYMORE AND THEIR MAIMED BODY. BUT MOST OF THE IMPLANTS WERE RUPTURED (ENVELOPE GONE) OR THERE WAS VISIBLE BLEEDING. THERE ARE ALSO 2 BABIES RPTR KNOWS ABOUT. ONE CHOKED IN MUCUS AFTER BEING BREASTFED, ONLY 6 WEEKS OLD. THE OTHER ONE BLED TO DEATH, 2 WEEKS BEFORE BIRTH. NO REASON FOUND. ONLY A STRANGE DISORDER IN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. HEALTH GOVERNMENT DOESN'T TAKE ALL COMPLAINTS SERIOUSLY; THEY DON'T REALIZE THE REALITY IS EVEN MORE THAN WORSE. THEY HARDLY LISTEN TO RPTR. THEY EVEN DON'T BELIEVE RPTR AND DO NOTHING FOR THE SICK WOMEN, CHILDREN AND MEN. NO MEDICATION, NO TREATMENT, NO HELP AT ALL FOR THIS BETRAYED POPULATION. RPTR THINKS ALL THEIR HEALTH MINISTERS ARE RESPONSIBLE.

RECALL & CALCULATION PROBLEMS OR BRAIN FOG. DIAGNOSED WITH FIBROMYALGIA & CFS THAT HAS BECOME DEBILITATING. SUCH A WEAKNESS OF THE ARMS THAT PT CANNOT EVEN LIFT A POT TO COOK. HEAVY PAINFUL PERIODS. STRANGE HAIR GROWTH ON THEIR BODY LIKE A MAN BUT LOSING IT FROM THEIR HEAD IN CLUMPS; HAIR DRYNESS, THINNING & BREAKAGE. PT WENT FROM BEING CONSTIPATED FREQUENTLY TO HAVING LOOSE STOOLS DAILY. EXTREME JOINT PAIN HAS GOTTEN PROGRESSIVELY WORSE. IRRITABLE BOWEL & BLOOD IN STOOL 2002, 2003. CHRONIC FATIGUE HAS GOTTEN PROGRESSIVELY WORSE ESPECIALLY THE PAST TWO YEARS WHEN SUSPECTED LEAKAGE OF LEFT IMPLANT BEGAN. PT FREQUENTLY HAS TO MISS WORK & SLEEP DAYS AWAY DUE TO BODY PAIN & EXHAUSTION. LOUD CRACKING OF ALL THE JOINTS IN THE BODY HAS GOTTEN MUCH WORSE THIS YEAR IN 2003. HEADACHES & NECK ACHES ENTIRE TIME THAT HAVE GOTTEN PROGRESSIVELY WORSE & ARE ALMOST CONSTANT NOW. LIFE BLOOD CELL ANALYSIS IN 2003 REVEALS FUNGUS IN THE BLOOD & BACTERIA. LUMPINESS IN CHEST & SWOLLEN/PAINFUL LYMPH NODES SURROUNDING THE IMPLANTS HAVE MADE PT DRS RECOMMEND A MAMMOGRAM, WHICH PT CANNOT HAVE ADEQUATELY WITH THE IMPLANTS IN.

TMJ & MYOFACIAL PAIN ENTIRE TIME BUT HAS GOTTEN PROGRESSIVELY WORSE. TINGLING IN ARMS & LEGS ALMOST LIKE THEY ARE ASLEEP BUT THEY ARE NOT SINCE ABOUT 2001. SORES & BRUISES THAT DO NOT HEAL FOR MONTHS & YEARS EVEN JUST FROM A SCRATCH OR SIMPLE BRUISE. THEIR BODY DOES NOT HEAL. SJOGREN'S SYNDROME & SICCA SYNDROME, SEVERELY DRY EYES, MOUTH, NOSE HAS GOTTEN PROGRESSIVELY WORSE. RAYNAUD'S PHENOMENON HAS GOTTEN PROGRESSIVELY WORSE ESPECIALLY THE PAST TWO YEARS WHEN SUSPECTED LEAKAGE OF LEFT IMPLANT BEGAN. STRANGE SHIVERS ALL DOWN THEIR NERVOUS SYSTEM BEGAN ABOUT A YEAR AGO & HAPPEN SEVERAL TIMES DAILY. DIFFICULTY SWALLOWING & THROAT PAIN SOMETIMES SWOLLEN LYMPH NODES AROUND THROAT. PT CHOKES ON FLUIDS ALMOST EVERY TIME PT DRINKS. PT CONCENTRATES SOMETIMES SO PT DOES NOT CHOKE & CHOKES ANYWAYS. NOT THE SAME WITH FOOD, MOSTLY LIQUIDS. DEEP HOARSE VOICE FOR ABOUT A YEAR BUT IT WENT AWAY MOSTLY ONCE THE THYROID MEDICATION WAS INCREASED. NIGHT SWEATS. FREQUENT LOW-GRADE FEVER. NO SEX DRIVE. HEARING PROBLEMS, LIKE UNDERWATER. IMPLANTS GROWING LARGE FOR A WEEK OR SO & THEN GETTING NORMAL AGAIN DOING THE SAME THING THE OPPOSITE WAY. JUST DIAGNOSED WITH CLARKS NEVIS PRE-SKIN CANCER. PT HAS SEEN OVER A DOZEN DRS FOR ALL THE COMPLICATIONS LISTED ABOVE AND HAD HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF MEDICAL TESTS RUN. PT HAD THE IMPLANTS REMOVED IN 2003 AND WITH THE IMPLANTS OUT PT IS SLOWLY GETTING BETTER.

IN 1993, AFTER RUPTURE WAS DETECTED THESE IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED. THE FINDINGS WERE THE CAPSULE IN THE BREAST DOES NOT CONTAIN THE LOOSE SILICONE, AS MINE HAD MIGRATED TO MY LEFT AXILLA AREA AGAIN.

THE INFECTION WOULD NOT CLEAR UP AND THAT RESULTED IN HAVING TO UNDERGO SURGERY TO REMOVE EXPANDERS AND PLACE IMPLANTS EARLIER THAN ANTICIPATED. THE EXPANDERS WERE REMOVED AND NATRELLE SILICONE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANTS (STYLE 20) WERE PLACED ON (B)(6) 2009. THE LEFT BREAST IS 500CC REF 20-500 SN (B)(4) AND THE RIGHT BREAST IS 500CC REF 20-500 SN (B)(4). IN (B)(6) 2012, I BEGAN EXPERIENCING SEVERE NAUSEA, VOMITING, CONSTIPATION, AND WEIGHT LOSS (DROPPED NEARLY 40 POUNDS IN TWO MONTHS). I SAW MY PCP AND THEY DID EXTENSIVE TESTING AND DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING. A TUMOR WAS FOUND IN THE HYSTERECTOMY BED (HISTORY OF CANCER AND COMPLETE HYSTERECTOMY AND LEFT SALPINGO OOPHORECTOMY IN (B)(6) 2005 AND SUBSEQUENT RIGHT SALPINGO OOPHORECTOMY IN (B)(6) 2010). SURGERY REVEALED LARGE BENIGN TUMOR. THE GI PROBLEMS WERE REMOVED AND I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ESOPHAGITIS AND GASTRITIS. A YEAR LATER, (B)(6) 2014, I BEGAN HAVING JOINT PAIN THAT WOULD NOT GO AWAY DESPITE OTC NSAIDS. IN (B)(6), I SAW MY PCP WHO REFERRED ME TO A RHEUMATOLOGIST. I SAW THE RHEUMATOLOGIST AND WAS DIAGNOSED ON (B)(6) 2014, WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. SINCE THEN, I HAVE TAKEN IMURAN, ENBREL, PREDNISONE, LYRICA, AND VIMOVO. NONE OF THE MEDICATIONS HAVE PROVIDED REPRIEVE FROM MY SYMPTOMS. I BEGAN TO BECOME SKEPTICAL OF THE RA DIAGNOSIS, SO I BEGAN RESEARCHING MY MEDICAL RECORDS AND FOUND A DISCLAIMER IN THE SURGICAL CONSENT FORMS FOR THE SILICONE IMPLANTS THAT THERE MAY BE A LINK BETWEEN SILICONE IMPLANTS AND AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES SUCH AS SLE, RA, SCLERODERMA, AND OTHER ARTHRITIS-LIKE CONDITIONS. SINCE 2012, I HAVE EXPERIENCED AND CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE TO A GREATER DEGREE ALL THE SYMPTOMS NOTED: SWELLING AND/OR JOINT PAIN OR ARTHRITIS-LIKE PAIN, GENERAL ACHING, UNUSUAL HAIR LOSS, UNEXPLAINED OR UNUSUAL LOSS OF ENERGY, MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO COLDS, FLU, ETC., SWOLLEN GLANDS AND LYMPH NODES, RASH (ON FACE THAT HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED AS SEBORRHEIC DERMATITIS SUGGESTIVE OF AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE), SEVERE MEMORY PROBLEMS, HEADACHES, MUSCLE WEAKNESS OR BURNING, NAUSEA, VOMITING, IBS, AND FEVER. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IS MERELY COINCIDENTAL AS I NEVER HAD PROBLEMS LIKE THIS PRIOR TO THE MASTECTOMY AND RECONSTRUCTION. THEREFORE, I CONCLUDE THAT THE SILICONE EXPANDERS AND IMPLANTS ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO MY SYMPTOMS AND CONDITION. POSSIBLY, OTHER VARIABLES COULD CONTRIBUTE SUCH AS GENETIC PREDISPOSITION AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS.

4231760|4971239|D|1||I HAD A PROPHYLACTIC BILATERAL MASTECTOMY WITH RECONSTRUCTION USING INAMED AESTHETICS MCGHAN SILICONE TISSUE EXPANDERS ON (B)(6) 2009. I EXPERIENCED PROBLEMS WITH THE TISSUE EXPANDER IN THE RIGHT BREAST AS IT SHIFTED POSITION FREQUENTLY AND CAUSED INFECTION TWICE AND WAS TREATED WITH MINOCYCLINE (WHICH I EVENTUALLY DEVELOPED AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO THAT PARTICULAR ANTIBIOTIC). THE INFECTION WOULD NOT CLEAR UP AND THAT RESULTED IN HAVING TO UNDERGO SURGERY TO REMOVE EXPANDERS AND PLACE IMPLANTS EARLIER THAN ANTICIPATED. THE EXPANDERS WERE REMOVED AND NATRELLE SILICONE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANTS (STYLE 20) WERE PLACED ON (B)(6) 2009. THE LEFT BREAST IS 500CC REF 20-500 SN (B)(4) AND THE RIGHT BREAST IS 500CC REF 20-500 SN (B)(4). IN (B)(6) 2012, I BEGAN EXPERIENCING SEVERE NAUSEA, VOMITING, CONSTIPATION, AND WEIGHT LOSS (DROPPED NEARLY 40 POUNDS IN TWO MONTHS). I SAW MY PCP AND THEY DID EXTENSIVE TESTING AND DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING. A TUMOR WAS FOUND IN THE HYSTERECTOMY BED (HISTORY OF CANCER AND COMPLETE HYSTERECTOMY AND LEFT SALPINGO OOPHORECTOMY IN (B)(6) 2005 AND SUBSEQUENT RIGHT SALPINGO OOPHORECTOMY IN (B)(6) 2010). SURGERY REVEALED LARGE BENIGN TUMOR. THE GI PROBLEMS WERE REMOVED AND I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ESOPHAGITIS AND GASTRITIS. A YEAR LATER, (B)(6) 2014, I BEGAN HAVING JOINT PAIN THAT WOULD NOT GO AWAY DESPITE OTC NSAIDS. IN (B)(6), I SAW MY PCP WHO REFERRED ME TO A RHEUMATOLOGIST. I SAW THE RHEUMATOLOGIST AND WAS DIAGNOSED ON (B)(6) 2014, WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. SINCE THEN, I HAVE TAKEN IMURAN, ENBREL, PREDNISONE, LYRICA, AND VIMOVO. NONE OF THE MEDICATIONS HAVE PROVIDED REPRIEVE FROM MY SYMPTOMS. I BEGAN TO BECOME SKEPTICAL OF THE RA DIAGNOSIS, SO I BEGAN RESEARCHING MY MEDICAL RECORDS AND FOUND A DISCLAIMER IN THE SURGICAL CONSENT FORMS FOR THE SILICONE IMPLANTS THAT THERE MAY BE A LINK BETWEEN SILICONE IMPLANTS AND AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES SUCH AS SLE, RA, SCLERODERMA, AND OTHER ARTHRITIS-LIKE CONDITIONS. SINCE 2012, I HAVE EXPERIENCED AND CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE TO A GREATER DEGREE ALL THE SYMPTOMS NOTED: SWELLING AND/OR JOINT PAIN OR ARTHRITIS-LIKE PAIN, GENERAL ACHING, UNUSUAL HAIR LOSS, UNEXPLAINED OR UNUSUAL LOSS OF ENERGY, MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO COLDS, FLU, ETC., SWOLLEN GLANDS AND LYMPH NODES, RASH (ON FACE THAT HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED AS SEBORRHEIC DERMATITIS SUGGESTIVE OF AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE), SEVERE MEMORY PROBLEMS, HEADACHES, MUSCLE WEAKNESS OR BURNING, NAUSEA, VOMITING, IBS, AND FEVER. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IS MERELY COINCIDENTAL AS I NEVER HAD PROBLEMS LIKE THIS PRIOR TO THE MASTECTOMY AND RECONSTRUCTION. THEREFORE, I CONCLUDE THAT THE SILICONE EXPANDERS AND IMPLANTS ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO MY SYMPTOMS AND CONDITION. POSSIBLY, OTHER VARIABLES COULD CONTRIBUTE SUCH AS GENETIC PREDISPOSITION AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. HOWEVER, IN MY CASE THERE IS ENOUGH MEDICAL DATA TO INDICATE A CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SILICONE EXPANDERS AND IMPLANTS TO MY AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE AND SYMPTOMS. I HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE REASON I HAVE NOT RESPONDED TO NSAIDS (OTC AND RX), DMARDS, AND BIOLOGICS IS BECAUSE THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM IS THE SILICONE IMPLANTS.
