1977779|1898938|D|1||I HAD SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS PUT IN (B)(6) OF 2007. ABOUT 7 MONTHS LATER, I STARTED TO EXPERIENCE: VERTIGO, HEART PALPITATIONS, MIGRAINES, RASHES, VISUAL DISTURBANCES AND PLUGGED EARS. THIS DID NOT GO AWAY! I WENT TO SEVERAL DOCTORS, HAD NUMEROUS SCANS, TONS OF BLOOD WORK DONE AND THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING. MY DOCTOR SAID I HAD ALLERGIES AND I WAS DEPRESSED. HE PUT ME ON ALLERGY MEDS. AND ANTI-DEPRESSANTS. THIS ONLY MADE ME WORSE. THEN I STARTED TO HAVE BODY PAIN FROM MY HIPS UP THAT DIDN'T GO AWAY. I WENT TO PHYSICAL THERAPY TWICE, CHANGED MY DIET, HAD MORE SCANS DONE AND AGAIN, THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING. I THOUGHT I WAS DYING! I HAD TOLD ALL THE DOCTORS (ENT, ALLERGIST, INTERNIST, CARDIOLOGIST, NEUROLOGIST, FAMILY DOCTOR) THAT I HAD IMPLANTS AND THEY ALL SAID THAT IT WASN'T FROM MY IMPLANTS. I CAN'T BELIEVE I BELIEVED THEM AND NOT MY GUT FEELING. ABOUT 2 YEARS LATER, BARELY HOLDING ON TO MY JOB, MY HUSBAND ETC., I STARTED DOING RESEARCH ON SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS. NOT ONLY DID I FIND NUMEROUS SUPPORT GROUPS WITH 100'S (I WOULD SAY THOUSANDS HAVE BEEN ON THESE SITES) OF WOMEN WHO WERE SCARED TO DEATH OF WHAT THE IMPLANTS HAVE DONE TO THEIR LIVES AND BODIES. SOME OF THEM CAN'T WORK, SOME OF THEM HAVE KILLED THEMSELVES AND SOME OF THEM HAVE JUST DIED BECAUSE OUR SOCIETY ONLY HAS A FEW SKILLED DOCTORS WHO KNOW HOW TO ADDRESS THEIR NEEDS AND THE REST OF THESE DOCTORS, WHO ARE HERE TO HELP US NOT SAY WE'RE DEPRESSED BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, SIMPLY REFUSE TO LISTEN OR DO THE RESEARCH ETC. I HAD MY IMPLANTS TAKEN OUT 5 MONTHS AGO. EVERYTHING HAS GONE AWAY EXCEPT A FEW THINGS: INFLAMMATION IN MY FRONT RIB/CHEST AREA, FATIGUE. I BELIEVE THIS IS SOME SORT OF CHONDRITIS DUE TO THE EXPLANT. I HAVE BEEN DETOXING THE TOXINS THAT WERE LEFT BEHIND FROM THE IMPLANTS AND I'M FEELING MUCH BETTER. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THE FDA CAN IGNORE ALL OF THESE WOMEN. MOST OF THEM ARE TOO SICK AND TIRED TO FIGHT BUT THIS IS BEING TALKED ABOUT MORE AND MORE. I WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN. MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS WILL NEVER VIEW THE FDA THE SAME AGAIN EITHER. I COME FROM A VERY EDUCATED FAMILY. WE DON'T HAVE MANY ILLNESSES (MY FATHER HAS ASTHMA, EVERYONE ELSE..BROTHERS..AUNTS ETC. ARE FINE) IN OUR FAMILY EITHER.
