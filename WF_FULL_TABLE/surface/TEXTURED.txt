DEVICE HISTORY RECORD REVIEW: REVIEW OF DHR FOR WORK ORDER 2183997 DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY DEVIATIONS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS OR NON-CONFORMANCES DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. ALL GEL BREAST IMPLANTS WERE REVIEWED AS PART OF THE ASSEMBLY OPERATIONS AND THESE TASKS WERE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO APPLICABLE CURRENT PROCEDURES TO ENSURE THAT ASSEMBLY MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. THE DHR ASSEMBLY REPORT FROM SAP WAS VERIFIED AND THERE WAS NO SCRAP RELATED WITH REPORTED EVENT, ALL DEVICES WERE CONFORMANCE DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION GATHERED DURING THE DHR REVIEW, THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT DEVICES FROM WORK ORDER 2183997 WERE ASSEMBLED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALLERGAN MEDICAL PROCEDURES AND SPECIFICATIONS. THE REPORTED DEVICE WAS INTACT AT THE TIME OF PRODUCTION AND MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. REPORTED EVENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN THE LABELING: PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENT. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. YOU SHOULD PERFORM SELF-EXAMINATION OF YOUR BREASTS EVERY MONTH FOR CANCER SCREENING. HOWEVER, THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU DISTINGUISH THE IMPLANT FROM YOUR BREAST TISSUE. THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGES IN IMPLANT SHAPE, MAY BE SIGNS OF A RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. THESE SIGNS SHOULD BE REPORTED TO YOUR SURGEON AND POSSIBLY EVALUATED WITH AN MRI. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM.

DEVICE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. ONE OF THE KEY COMPLICATIONS REPORTED IS CALLED Â¿CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS A TIGHTENING OF THE SCAR TISSUE (ALSO CALLED A CAPSULE) THAT NORMALLY FORMS AROUND THE BREAST IMPLANT DURING THE HEALING PROCESS AFTER SURGERY. IN SOME WOMEN, THE SCAR TISSUE (CAPSULE) SQUEEZES THE IMPLANT. THIS RESULTS IN FIRMNESS OR HARDENING OF THE BREAST, AND IT IS A RISK FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE. DEGREES OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE ARE CLASSIFIED BY THE BAKER GRADING SCALE. 1 CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BAKER GRADES III AND IV ARE THE MOST SEVERE. BAKER GRADE III OFTEN RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SURGERY (REOPERATION) BECAUSE OF PAIN AND POSSIBLY ABNORMAL APPEARANCE. BAKER GRADE IV USUALLY RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR REOPERATION BECAUSE OF PAIN AND UNACCEPTABLE APPEARANCE.

IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM.

THE REPORTED EVENTS ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THESE EVENTS. REVIEW OF DHR (DEVICE HISTORY RECORD) FOR WORK ORDER (B)(4) DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY DEVIATIONS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS OR NON-CONFORMANCES DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. ALL GEL BREAST IMPLANTS WERE REVIEWED AS PART OF THE ASSEMBLY OPERATIONS AND THESE TASKS WERE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO APPLICABLE CURRENT PROCEDURES TO ENSURE THAT ASSEMBLY MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. DHR FOR WORK ORDER (B)(4) INDICATES THAT THERE WAS A REPROCESS FOR TWO UNITS ON THE PRIMARY PACKAGING OPERATION, HOWEVER THIS WAS COMPLETED ON A DIFFERENT SERIAL NUMBER UNIT AND THIS HAS NO RELATION NEITHER CAN CAUSE THE REPORTED EVENT. THE DHR ASSEMBLY REPORT FROM ORACLE WAS VERIFIED AND THERE WAS NOT ANY SCRAP RELATED WITH REPORTED EVENT, ALL DEVICES WERE CONFORMANCE DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION GATHERED DURING THE DHR REVIEW, THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT DEVICES FROM WORK ORDER (B)(4) WERE ASSEMBLED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALLERGAN MEDICAL PROCEDURES AND SPECIFICATIONS. THE REPORTED DEVICE WAS INTACT AT THE TIME OF PRODUCTION AND MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. REPORTED EVENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN THE LABELING: ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. YOU SHOULD PERFORM SELF-EXAMINATION OF YOUR BREASTS EVERY MONTH FOR CANCER SCREENING. HOWEVER, THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU DISTINGUISH THE IMPLANT FROM YOUR BREAST TISSUE. THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGES IN IMPLANT SHAPE, MAY BE SIGNS OF A RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. THESE SIGNS SHOULD BE REPORTED TO YOUR SURGEON AND POSSIBLY EVALUATED WITH AN MRI. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.|INSPIRA TEXTURED SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|TRM310|05/04/2017||||N|R||0HP|FTR|1.0|09/14/2011|PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||1327562|KILBRIDE INDUSTRIAL ESTATE||ARKLOW, COUNTY WICKLOW||ALLERGAN (ARKLOW)|||||||True|False|False|True

CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION.|INSPIRA TEXTURED SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|N-TSX255|01/25/2017||||Y|*||0HP|FTR|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||2465761|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True|False|False|True

6575692|75546313|D|1||MY SITUATION WAS AS SUCH: IN (B)(6) 2015 AFTER BEING DIAGNOSED WITH DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS) FOR A THIRD TIME IN 12 YEARS, I HAD A MASTECTOMY WITH IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION ON MY RIGHT SIDE, WITH A MENTOR GEL-FILLED IMPLANT. WITHIN TWO MONTHS OF MY OPERATION, I HAD AN ODD PERSPIRATION ODOR WHICH REMAINED WITH ME PERMANENTLY. IN THE SPRING OF 2016, I BEGAN FEELING TIRED AFTER MY GYM WORKOUTS, QUITE UNUSUAL AS I HAD ALWAYS EXERCISED REGULARLY, AND I WAS IN PERFECT HEALTH. BY (B)(6) 2016, I BEGAN EXPERIENCING TINGLING AND NUMBNESS IN MY FINGERS, WHICH WAS NOT GOING AWAY. I THEN BEGAN TO HAVE SWOLLEN FINGERS, HANDS AND WRISTS IN (B)(6) OF THE SAME YEAR, WHICH LED TO MY BEING DIAGNOSED WITH CARPEL TUNNEL SYNDROME BY A RHEUMATOLOGIST. THE RHEUMATOLOGIST TOOK BLOOD TESTS AND RESULTS SHOWED I HAD AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE KNOWN AS SCLERODERMA. I WAS SHOCKED AS NOTHING LIKE THIS WAS EVER HEARD OF IN MY FAMILY. I COME FROM A LONG LINE OF HEALTHY PEOPLE WHO MOSTLY LIVE INTO THEIR NINETIES. BY THIS TIME, TOO, I BEGAN FEELING MALAISE, AND I THEN WAS WEAKENED TO THE POINT OF BEING UNABLE TO WALK UNAIDED. FROM THE MIDDLE OF (B)(6)(THE DATE MY PLASTIC SURGEON EXPLANTED THE IMPLANT), I BECAME SO DEBILITATED THAT I COULD NO LONGER WALK. I LOST 20LBS OF MUSCLE DURING THIS ABOVE-NOTED PERIOD, AS MY ARM, LEG AND REAR MUSCLES ATROPHIED, RESULTING IN ME BEING TOTALLY DEBILITATED. I WAS IN EXTREME PAIN, AND I BEGAN LOSING MY HAIR. I COULDNÂ¿T THINK CLEARLY, AND I COULD NOT SLEEP. I SUFFERED FROM EXTREME FATIGUE, AND MY JOINTS WERE SWOLLEN, ESPECIALLY MY RIGHT KNEE. I HAD UPPER BACK AND NECK WEAKNESS. I COULD NOT RAISE MY ARMS, MOVE MY LEGS OR USE MY HANDS. ALL SYMPTOMS STARTED ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF MY BODY, AND WERE MORE SEVERE THAN ON THE LEFT SIDE OF MY BODY. WHEN I TOLD THE RHEUMATOLOGIST ON (B)(6), THAT I HAD AN IMPLANT AND THAT I HAD MADE AN APPOINTMENT TO SEE MY PLASTIC SURGEON THE VERY NEXT DAY SHE SAID, Â¿YOU ARE RIGHT TO MENTION THIS TO ME. AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES ARE OFTEN CAUSED BY EXTERNAL REASONS, AND ARE NOT ALWAYS HEREDITARY.Â¿ IN THIS WAY, SHE CONFIRMED THAT IT COULD BE BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESS THAT I WAS SUFFERING FROM. THE NEXT DAY, MY PLASTIC SURGEON AGREED TO EXPLANT MY MENTOR GEL-FILLED IMPLANT STATING THAT HE COULD NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE IMPLANT WAS CAUSING MY DEBILITATION AND THAT I MIGHT NOT REGAIN MY HEALTH. THE SURGERY WAS ON A THURSDAY MORNING, AND I NEEDED A WHEELCHAIR BY THIS TIME. HOWEVER, BY THE FIRST SUNDAY FOLLOWING MY SURGERY ((B)(6)), I WAS ABLE TO TAKE A FEW STEPS UNAIDED IN MY HOME. TWO WEEKS LATER, I WAS APPROVED BY MY MEDICAL INSURANCE COMPANY TO RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING ASSISTANCE IN MY HOME; PHYSICAL THERAPY, OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY, A PERSONAL AIDE, A NURSE AND A SOCIAL WORKER. I WAS ABLE TO HAVE A VISITING NUN COME ONCE A WEEK ALSO. IT IS NOW (B)(6) 2017 AND I AM ABLE TO WALK AGAIN. I WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE SERVICES FROM THE OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST AND THE SOCIAL WORKER. MY PHYSICAL THERAPIST TOLD ME I MUST MAINTAIN AN EXERCISE PROGRAM THAT HE PRESCRIBED FOR ME. MY PERSONAL AIDE AND THE NURSE HAVE STOPPED COMING NOW AS I AM FINALLY SHOWING SIGNS OF RECOVERY. I CONTINUE TO HAVE SWELLING IN MY HANDS AND WEAKNESS IN MY UPPER ARMS, NECK AND BACK. IT IS QUITE DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT THE MENTOR GEL-FILLED IMPLANT WAS LEECHING OR BLEEDING TOXINS INTO MY BODY TO THE EXTENT THAT I WAS TOTALLY DEBILITATED FOR OVER 10 MONTHS OF MY LIFE. I THANK THE RHEUMATOLOGIST FOR VALIDATING THE FACT THAT THE IMPLANT COULD BE THE CAUSE. I HAVE BEEN ON A DETOX DIET SINCE (B)(6) 2016. I WAS UNABLE TO LEAVE MY HOUSE UNAIDED FROM (B)(6) DUE TO THIS ILLNESS. I ONLY LEFT THE HOUSE FOR DOCTOR APPOINTMENTS. I COULD NOT TAKE MYSELF TO THESE APPOINTMENTS. AT PRESENT, I CANNOT SIT FOR LONG, TIRE EASILY AND CANNOT DRIVE FAR. MY UPPER BODY MUSCLES ACHE, AND I CONTINUE TO HAVE DIFFICULTY SLEEPING.

ACCORDING TO PHYSICIAN'S LETTER DATED 10/25/93, PT HAD AN AUGMENTATION MAMMOPLASTY DONE ON 3/11/82, AT WHICH TIME 250 CC CONTOURED TYPE GEL PROSTHESES WERE UTILIZED. ABOUT THREE YRS AGO SHE RECEIVED A BEAR HUG AND FELT SOMETHING POP ON THE LEFT SIDE. SINCE THAT TIME SHE HAS HAD CONTINUAL PAIN AND SORENESS IN THE LEFT BREAST. SHE HAS NOTICED THAT IT HAS GOTTEN QUITE HARD AND FIRM, AND IT HAS BEEN A CONSTANT SOURCE OF TROUBLE AND IRRITATION. PT ALSO SEEMS CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT IS SILICONE GEL, DUE TO ALL THE CONTROVERSY RECENTLY. OF ALL SUGGESTIONS MADE CONCERNING THIS PROBLEM, THE ALTERNATIVE SHE PREFERS IS TO HAVE THE IMPLANTS REMOVED AND SUBSTITUTED WITH TEXTURED SALINE. THE CONTRACTURE ON THE LEFT IS A GRADE III TO IV, WITH SOME UPPER POLE DISTORTION, WHILE THE RIGHT BREAST IS STILL FAIRLY GOOD. IN CORRESPONDENCE DATED 1/27/94, PHYSICIAN STATES PT IS HAVING QUITE A FEW ADD'L PROBLEMS THAT SHOULD BE NOTED. FIRST, SHE STATES THE PAIN IS QUITE SEVERE, TO THE POINT SHE CANNOT WEAR HER BRA. SHE HAS SHOOTING PAINS IN THE LEFT BREAST AND NIPPLE, THAT GO THROUGH HER SIDE AND DOWN HER ARM. SHE MUST AVOID ANY TYPE OF HEAVY, STRENUOUS ACTIVITY, SUCH AS MOVING FURNITURE WHILE CLEANING, AS THIS CAUSES HER GREAT PAIN, AND HAS REQUIRED BEDREST TO RECOVER. SHE OFTEN USES THE HEATING PAD AND ICY HOT TO TRY TO REDUCE HER DISCOMFORT. IT APPEARS TO RPTR THAT WITH ALL THESE SYMPTOMS, SHE WOULD BE A REASONABLE CANDIDATE FOR REMOVAL OF THE OLD IMPLANTS AND SUBSTITUTE WITH THE TEXTURED SALINE.|SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLNAT|936|03/29/1994|B|||Y||12365.0|*|FTR|1.0||nan|N|H021043|||MIDLAND|US|DOW CORNING CORP.||MI|48686|0994|||False|False|True|True

ALL OF THE RISKS, ALTERNATIVES AND IMPONDERABLES WERE DISCUSSED WITH THE PT PRIOR TO PROCEEDING. ABSOLUTELY NO GURANTEES, WHATSOEVER, WERE MADE. THIS PT HAD ROCK-HARD IMPLANTS BILATERALLY WITH INDETERMINATE MAMMOGRAMS BILATERALLY AND PROBABLE LEAKING SILICONE IMPLANTS BILATERALLY, WHICH WAS DOCUMENTED CLEARLY DURING THE PROCEDURE. THE PREVIOUS INFRAMAMMARY INCISIONS WERE EXTENDED ON EACH SIDE. DISSECTION WAS CARRIED DOWN THROUGH A VERY THICK CAPSULAR SHELL WITH A LARGE AMOUNT OF WHITISH, CREAMY TISSUE COMPATIBLE WITH SAPONIFICATION. BOTH OF THE IMPLANTS WERE BROKEN. THE MATERIAL WAS CONTAINED WITHIN AN EXTREMELY THICK SHELL, AND THE SHELL ITSELF WAS VERY RAGGED WITH EXTENSIVE CALCIFICATION, WHICH BECAUSE OF THE SHARP EDGES COULD CERTAINLY ACCOUNT FOR THE RUPTURED IMPLANTS. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY GEL OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE.

996432|804087|D|1||"IN 1992, I HAD CORPORATION'S TEXTURED SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS. SEVEN MONTHS POST-OP, I STARTED EXPERIENCING DOUBLE VISION AND HAD MRI'S WITH WHITE MATTER, JOINT PAIN, NEURO DEFICITS, ETC. ALTHOUGH, I DID HAVE A PREVIOUS DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT FOR LYME'S DISEASE, I WAS SYMPTOM FREE FOR SEVERAL YEARS PRIOR TO THE IMPLANTS. I HAD A MEDICAL CLEARANCE TO GET THE IMPLANTS. FROM THERE ON IN MY EARLY 20'S, MY HEALTH WENT DOWN HILL DUE TO CHRONIC ILLNESS FROM THE IMPLANTS, ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY SWORE THEY WERE SAFE. THEY NEVER WARNED ME OF POSSIBLE IMMUNE SYSTEM DAMAGE OTHERWISE I NEVER WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THE. AFTER 13 YEARS OF CHRONIC ILLNESS, THEY WERE REMOVED AND THE CAPSULES DUE TO A RUPTURE. THE SAME DAY OF MY SURGERY, I HAD WEAKNESS IN MY LEFT ARM AND COULDN'T WRITE. MY LEFT ARM IS STILL WEAK. THEREE MONTHS LATER, I HAD OPTIC NEURITIS LOSS OF VISION IN ONE EYE RESULTING IN A NOW DEVASTATING DIAGNOSIS OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. MY PLASTIC SURGEON TOLD ME THAT THESE PARTICLULAR IMPLANTS, BECAUSE OF THE TEXTURE, FLAKE OFF AND HAVE CAUSED OTHER PT'S NEUROLOGICAL DAMAGE AND AN OVERACTIVE IMMUNE SYSTEM. TO THIS DAY, AS I ALMOST CONSIDERED REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANTS, THESE SAME IMPLANTS ARE STILL AVAILABLE BY CORP. WITH ALL OF THE ILLNESSESS AND WOMEN OUT THERE SICK, I CONTACTED CORP. PRIOR TO MY SURGERY TELLING THEM ABOUT MY CHRONIC ILLNESS AS THEY RECOMMENDED ME REPLACING THEN WITH SMOOTH SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS AS THEY TOLD ME THERE WOULD BE LESS CHANCE OF A RUPTURE RESULTING IN LESS SURGERIES THAT WOULD FURTHER COMPROMISE MY IMMUNE SYSTEM. I FIND IT PRETTY IGNORANT THAT THEY DIDN'T TELL ME A WAIVER MUST BE SIGNED PRIOR TO SURGERY IF I OPTED TO GET THE SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS AND THAT OTHER IMMUNE DISORDERS COULD RESULT FROM THE SILICONE FILLED IMPLANTS, LUPUS, ETC., IN WHICH MY SURGEON TOLD ME ABOUT. ALL THEY WANT TO DO IS POISON WOMEN FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR WALLETS! IF THE NOW APPROVED SILICONE GEL FILLED IMPLANTS ARE SO ""SAFE"" THEN WHY DO THEY MAKE A PT SIGN A RELEASE WAIVER OF LIABILITY? ALSO, IF ""SILICONE IS SO SAFE THAT IT IS EVEN IN OUR FOOD"" THEN WHY SIGN A WAVER? IF SALINE FILLED IMPLANTS ARE SO ""SAFE"" IN WHICH THE SHELLS ARE MADE OF THE SAME MATERIAL AS THE SILICONE GEL FILLED, WHY NOT HAVE WOMEN SIGN A WAIVER FOR THEM SO THEY AT LEAST KNOW WHAT THE POTENTIAL HEALTH RISKS CAN BE? I HAVE TWO YOUNG CHILDREN IN WHICH MY SON HAS CHRONIC ALLERGIES AND ASTHMA AND MY DAUGHTER COMPLAINS OF CHRONIC JOINT PAIN. I HAD THE IMPLANTS DURING BOTH PREGNANCIES. I BELIEVE ALL IMPLANTS SHOULD BE ILLEGAL AS ONE DAY IT COULD BE SOMEONE ELSE'S DAUGHTER PAYING A VERY HIGH PRICE THAT IS UNCHANGEABLE FOR THE SAKE OF VANITY. THE FDA SHOULD BE HONEST TOO, WITH POTENTIAL PTS ALSO AND OUTLAW ALL BREAST IMPLANTS."|MENTOR||02/02/2008|V|||N||967307.0|0HP|FWM|1.0||SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS|Y||*||||*|||||||False|False|True|True

IT WAS DESCRIBED AS HAVING A ""TAIL-LIKE"" APPEARANCE, AND HAD BEEN CAUSING ME SIGNIFICANT DISCOMFORT AND PAIN PRIOR TO MY EXPLANT. THE ODDEST THING IS THAT I HAD DEVELOPED PRETTY SEVERE YEAR-ROUND ALLERGIES AND ASTHMA WITHIN THREE MONTHS OF GETTING THE IMPLANTS PUT IN.

1977779|1898938|D|1||I HAD SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS PUT IN (B)(6) OF 2007. ABOUT 7 MONTHS LATER, I STARTED TO EXPERIENCE: VERTIGO, HEART PALPITATIONS, MIGRAINES, RASHES, VISUAL DISTURBANCES AND PLUGGED EARS. THIS DID NOT GO AWAY! I WENT TO SEVERAL DOCTORS, HAD NUMEROUS SCANS, TONS OF BLOOD WORK DONE AND THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING. MY DOCTOR SAID I HAD ALLERGIES AND I WAS DEPRESSED. HE PUT ME ON ALLERGY MEDS. AND ANTI-DEPRESSANTS. THIS ONLY MADE ME WORSE. THEN I STARTED TO HAVE BODY PAIN FROM MY HIPS UP THAT DIDN'T GO AWAY. I WENT TO PHYSICAL THERAPY TWICE, CHANGED MY DIET, HAD MORE SCANS DONE AND AGAIN, THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING. I THOUGHT I WAS DYING! I HAD TOLD ALL THE DOCTORS (ENT, ALLERGIST, INTERNIST, CARDIOLOGIST, NEUROLOGIST, FAMILY DOCTOR) THAT I HAD IMPLANTS AND THEY ALL SAID THAT IT WASN'T FROM MY IMPLANTS. I CAN'T BELIEVE I BELIEVED THEM AND NOT MY GUT FEELING. ABOUT 2 YEARS LATER, BARELY HOLDING ON TO MY JOB, MY HUSBAND ETC., I STARTED DOING RESEARCH ON SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS. NOT ONLY DID I FIND NUMEROUS SUPPORT GROUPS WITH 100'S (I WOULD SAY THOUSANDS HAVE BEEN ON THESE SITES) OF WOMEN WHO WERE SCARED TO DEATH OF WHAT THE IMPLANTS HAVE DONE TO THEIR LIVES AND BODIES. SOME OF THEM CAN'T WORK, SOME OF THEM HAVE KILLED THEMSELVES AND SOME OF THEM HAVE JUST DIED BECAUSE OUR SOCIETY ONLY HAS A FEW SKILLED DOCTORS WHO KNOW HOW TO ADDRESS THEIR NEEDS AND THE REST OF THESE DOCTORS, WHO ARE HERE TO HELP US NOT SAY WE'RE DEPRESSED BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, SIMPLY REFUSE TO LISTEN OR DO THE RESEARCH ETC. I HAD MY IMPLANTS TAKEN OUT 5 MONTHS AGO. EVERYTHING HAS GONE AWAY EXCEPT A FEW THINGS: INFLAMMATION IN MY FRONT RIB/CHEST AREA, FATIGUE. I BELIEVE THIS IS SOME SORT OF CHONDRITIS DUE TO THE EXPLANT. I HAVE BEEN DETOXING THE TOXINS THAT WERE LEFT BEHIND FROM THE IMPLANTS AND I'M FEELING MUCH BETTER. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THE FDA CAN IGNORE ALL OF THESE WOMEN. MOST OF THEM ARE TOO SICK AND TIRED TO FIGHT BUT THIS IS BEING TALKED ABOUT MORE AND MORE. I WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN. MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS WILL NEVER VIEW THE FDA THE SAME AGAIN EITHER. I COME FROM A VERY EDUCATED FAMILY. WE DON'T HAVE MANY ILLNESSES (MY FATHER HAS ASTHMA, EVERYONE ELSE..BROTHERS..AUNTS ETC. ARE FINE) IN OUR FAMILY EITHER.

A CT SCAN SHOWED AN ""INFOLDING OF THE IMPLANT BETWEEN 7 AND 9 O'CLOCK, WITH AN APPARENT MASS WITH SLIGHTLY INCREASED DENSITY"". IN (B)(6) 2009, SURGERY WAS PLANNED TO REMOVE THE PRESUMED RUPTURED IMPLANT. AT THE TIME OF SURGERY, A STRAW COLORED SEROMA OF 200CC WAS FOUND. THE IMPLANT WAS INTACT. WITHIN THE CAPSULE THERE WERE TWO AREAS OF GRANULOMATOUS TISSUE AND THICK MASS INFEROMEDIALLY. THE CAPSULE AND MASS WERE SENT TO MICROBIOLOGY, CULTURE, AND HISTOPATHOLOGY. ""THE LYMPHOID CELLS WERE HIGHLY ATYPICAL, SHOWING ENLARGED AND IRREGULARLY CONFIGURED NUCLEI. IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS SHOWED CD30 +, ALK-, B-CELL MARKER NEGATIVE, AND T-CELL MARKER PARTIAL AND PATCHILY-POSITIVE (CD3, CD43, CD45RO, AND CD5) TISSUE.

AT THAT TIME, SHE UNDERWENT LEFT MASTECTOMY AND SENTINEL LYMPH NODE BIOPSY IN 2006 WITH NO RECONSTRUCTION. IN (B)(6) 2007, SHE UNDERWENT DELAYED PLACEMENT OF A MENTOR TEXTURED SILTEXT MEDIUM HEIGHT TISSUE EXPANDER (REFERENCE 3584-6215, LOT 5725412, SERIAL NUMBER (B)(4), 650CC VOLUME, INTRAOPERATIVE FILL 180CC SALINE) AND LATISSIMUS DORSI FLAP TO THE LEFT SIDE. SHE UNDERWENT TISSUE EXPANSION AND SUBSEQUENTLY IN (B)(6) 2007, UNDERWENT EXCHANGE OF THE TISSUE EXPANDER FOR A PERMANENT SILICONE TEXTURED MENTOR CPG IMPLANT. CONCURRENTLY, SHE UNDERWENT RIGHT MASTOPEXY AND AUGMENTATION OF SYMMETRY. THE PT'S RECORDS FROM DR (B)(6) WERE REVIEWED AND THE PT HAD A MENTOR CPG 323 SILICONE GEL IMPLANT 685 CC ON THE LEFT (REF 334-1452G) AND MENTOR CPG 323 GEL IMPLANT SIZE 350CC ON THE RIGHT (REF 350-3501BC). IN (B)(6) 2014, SHE NOTICED THAT HER LEFT BREAST WAS SUDDENLY (OVER 1-2 WEEKS) LARGER THAN THE RIGHT. THE FLUID COLLECTION WAS FOUND ON PHYSICAL EXAM. SHE UNDERWENT ASPIRATION OF THE FLUID COLLECTION, WHICH TOTALED 400 CUBIC CENTIMETERS AND WAS CLEAR YELLOW IN OUTPUT, WAS SENT TO PATHOLOGY AND DEMONSTRATED CD30 POSITIVE, ALK NEGATIVE ANAPLASTIC LARGE-CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL) CONSISTENT WITH BREAST IMPLANT ASSOCIATED ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA. ON (B)(6) 2014, SHE UNDERWENT BILATERAL BREAST EXPLANTATION WAS WELL AS BILATERAL TOTAL CAPSULECTOMIES WITH EXTENSIVE CAPSULECTOMY ON THE LEFT SIDE. MARGINS WERE NEGATIVE PER THE PT'S REPORT. THERE WAS NO SUSPICIOUS LYMPHADENOPATHY. THIS WAS DONE BY (B)(6), WHO ALSO DID THE PT'S BREAST RECONSTRUCTION. THERE WAS NO MASS, ONLY ALCL LOCATED WITHIN THE IMPLANT CAPSULE.

5801921|49945348|D|1||"I HAD BREAST AUGMENTATION IN 1998 BY A (B)(6) PLASTIC SURGEON. WITHIN 2 YEARS, I DEVELOPED HASHIMOTO'S AUTOIMMUNE THYROIDITIS. OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, I DEVELOPED CHRONIC FATIGUE, CHRONIC EPSTEIN-BARR, RECURRENT LOW GRADE FEVER, SWOLLEN LYMPH NODES, BRAIN FOG, SKIN NODULES, CHRONIC SINUS INFECTIONS. I WENT FROM DOCTOR TO DOCTOR ABOUT DIFFERENT ISSUES WITHOUT RECEIVING MUCH EXPLANATION FOR MY SYMPTOMS. IN 2012, ONE OF MY SALINE IMPLANTS RUPTURED. I WAS NOT IN A POSITION FINANCIALLY TO REPLACE THEM. I CONTACTED MY ORIGINAL PLASTIC SURGEON IN (B)(64). MY RECORDS HAD BEEN DESTROYED. HE MENTIONED TWO BRANDS OF IMPLANTS THAT HE WAS USING IN 1998. AFTER MY RUPTURE, I SLOWLY DEVELOPED MIGRAINES 1-3 DAYS A WEEK AND ARM AND HAND NUMBNESS. MY FATIGUE WORSENED. MY CONCENTRATION WAS BAD. A FEW MONTHS AFTER THE RUPTURE, I FOUND ONE OF MY ID CARDS, I WAS APPALLED TO FIND OUT THAT I HAD PIP BRAND TEXTURED SALINE IMPLANTS. THIS WAS NOT ONE OF THE BRANDS THAT MY SURGEON MENTIONED ON THE PHONE. THEN I FOUND OUT THAT THE FDA HAD DENIED THEIR APPROVAL IN 2000. I WAS NEVER NOTIFIED BY MY SURGEON OR THE FDA THAT MY IMPLANTS HAD BEEN DENIED APPROVAL. I HAD TO LEAVE MY RUPTURED IMPLANT IN FOR 3 YEARS BEFORE I COULD REMOVE THEM. DURING THAT TIME, I WAS CONSIDERING ALL OF MY OPTIONS. I FOUND A PLASTIC SURGEON IN DALLAS WHO DOES NOT PERFORM BREAST AUGMENTATION BECAUSE HE HAS SEEN SO MANY WOMEN WHO DEVELOPED ILLNESS FROM THEIR BREAST IMPLANTS. HIS LIST OF COMMON SYMPTOMS WENT RIGHT ALONG WITH MY LIST. I FINALLY REMOVED BOTH BREAST IMPLANTS IN (B)(6) 2015. MANY OF MY SYMPTOMS IMMEDIATELY DISAPPEARED. MY LOW GRADE FEVER, ARM AND HAND NUMBNESS, SWOLLEN LYMPH NODES, MIGRAINES, AND BRAIN FOG WENT AWAY IMMEDIATELY AFTER SURGERY. I STILL HAVE HASHIMOTO'S AND I STILL BATTLE FATIGUE. OVERALL, THOUGH, MY HEALTH IS GREATLY IMPROVED. I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT MY IMPLANTS CONTRIBUTED TO MY DECLINING HEALTH. I SENT MY IMPLANTS TO DR. (B)(6) FOR EVAL. THE TEXTURED SURFACE SHOWED MAJOR EROSION AND MY RUPTURED IMPLANT WAS FULL OF CONTAMINANTS. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE PROCESS OF ALLOWING THESE PIP IMPLANTS INTO THE US FOR USE, WHY THE FDA DENIED THEIR APPROVAL, THE REASON THAT I WAS NOT NOTIFIED, AND HOW I CAN OBTAIN THE CHEMICAL MAKEUP OF THESE SALINE PIP IMPLANTS. IT IS WIDELY KNOWN THAT THE SILICONE PIP IMPLANTS USED INTERNATIONALLY WERE MADE WITH INDUSTRIAL GRADE SILICONE AND THEY HAD A HIGH RATE OF RUPTURE. I HAVE MET THOUSANDS OF WOMEN WHO ARE IN THE SAME SITUATION AS ME. THEY TOO HAVE DEVELOPED AUTOIMMUNE ILLNESS AND STRANGE SYMPTOMS AFTER AUGMENTATION. I AM IN NUMEROUS SUPPORT GROUPS FOR THESE WOMEN. I SPEAK OUT PUBLICLY ABOUT IT AND I WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. WE HAVE AN UPCOMING (B)(6) CONFERENCE ON BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESS TO DISCUSS THIS VERY ISSUE. LONG-TERM STUDIES NEED TO BE DONE (15-20 YEAR STUDIES) AND THEY NEED TO BE FOUND BY SOMEONE OTHER THAN THE IMPLANT MFRS. I HAVE MET WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN SUSPICIOUSLY DROPPED FROM THE STUDIES THEY WERE IN. I HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING PUBLICATIONS, MEDICAL JOURNALS, RADIOLOGICAL JOURNALS, ETC., FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS. IT IS APPALLING TO READ SOME OF THESE ARTICLES AND STILL SEE THAT THE FDA LABELS THESE AS SAFE. THE MENTOR MEMORYGEL PHYSICIAN'S LABELING PAMPHLET THAT IS ON THE FDA WEBSITE STATES THAT THE STUDIES INVOLVING A RELATION TO CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDER NEEDS TO BE LARGER (NOT THAT THERE ISN'T A CONNECTION), THAT THE STUDIES INVOLVING NEUROLOGICAL SYMPTOMS ARE INSUFFICIENT OR FLAWED (NOT THAT THERE ISN'T A CONNECTION), AND THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN SYMPTOMS SUCH AS CHRONIC FATIGUE, JOINT PAIN, FIBROMYALGIA, ETC., EVEN WHEN THE IMPLANTS AREN'T DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO A ""DEFINED ILLNESS"". THIS IS THE PAMPHLET FROM THE IMPLANT MFR YET MANY WOMEN SAY THAT THEY WERE NEVER TOLD OF THESE POSSIBLE RISKS. THE SAME PAMPHLET SAYS THAT SILICONE AND PLATINUM CAN MIGRATE THROUGH THE SEMI-PERMEABLE INTACT SHELL YET WE CAN'T GET A LIST OF INGREDIENTS.

5761253|48540699|D|1||I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER IN MY RIGHT BREAST IN (B)(6) 2010. I CONTACTED A BREAST CANCER SURGEON AND SHE TOLD ME I NEEDED TO HAVE A MASTECTOMY SINCE THERE WERE 2 TUMORS IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF MY BREAST. I ALSO CONTACTED A RECONSTRUCTIVE/PLASTIC SURGEON. I AGREED TO HAVE AN IMPLANT PUT IN AT THE SAME TIME AS MY SURGERY. THE PLASTIC SURGEON PUT IN A TISSUE EXPANDER FOR THREE MONTHS AND ON (B)(6) 2011, I HAD AN ALLERGAN TEXTURED BREAST IMPLANT PUT IN. THE STYLE OF THE IMPLANT HAD NOT BEEN APPROVED BY THE FDA YET, SO I SIGNED A CONSENT FORM TO BE PART OF A STUDY. I READ THE AGREEMENT THOROUGHLY AND THERE WERE ONLY TWO POSSIBLE RISKS: INFECTION OR COMPARTMENT CONTRACTURE. THERE WAS NO MENTION OF LYMPHOMA CANCER. APPROXIMATELY 2 YEARS LATER THE FDA APPROVED THIS STYLE IMPLANT AND THE STUDY WAS ENDED. ON (B)(6) 2016 MY RIGHT BREAST BECAME TIGHT AND HARD. IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS IT BECAME LARGER AND LARGER. I CONTACTED MY PLASTIC SURGEON AND SHE ASKED ME TO TAKE A PICTURE OF MY BREAST AND SEND TO HER, SINCE I WAS OUT OF TOWN AT THE TIME. SHE ORDERED AN ANTIBIOTIC AND MADE AN APPOINTMENT FOR ME TO SEE HER THE FOLLOWING WEEK. I WENT TO SEE HER AND SHE TOOK MORE PICTURES AND TOLD ME IT WAS PROBABLY AN INFECTION AND I SHOULD CONTINUE ANTIBIOTIC. MY BREAST GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER AND MY SURGEON DECIDED TO REMOVE MY IMPLANT. DURING THE SURGERY SHE TOOK A TISSUE SAMPLE AND THEN PUT IN A NEW TEXTURED IMPLANT AND CLOSED UP INCISION. ON (B)(6), THE PATHOLOGY REPORT CAME BACK WITH THE DIAGNOSIS OF ALCL. IT WAS CONFIRMED BY A PET CT SCAN. MY SURGEON SAID THAT SHE KNEW THE DOCTOR WHO SPECIALIZED IN ALCL AND THAT HE WAS AT THE (B)(6). MY HUSBAND AND I FLEW TO (B)(6) TO HAVE IMPLANT AND SURROUNDING SCAR TISSUE REMOVED BY THE SURGEONS WHO ARE THE AUTHORITY ON THIS DISEASE. ALSO, THE RESEARCH ON THIS DISEASE IS BEING DONE BY A TEAM THERE. THEY HAVE SEEN MOST OF THE DIAGNOSED CASES IN THE US. I HAD OTHER TESTS DONE THERE: AN ULTRASOUND AND A CHEST X-RAY. I SPOKE WITH THE DOCTOR AND HE TOLD ME THAT THE LYMPHOMA WAS ONLY IN THE FLUID SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT AND NOT IN THE SCAR TISSUE (CAPSULE) OR IN MY LYMPH NODES. I HAD THE SURGERY ON (B)(6) 2016 AND WAS INFORMED THAT ALL OF THE CANCER CELLS WERE REMOVED AND I WAS NOW CANCER FREE. I DECIDED TO HAVE A SMOOTH SILICONE IMPLANT PUT IN DURING THE SURGERY RATHER THAN COME BACK LATER FOR ADDITIONAL RECONSTRUCTION. THE DOCTOR TOLD ME THAT NONE OF THE ALCL CASES HAD EVER INVOLVED A SMOOTH IMPLANT.

DEVICE HISTORY REVIEW (DHR) SUMMARY: REVIEW OF DHR FOR WORK ORDER (B)(4) DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY DEVIATIONS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS OR NON-CONFORMANCES DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. ALL GEL BREAST IMPLANTS WERE REVIEWED AS PART OF THE ASSEMBLY OPERATIONS AND THESE TASKS WERE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO APPLICABLE CURRENT PROCEDURES TO ENSURE THAT ASSEMBLY MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. DHR FOR WORK ORDER (B)(4) INDICATES THAT THERE WAS A REPROCESS ON THE PRIMARY PACKAGING OPERATION IN WHICH THE REPORTED DEVICE WAS REPROCESSED HOWEVER REVIEW OF THE REPROCESS OF WORK ORDER (B)(4) DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY DEVIATIONS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS OR NON-CONFORMANCES THAT MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE REPORTED DEVICE EVENT. THE DHR ASSEMBLY REPORT FROM SAP WAS VERIFIED AND THERE WAS NOT ANY SCRAP RELATED WITH REPORTED EVENT, ALL DEVICES WERE CONFORMANCE DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. IN ADDITION, DHR FOR SHELL RUN NUMBER (B)(4) DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY DEVIATIONS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS OR NON-CONFORMANCES DURING SHELL FABRICATION PROCESS. ALL SHELLS WERE REVIEWED AS PART OF THE SHELL FABRICATION OPERATIONS AND THESE TASKS WERE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO APPLICABLE CURRENT PROCEDURES TO ENSURE THAT FABRICATION MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS.

ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.

I CONSULTED WITH TWO DOCTORS THAT SPECIALIZE IN EXPLANT AND AMAZINGLY, THEY WERE ABLE TO TELL ME MY SYMPTOMS. IN 2014, I HAD AN EXPLANT AND LYMPH NODE DISSECTION OF SILICON INFILTRATED LYMPH NODES. I WAS TOLD THAT THOUGH MY IMPLANTS WERE INTACT, THE OUTER TEXTURED SHELL HAD BEEN FLAKING OFF. I HAD ANOTHER LYMPH NODE DISSECTION IN 2015 AND KNOW THAT I NOW ADD'L NODES WITH SILICON IN THEM NOW. ULTRASOUND WENT AWAY IMMEDIATELY POST EXPLANT AND OTHERS TOOK A COUPLE OF MONTHS, BUT I WOULD SAY THAT I AM GENERALLY ABOUT 85% BETTER. THIS WHOLE ORDEAL HAS LEFT ME WITH NO TOLERANCE FOR MOLD AND I AM NOT ABLE TO TAKE ANTIBIOTICS (WITHOUT TAKING AN ANTIFUNGAL AS WELL). THE LAST TWO YEARS HAVE BEEN A BIT OF A ROLLER COASTER. THOUGH SOMETIMES I AM OKAY, I HAVE BEEN LEFT WITH AUTO-IMMUNE ISSUES SWOLLEN JOINTS, DRY EYES, RASHES AND FATIGUE. SYMPTOMS GET WORSE WHEN EXPOSED TO ANY TYPE OF MOLD, AND BETTER WHEN ON ANTI-FUNGAL. THE IMPLANTS BASICALLY STARTED TO DISINTEGRATE IN MY BODY. IF THEY WERE NOT GOING TO LAST 20 YEARS, LIKE I WAS INITIALLY TOLD WHEN I CHOSE TO HAVE RECONSTRUCTION, I SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MENTOR OR THE FDA AND CHANGED THEIR MIND AND THIS WAS NO LONGER THE CASE. MY ADDRESS AND PHONE NUMBER FROM THE ADJUNCT STUDY ARE STILL THE SAME. NOTE I WAS TAKING NONE OF THESE OTC MEDS PRIOR TO EXPLANT."|SILTEX BECKER 50 EXPANDER/MAMMARY PROSTHESIS||07/22/2016||||Y|*||I|FTR|2.0||SILTEX BECKER 50 EXPANDER/MAMMARY PROSTHESIS||231377|||||MENTOR|||||354-2020||False|False|True|True

5801905|49945687|D|1||OVER THE LAST 15 YEARS MY HEALTH HAS DECLINED. THE FIRST 10 OF THOSE YEARS I DEVELOPED FATIGUE, HORMONAL IMBALANCES, REOCCURRING YEAST INFECTIONS, ACNE AND RANDOM PAIN THROUGHOUT MY BODY ALONG WITH VARIOUS OTHER UNEXPLAINED AILMENTS. THESE SYMPTOMS CONTINUALLY GOT WORSE AND MORE SYMPTOMS STARTED OCCURRING. THE PAST 4 YEARS I BEGIN HAVING SO MUCH PAIN IN MY FEET AND LEGS THAT I COULD BARELY WALK. I WAS TESTED FOR PLANTARS FASCIITIS WHICH CAME BACK NEGATIVE, PHYSICAL THERAPY AND CHIROPRACTIC APPOINTMENTS BECAUSE WAS TOLD POSSIBLE NERVE PINCH IN LOWER BACK. THREE YEARS AGO THE PAIN CREPT UP INTO MY HANDS AND ARMS AND CONTINUING THROUGHOUT MY WHOLE BODY FEELING AS THOUGH SOMEONE HAD DUMPED CHEMICAL ACID ON MY BODY TO THE POINT ALL I COULD DO IS LAY IN BED AT NIGHT AND WISH I WOULD DIE. IN APPROX (B)(6) 2014, MY WHOLE BODY DECIDED TO REACT BY NOT BEING UNABLE TO REGULATE ITS BODY TEMPERATURE, EXTREME DIZZINESS TO THE POINT OF BLACKOUTS, EXTREME FATIGUE TO WHERE I BARELY COULD FUNCTION FOR A FEW HOURS THEN WOULD HAVE TO SLEEP, I FELT AS THOUGH I WAS SUFFOCATING ALL THE TIME, MY HANDS BEGAN SHAKING TO THE POINT I COULD NOT HOLD MY PHONE OR A GLASS. I COULD NOT THINK CLEARLY AND WAS HAVING EXTREME MEMORY LOSS, I WENT FROM HAVING 20/20 VISION TO NEEDING TRIFOCALS IN A MATTER OF LESS THAN A YEAR. THE PAIN IN MY BODY GOT WORSE AND NEVER LET UP. I HAVE TO KEEP MY HOME AT ABOUT 68 DEGREES BECAUSE HEAT MAKES THE CHEMICAL ACID BURNING INCREASE 10 FOLD, I HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME LEAVING MY HOME BECAUSE I LIVE IN THE DESERT AND THE SUN LITERALLY MAKES MY SKIN FEEL AS THOUGH IT IS BLISTERING. BETWEEN (B)(6) 2014 AND (B)(6) 2015 I LOST (B)(6) POUNDS UNEXPLAINABLY. ON (B)(6) 2015 MY PRIMARY PHYSICIAN WROTE ME OUT OF WORK FOR A WEEK THEN 2 WEEKS THEN FOR AN UNDETERMINED AMOUNT OF TIME AND SAID I NEEDED TO SEE A NEUROLOGIST. I FOLLOWED UP WITH A NEUROLOGIST WHO SAID HE BELIEVED I HAD PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY, BUT PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY DID NOT FIT ALL THE SYMPTOMS I WAS HAVING. AT THIS POINT I STARTED GOING TO THE (B)(6) CLINIC IN LATE (B)(6) 2015 WHO BY JUST MY SYMPTOMS FIGURED I HAD EITHER LUPUS, MS, HODGKIN'S DISEASE, LYME DISEASE OR SOME OTHER AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE. THEY PERFORMED MULTIPLE MRI'S, CAT SCANS, PET SCANS, BLOOD AND URINE TESTS, NERVE TESTS, HEART TESTS, LUNG TESTS AND MANY OTHER TESTS TO TRY AND DETERMINE WHY I WAS SICK. THEY DID DETERMINE THAT MY BLOOD PRESSURE WAS EXTREMELY LOW AND WOULD BOTTOM OUT IF I STOOD OR MOVE TOO QUICKLY CAUSING THE DIZZINESS AND BLACKOUTS. WHICH IS OPPOSITE OF WHAT I WAS 4 YEARS AGO TAKING MEDICINE FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. THEY DETERMINED I HAD EARLY STAGES OF EMPHYSEMA AND COPD. THE PET SCAN SHOWED NO TYPE OF CANCER, AND MY BLOOD WORK CAME BACK FINE OTHER THAN MY C-REACTIVE PROTEIN WAS AT 18. AT THIS POINT THEY DETERMINED I HAD AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE FOR UNK REASONS WITH SMALL FIBER NEUROPATHY. NONE OF THE MEDICATIONS OR THE INTERVENOUS STEROIDS RELIEVED MY SYMPTOMS. IN (B)(6) 2015, MY DAUGHTER DISCOVERED WHAT IS KNOWN AS BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESS. ALL THE SYMPTOMS LISTED FOR THIS WAS WHAT I WAS DEALING WITH. I HAD MY IMPLANTS REMOVED (B)(6) ENBLOCK STYLE WITH CAPSULES COMPLETELY REMOVED. SINCE THIS TIME I HAVE STEADILY FELT MY HEALTH RETURNING. SINCE SURGERY MY MEMORY HAS GOTTEN BETTER ALONG WITH WHAT I CALL THE BRAIN FOG, THE PAIN ALL OVER MY BODY HAS LESSENED TO MAYBE AN 8 INSTEAD OF A 10, THE SHAKING ONLY OCCURS ONCE IN AWHILE. I AM FAR FROM BEING BETTER, BUT I CAN TELL I AM AT LEAST RECOVERING SLOWLY.|MENTOR TEXTURED BREAST IMPLANTS||07/13/2016||||*|*||I|FWM|0.0||BREAST IMPLANTS|||||||MENTOR|||||||True|False|False|True

BREAST AUGMENTATION WAS DONE 11 YEARS PREVIOUSLY WITH SUBGLANDULAR PLACEMENT OF ALLERGAN TEXTURIZED PROSTHESES THROUGH THE INFRAMAMMARY APPROACH. THE BREAST AUGMENTATION WAS DONE ELSEWHERE.

AT PHYSICAL EXAMINATION BREAST ASYMMETRY WAS OBVIOUS. THE RIGHT BREAST WAS SWOLLEN, FIRM AND SENSITIVE TO DEEP PALPATION. THE LEFT BREAST WAS NORMAL. NO SIGN OF LOCAL INFECTION WERE OBSERVED. IN (B)(6) 2015, AN ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA WAS FOUND IN THE PERIPROSTHETIC FLUID AND FIBRINOID DEPOSITS WITHIN THE PERIPROSTHETIC CAPSULE, OF THE RIGHT BREAST. THE LEFT BREAST WAS WITHOUT ANY CLINICAL, LAB, IMAGING OR HISTOPATHOLOGICAL EVIDENCE OF DISEASE. ON (B)(6) 2015, THE PT UNDERWENT BILATERAL TOTAL CAPSULECTOMY AND IMPLANT REMOVAL. NOW, MORE THAN A YEAR AFTER, THE PT IS DISEASE FREE.
