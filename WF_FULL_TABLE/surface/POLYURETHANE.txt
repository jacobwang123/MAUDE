WENT TO SEE MY PLASTIC SURGEON AND HE REFERRED ME TO THE ONE OF THE FINEST BREAST SURGEONS. WENT TO SEE HIM FIRST OF JANUARY AND HE SCHEDULED ME FOR A BIOPSY ON 1/13/92 AND WHEN WE GOT THE REPORT BACK IT WAS CANCEROUS AND SO I WENT TO SEE HIM THE NEXT DAY AND WE DISCUSSED THE DIFFERENT PROCEDURES, ETC. AND HE BOOKED ME FOR SURGERY ON 1/21/1992. I OPTED FOR A MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY BECAUSE I DID HAVE THE SILICONE IMPLANT IN THE BREAST AND WAS DEVASTED WITH THE FACT THAT I HAD CANCER. I HAD THIS PROCEDURE AND HAD THE SAME PLASTIC SURGEON DO THE RECONSTRUCTION WITH A SALINE EXPANDER. THE VERY NEXT MORNING THE PLASTIC SURGEON TOLD ME AT THE HOSP THAT HE WAS SURE THE SALINE HAD RUPTURED AND TO CALL HIM THE FOLLOWING WEEK TO SET UP AN APPOINTMENT TO REPLACE THE SALINE, WHICH I DID. FOLLOWING THIS SALINE IMPLANT I HAD SEVERE REJECTION AND CONTRACTURES WHICH ONCE AGAIN THE IMPLANT STARTED TO MOVE UPWARDS. WENT BACK TO PLASTIC SURGEON WE DISCUSSED THE PAST IMPLANT HISTORY AND THAT THE POLYURETHANE COATED IMPLANTS SEEM TO BE THE ONLY ONES WHICH WORKED. THAT THIS WOULD BE THE ONLY OPTION BUT THAT I HAD TO SIGN A WAIVER. HE NEVER AT ANY TIME INFORMED ME OF THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OR HEALTH RISK INVOLVED WITH THESE TYPES OF IMPLANTS, BUT I HAD NO INFO FROM THE MFR OR INFO REGARDING THESE IMPLANTS NOR DID I KNOW THAT THE FDA STOPPED THE MFRS FROM MAKING THE POLYURETHANE IMPLANTS UNTIL I REQUEST THE BREAST IMPLANT, 1998 FROM THE FDA. I HAD STARTED TO HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS: SKIN RASHES, ALLERGIES, REDNESS, JOINT SWELLING AND SUSPECTED THAT THIS WAS FROM A SEVERE ALLERGY FROM POLYURETHANE COATING, ITCHNESS WITHIN BREAST ESPECIALLY MY LEFT BREAST (MASTY. BREAST). THIS WENT ON FOR OVER SIX YEARS. WENT FROM DR TO DR TO SPECIALIST BACK TO MY OWN DRS, ONCOLOGIST, INTERNIST, GYN, PLASTIC SURGEON AND GOT NO REAL INFO. ALSO HAD SEVERE PAINS IN BOTH BREASTS, CONTRACTIONS. FINALLY IN JUNE OF 1998 AFTER SEEING 11 DERMATOLOGISTS, 2 ALLERGISTS, ETC., I WENT TO SEE MY ONCOLOGIST AND ASKED FOR AN MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING BREAST TEST AND I HAD ONE DONE ON 7/2/98. RESULTS OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING STATE THAT REACTIVE FLUID CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, AND CONTAINED OTHER INFO. I HAD THESE FAXED TO ALL MY DRS, NO ONE GAVE ME ANY INFO REGARDING THIS MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING TEST. WENT AND SAW DRS ONCE AGAIN! GOT NOWHERE; TOLD THEM I THOUGHT IMPLANTS WERE CAUSE OF MY BEING ILL. RASHES, ALLERGIES ARE WORSE THAN MY RIGHT BREAST ENLARGED TO ABOUT TWO SIZES LARGER, RED RASHES, ITCHY, VEINS POPPING, EXTREME PAIN, FEVER IN LEFT BREAST, AND OTHER SYMPTOMS WERE MISSING IN RIGHT BREAST WHEN I DISCOVERED A LUMP UNDER MY RIGHT ARMPIT. CALLED MY BREAST SURGEON GOT AN APPOINTMENT 10/9/98, AND HE GAVE ME ANTIOBIOTICS BUT GAVE ME AN APPOINTMENT AT HIS MEDICAL SUITE TO HAVE A BIOPSY ON 10/14/98. HE REMOVED MY LYMPH NODE AND AFTER PATHOLOGIST REPORT CAME IN AS BENIGN. OTHER REPORTS WERE NOT IN AND I CALLED TO HAVE THEM FAX THE RESULTS AND IT SHOWED I HAD FOREIGN MATERIAL CONSISTENT WITH SILICONE AND THERE WAS A TAN FLESHY SUBSTANCE IN THE RIGHT AUXILLARY LYMPH NODE AND ALSO GIANT REACTIVE FLUID PRESENT, ETC. I FAXED THIS INFO TO MY ONCOLOGIST, PLASTIC SURGEON, WENT TO SEE THEM BUT NOTHING AS FAR AS WHAT I KNEW WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS AND THEIR CONCLUSIONS. FOUND OUT WHO WAS THE MEDICAL ADVISOR AND DIRECTOR FOR CANCER AT THE HOSP WHERE I RESIDE AND WENT TO SEE A DR ON 12/3/98 WITH MY HISTORY. HE JUST CONSULTS AND HE AFTER GOING THROUGH ALL THE PAPERS AND DOCUMENTS I BROUGHT IN CONCURRED WITH ME THAT I NEEDED TO HAVE MY IMPLANTS REMOVED AND RECOMMENDED AND SENT MY INFO TO A DR. APPOINTMENT SET FOR 3/1/99. ALSO GOT IN TOUCH WITH WOMEN IN THE IMPLANT TASK FORCE IN THE BACK OF THE BREAST IMPLANT UPDATED 1998 BOOK AND THEY RECOMMENDED A DR."|UNIMED POLYURETHANE - COATED PROSTHESES|UNK|02/23/1999|A||*|Y||205138.0|0HP|FTR|3.0||POLYURETHANE - COATED SILICONE IMPLANTS|Y|UNK|2317 EATON LN||RACINE|US|MEDICAL ENGINEERING CORP A BRISTOL MYERS SQUIBB CO.||WI|53404||UNK|LEFT|True|True|True|True

THESE IMPLANTS WERE SUPPOSEDLY REMOVED IN 1992, HOWEVER, IN 2001 THE REMAINING AMOUNTS OF THIS SUBSTANCE (THAT COULD BE REMOVED) WERE REMOVED FROM MY CHEST AND LYMPH NODES. MUCH OF IT STILL REMAINS IN MY BODY AS IT COULD NOT BE REMOVED UNLESS MY ENTIRE CHEST WAS OPENED SUCH AS IN OPEN HEART SURGERY! I AM SICK, I HAVE REPORTED NUMEROUS PROBLEMS DUE TO THESE IMPLANTS OVER THE PAST 15 OR SO YRS AND STILL THE FDA AND OTHER AGENCIES THAT COULD DO SOMETHING HAVE DONE NOTHING TO PREVENT THESE TYPES OF PROBLEMS FROM HAPPENING. SUCH AS: MS, LUPUS, FIBROMYALGIA, SEVERE MIGRAINES, INSOMNIA, A GOOEY AND STICKY SUBSTANCE COMING FROM MY NOSE, EARS, THROAT AND CHEST, BONE DEGENERATION AND MANY, MANY OTHER PROBLEMS.

4226462|5066253|D|1||I AM COMPLETING THIS QUESTIONNAIRE AT THE REQUEST OF THE (B)(6). IN 1989 I RECEIVED A SET OF SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS WHICH WERE COATED IN POLYURETHANE TO PREVENT SCAR TISSUE FROM BUILDING UP AFTER BILATERAL MASTECTOMIES FOR BREAST CANCER. AT THE TIME, I WAS WORKING AT (B)(6) BUT LEFT FOR (B)(6). SHORTLY AFTER, MY CHEST WAS INFLAMED, SWOLLEN, HOT AND I HAD TROUBLE BREATHING. I HAD AN MRI AT (B)(6) THAT SHOWED THE POLYURETHANE HAD TURNED INTO A LIQUID AND HAD INVADED AND ENGULFED MY HEART, LUNGS, AND CHEST LYMPH NODES. UNDERWENT ALMOST TWO YEARS OF DEBRIDEMENT PRIOR TO HAVING BILATERAL LATISSIMUS FLAP SURGERY. THE POLYURETHANE WAS FOUND IN MY PERICARDIUM AND PERICARDIAL FLUID ALONG WITH MY LYMPH NODES TO INCLUDE THE INTERNAL RIGHT MAMMARY LYMPH NODE WHICH BEGAN TO ENLARGE. I WAS TOLD TO LEAVE IT ALONE AND TO WATCH SINCE NO ONE KNEW WHAT THE OUTCOME WOULD BE AND THAT IT IS IN A DIFFICULT POSITION TO GET A BIOPSY. OVER THE YEARS I HAVE HAD SEVERAL BREAST MRI'S AT VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO INCLUDE (B)(6). WAS TOLD MY CHEST LIGHTS UP LIKE A CHRISTMAS TREE FROM THE POLYURETHANE. THE MOST WORRISOME IS THE RIGHT INTERNAL LYMPH NODE WHICH HAS STEADILY INCREASED IN SIZE AND IS NOW ABOUT 10 CM. (WILL BE HAVING A CHEST CAT SCAN ON THURSDAY TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY) SINCE WE ARE IN THE MILITARY, WE HAVE MOVED SEVERAL TIMES AND NO ONE IS FAMILIAR WITH THIS PROBLEM. LOOKING AT A (B)(6), I HAVE FOUND THAT I AM AT RISK FOR LYMPHOMA DUE TO THE POLYURETHANE. NOT SURE WHAT TO DO NEXT OR WHAT THE OUTCOME WILL BE. PLEASE FORWARD ANY INFO YOU MAY HAVE ON THIS PROBLEM. THAN YOU, (B)(6).|BREAST IMPLANT||10/28/2014|||||||0|FTR|1.0||BREAST IMPLANT|||||||nan|||||||False|False|True|True
