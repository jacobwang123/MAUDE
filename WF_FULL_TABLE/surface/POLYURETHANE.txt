WENT BACK TO THE PLASTIC SURGEON AND WE DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITIES AND HE SUGGESTED I HAVE IT REPLACED WITH THE SAME POLYURETHANE IMPLANT WHICH HE HAD PUT IN, ON 7/6/90, RIGHT AND LEFT BREAST AFTER TAKING THE TWO SILICONES OUT FOR THE SAME REASONS. HE SAID THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE THE FORMATION OF THE SCAR TISSUE WITH THE CAPSULAR CONTRACTIONS. THIS IS HOW I WAS GIVEN A POLYURETHANE COATED IMPLANT IN MY LEFT BREAST (CANCER SIDE - MASTECTOMY). HISTORY: IN 1988 WENT TO SEE THIS PLASTIC SURGEON WHO WAS REFERRED TO ME TO SEE IF HE COULD POSSIBLY STITCH BOTH MY BREASTS UP FOR THEY HAD BECOME EMPTY SACS AFTER I STOPPED MENSTRUATING AND HIS SOLUTION WAS TO AUGMENT THEM AND AFTER CONSIDERATION HE DID AND PUT IN TWO SILICONE IMPLANTS. IN TIME THESE STARTED TO GIVE ME PAIN AND HAD CAPSULAR CONTRACTIONS AND THEY STARTED RIDING HIGH AND THEY WERE SO SEVERE THAT HE SUGGESTED THAT WITH HIS PTS WITH THIS PROBLEM HE OPTED FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE SILICONE AND REPLACE THEM WITH 2 POLYURETHANE IMPLANTS WHICH WOULD ADHERE BETTER AND YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SUCH CONTRACTIONS. I DID THIS AND HAD THIS PROCEDURE PERFORMED AT HIS SURGICAL SUITE ON 7/2/90. SEE NOTES AT END OF HISTORY OF IMPLANTS. HAD REGULAR MAMMOGRAMS AND IN THE LATTER PART OF 1991 I WAS FEELING A LUMP IN MY LEFT BREAST EVEN THOUGH THE LATEST MAMMOGRAM DID NOT SHOW ANYTHING. I REQUESTED ANOTHER MAMMOGRAM AT A DIFFERENT LOCATION AND THIS SHOWED NOTHING. ASKED MY DR IF I COULD HAVE A WRITTEN PRESCRIPTION TO HAVE A SONOGRAM PERFORMED AND I DID AND SURE ENOUGH I DID HAVE A LUMP. WENT TO SEE MY PLASTIC SURGEON AND HE REFERRED ME TO THE ONE OF THE FINEST BREAST SURGEONS. WENT TO SEE HIM FIRST OF JANUARY AND HE SCHEDULED ME FOR A BIOPSY ON 1/13/92 AND WHEN WE GOT THE REPORT BACK IT WAS CANCEROUS AND SO I WENT TO SEE HIM THE NEXT DAY AND WE DISCUSSED THE DIFFERENT PROCEDURES, ETC. AND HE BOOKED ME FOR SURGERY ON 1/21/1992. I OPTED FOR A MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY BECAUSE I DID HAVE THE SILICONE IMPLANT IN THE BREAST AND WAS DEVASTED WITH THE FACT THAT I HAD CANCER. I HAD THIS PROCEDURE AND HAD THE SAME PLASTIC SURGEON DO THE RECONSTRUCTION WITH A SALINE EXPANDER. THE VERY NEXT MORNING THE PLASTIC SURGEON TOLD ME AT THE HOSP THAT HE WAS SURE THE SALINE HAD RUPTURED AND TO CALL HIM THE FOLLOWING WEEK TO SET UP AN APPOINTMENT TO REPLACE THE SALINE, WHICH I DID. FOLLOWING THIS SALINE IMPLANT I HAD SEVERE REJECTION AND CONTRACTURES WHICH ONCE AGAIN THE IMPLANT STARTED TO MOVE UPWARDS. WENT BACK TO PLASTIC SURGEON WE DISCUSSED THE PAST IMPLANT HISTORY AND THAT THE POLYURETHANE COATED IMPLANTS SEEM TO BE THE ONLY ONES WHICH WORKED. THAT THIS WOULD BE THE ONLY OPTION BUT THAT I HAD TO SIGN A WAIVER. HE NEVER AT ANY TIME INFORMED ME OF THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OR HEALTH RISK INVOLVED WITH THESE TYPES OF IMPLANTS, BUT I HAD NO INFO FROM THE MFR OR INFO REGARDING THESE IMPLANTS NOR DID I KNOW THAT THE FDA STOPPED THE MFRS FROM MAKING THE POLYURETHANE IMPLANTS UNTIL I REQUEST THE BREAST IMPLANT, 1998 FROM THE FDA. I HAD STARTED TO HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS: SKIN RASHES, ALLERGIES, REDNESS, JOINT SWELLING AND SUSPECTED THAT THIS WAS FROM A SEVERE ALLERGY FROM POLYURETHANE COATING, ITCHNESS WITHIN BREAST ESPECIALLY MY LEFT BREAST (MASTY. BREAST). THIS WENT ON FOR OVER SIX YEARS. WENT FROM DR TO DR TO SPECIALIST BACK TO MY OWN DRS, ONCOLOGIST, INTERNIST, GYN, PLASTIC SURGEON AND GOT NO REAL INFO. ALSO HAD SEVERE PAINS IN BOTH BREASTS, CONTRACTIONS. FINALLY IN JUNE OF 1998 AFTER SEEING 11 DERMATOLOGISTS, 2 ALLERGISTS, ETC., I WENT TO SEE MY ONCOLOGIST AND ASKED FOR AN MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING BREAST TEST AND I HAD ONE DONE ON 7/2/98. RESULTS OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING STATE THAT REACTIVE FLUID CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, AND CONTAINED OTHER INFO. I HAD THESE FAXED TO ALL MY DRS, NO ONE GAVE ME ANY INFO REGARDING THIS MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING TEST. WENT AND SAW DRS ONCE AGAIN! GOT NOWHERE; TOLD THEM I THOUGHT IMPLANTS WERE CAUSE OF MY BEING ILL. RASHES, ALLERGIES ARE WORSE THAN MY RIGHT BREAST ENLARGED TO ABOUT TWO SIZES LARGER, RED RASHES, ITCHY, VEINS POPPING, EXTREME PAIN, FEVER IN LEFT BREAST, AND OTHER SYMPTOMS WERE MISSING IN RIGHT BREAST WHEN I DISCOVERED A LUMP UNDER MY RIGHT ARMPIT. CALLED MY BREAST SURGEON GOT AN APPOINTMENT 10/9/98, AND HE GAVE ME ANTIOBIOTICS BUT GAVE ME AN APPOINTMENT AT HIS MEDICAL SUITE TO HAVE A BIOPSY ON 10/14/98. HE REMOVED MY LYMPH NODE AND AFTER PATHOLOGIST REPORT CAME IN AS BENIGN. OTHER REPORTS WERE NOT IN AND I CALLED TO HAVE THEM FAX THE RESULTS AND IT SHOWED I HAD FOREIGN MATERIAL CONSISTENT WITH SILICONE AND THERE WAS A TAN FLESHY SUBSTANCE IN THE RIGHT AUXILLARY LYMPH NODE AND ALSO GIANT REACTIVE FLUID PRESENT, ETC. I FAXED THIS INFO TO MY ONCOLOGIST, PLASTIC SURGEON, WENT TO SEE THEM BUT NOTHING AS FAR AS WHAT I KNEW WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS AND THEIR CONCLUSIONS. FOUND OUT WHO WAS THE MEDICAL ADVISOR AND DIRECTOR FOR CANCER AT THE HOSP WHERE I RESIDE AND WENT TO SEE A DR ON 12/3/98 WITH MY HISTORY. HE JUST CONSULTS AND HE AFTER GOING THROUGH ALL THE PAPERS AND DOCUMENTS I BROUGHT IN CONCURRED WITH ME THAT I NEEDED TO HAVE MY IMPLANTS REMOVED AND RECOMMENDED AND SENT MY INFO TO A DR. APPOINTMENT SET FOR 3/1/99. ALSO GOT IN TOUCH WITH WOMEN IN THE IMPLANT TASK FORCE IN THE BACK OF THE BREAST IMPLANT UPDATED 1998 BOOK AND THEY RECOMMENDED A DR."|UNIMED POLYURETHANE - COATED PROSTHESES|UNK|02/23/1999|A||*|Y||205138.0|0HP|FTR|3.0||POLYURETHANE - COATED SILICONE IMPLANTS|Y|UNK|2317 EATON LN||RACINE|US|MEDICAL ENGINEERING CORP A BRISTOL MYERS SQUIBB CO.||WI|53404||UNK|LEFT|True|True|True|True

387531|272532|D|1||PT HAS HAD THE IMPLANTS FOR TWENTY YEARS. THE REASON THEY CHOSE TO GET IMPLANTS WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE STABBED IN THE CHEST AND LITERALLY LOST MOST OF THEIR BREAST TISSUE ON THE LEFT SIDE.

PT BREASTFED ALL THREE OF THEIR CHILDREN AND SO FAR THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS ANY PROBLEMS HAS A SPASTIC COLON SINCE BIRTH BUT IT IS NOT SERIOUS AT THIS TIME AND PT CANNOT BLAME THIS ON THE IMPLANTS. PT DOES AT TIMES HAVE A LITTLE PAIN IN THEIR BREAST AND SOME SORENESS AROUND THEIR PERIODS. PT MASSAGES THEIR BREAST ATLEAST ONCE A DAY AND HAS SINCE THE IMPLANT SURGERY AS DIRECTED BY THE PHYSICIAN AT THE TIME. PT HAS NOTICED THAT THEIR LEFT BREAST HAS BEGUN TO SAG A LITTLE. PT HAS STARTED TO HAVE SOME JOINT PAIN AND PAIN IN NECK THAT THEY CANNOT EXPLAIN. PT HAS SEVERAL LUMPS OVER THEIR BODY, SMALL ONES THAT STAY SORE. THEIR ARM HAS ONE SMALL LUMP AND THEY HAVE TWO IN THE BACK AND AROUND FIVE IN THE LEGS. THEY ARE VERY SMALL AND ARE SORE TO THE TOUCH. PT HAS, OVER THE COURSE OF TEN YEARS, DEVELOPED CHERRY MOLES ALL OVER THEIR BODY AND THEY ARE GETTING WORSE. PT HAS SHARP PAINS IN THE NECK AT TIMES AND IT IS A VERY SHARP PAIN BUT THEY CANNOT BLAME ANY OF THIS ON THE IMPLANT BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO PROOF. PT READ ARTICLES SENT IN AND SYMPATHETIC TO THOSE WHO ARE HAVING PROBLEMS AND SOME OF THEIR SYMPTOMS MATCH PT'S BUT PT HAS NO PROOF AS YET. PT IS CONCERNED ABOUT THIS PROBLEM BUT THEY CANNOT AFFORD THE NECESSARY TEST NEEDED TO HELP THEM. PT HAS HAD REGULAR MAMMOGRAMS AND THEY SO FAR SHOW NO LEAKAGE. PT'S IMPLANTS WERE PLACED BEHIND THE PECTORAL MUSCLE ALSO. PT HAS ENJOYED THEIR IMPLANTS AND THEY THANK GOD THEY WERE HERE WHEN THEY LOST THEIR SELF ESTEEM BUT PT HAS BEEN AFRAID BECAUSE OF THE REPORTS THEY ARE HEARING AND PT IS A SINGLE PARENT WORKING TWO JOBS TO SUPPORT THEMSELF AND THEIR THREE CHILDREN. PT DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WOULD DO IF THEY HAVE TO HAVE THEM REMOVED BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO DO IT. PT DOESN'T WANT TO LOSE THEIR SELF ESTEEM AGAIN BY NOT HAVING THEIR LEFT BREAST. PT IS WRITING TO INFORM OF SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THEY ARE HAVING BUT AGAIN THEY DO NOT KNOW IF IT IS FROM THE IMPLANTS OR OLD AGE.

IN 1989 I RECEIVED A SET OF SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS WHICH WERE COATED IN POLYURETHANE TO PREVENT SCAR TISSUE FROM BUILDING UP AFTER BILATERAL MASTECTOMIES FOR BREAST CANCER. AT THE TIME, I WAS WORKING AT (B)(6) BUT LEFT FOR (B)(6). SHORTLY AFTER, MY CHEST WAS INFLAMED, SWOLLEN, HOT AND I HAD TROUBLE BREATHING. I HAD AN MRI AT (B)(6) THAT SHOWED THE POLYURETHANE HAD TURNED INTO A LIQUID AND HAD INVADED AND ENGULFED MY HEART, LUNGS, AND CHEST LYMPH NODES. UNDERWENT ALMOST TWO YEARS OF DEBRIDEMENT PRIOR TO HAVING BILATERAL LATISSIMUS FLAP SURGERY. THE POLYURETHANE WAS FOUND IN MY PERICARDIUM AND PERICARDIAL FLUID ALONG WITH MY LYMPH NODES TO INCLUDE THE INTERNAL RIGHT MAMMARY LYMPH NODE WHICH BEGAN TO ENLARGE. I WAS TOLD TO LEAVE IT ALONE AND TO WATCH SINCE NO ONE KNEW WHAT THE OUTCOME WOULD BE AND THAT IT IS IN A DIFFICULT POSITION TO GET A BIOPSY. OVER THE YEARS I HAVE HAD SEVERAL BREAST MRI'S AT VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO INCLUDE (B)(6). WAS TOLD MY CHEST LIGHTS UP LIKE A CHRISTMAS TREE FROM THE POLYURETHANE. THE MOST WORRISOME IS THE RIGHT INTERNAL LYMPH NODE WHICH HAS STEADILY INCREASED IN SIZE AND IS NOW ABOUT 10 CM. (WILL BE HAVING A CHEST CAT SCAN ON THURSDAY TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY) SINCE WE ARE IN THE MILITARY, WE HAVE MOVED SEVERAL TIMES AND NO ONE IS FAMILIAR WITH THIS PROBLEM. LOOKING AT A (B)(6), I HAVE FOUND THAT I AM AT RISK FOR LYMPHOMA DUE TO THE POLYURETHANE. NOT SURE WHAT TO DO NEXT OR WHAT THE OUTCOME WILL BE. PLEASE FORWARD ANY INFO YOU MAY HAVE ON THIS PROBLEM.
