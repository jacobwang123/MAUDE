IT WAS REPORTED THAT A (B)(6) YEAR-OLD WOMAN WITH MASTECTOMY AND AXILLARY DISSECTION (2004) FOR LYMPH NODE-FREE LOBULAR CARCINOMA OF HER RIGHT BREAST WAS IN COMPLETE REMISSION FOR 11 YEARS. SHE UNDERWENT RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY WITH BILATERAL ALLERGAN IMPLANTS IN 2005, REPLACED BY MENTOR IMPLANTS IN 2008. A MODERATELY-LARGE LEFT PERI-PROSTHETIC EFFUSION SEEN BY MRI IN 2012 CONTAINED NON-ATYPICAL LYMPHOCYTES AND MACROPHAGES IN A PROTEINACEOUS BACKGROUND, AND WAS CYTOLOGICALLY INTERPRETED AS A SEROMA. SHE HAD TWO OTHER SEROMAS OF HER RIGHT BREAST (2013) THAT SPONTANEOUSLY REGRESSED WITHOUT EVACUATION. ON (B)(6) 2015, SHE COMPLAINED OF PAIN AND SWELLING OF HER RIGHT BREAST. A LARGE PERI-IMPLANT EFFUSION SUSPICIOUS OF AN INFLAMMATORY PROCESS BY ULTRASOUND WAS COMPLETELY DRAINED BY FNA, RECOVERING 85 CC OF CLOUDY YELLOW FLUID. BILATERAL IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED. SHE IS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING A WAIT-AND-SEE STRATEGY AND IS ALIVE WITHOUT DISEASE 8 MONTHS AFTER HER LYMPHOMA DIAGNOSIS. TITLE: ""THE CASE AGAINST BIOFILM AS THE PRIMARY INITIATOR OF BREAST IMPLANT-ASSOCIATED ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA."" THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO PRESENT THE FIRST PUBLISHED REPORT OF A BILATERAL ALK-NEGATIVE ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA DIAGNOSED BY CYTOLOGY.

ANALYSIS OF THE MICROBIOME IN BREAST IMPLANTÂ¿ASSOCIATED ALCL SPECIMENS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WITH SPECIES IDENTIFIED IN NONTUMOR CAPSULE SPECIMENS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER PROPORTION OF RALSTONIA SPP. PRESENT IN ALCL SPECIMENS COMPARED WITH NONTUMOR CAPSULE SPECIMENS (P < 0.05). IN CONTRAST, SIGNIFICANTLY MORE STAPHYLOCOCCUS SPP. WERE FOUND ASSOCIATED WITH NONTUMOR CAPSULE SPECIMENS COMPARED WITH BREAST IMPLANTÂ¿ASSOCIATED ALCL SPECIMENS (P < 0.001). BACTERIAL BIOFILM WAS VISUALIZED BOTH ON SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY AND FLUORESCENT IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION.Â¿ CYTOLOGICAL MARKERS ALK- AND CD30+ HAVE BEEN REPORTED. ACCORDING TO TABLE 1 Â¿CLINICAL SUMMARY OF BREAST IMPLANTÂ¿ASSOCIATED ALCL PATIENTS,Â¿ THERE WAS 1 CASE OF ALCL WHICH PRESENTED WITH BOTH EFFUSION AND TUMOR. THERE IS CURRENTLY NO WAY TO DETERMINE WHICH CASES HAD WHICH DEVICE TYPE OR TESTED NEGATIVE FOR BACTERIAL INFECTION.
