DEVICE LABELING: ACTIVE INFECTION ANYWHERE IN THE BODY MAY INCREASE RISK OF PERIPROSTHETIC INFECTION. DO NOT EXPOSE THE TISSUE EXPANDER OR INJECTION NEEDLES TO CONTAMINANTS, WHICH INCREASE THE RISK OF INFECTION. PATIENTS WHO PRESENT WOUND DEHISCENCE, TISSUE EROSION, ISCHEMIA OR NECROSIS RUN AN INCREASED RISK OF PERIPROSTHETIC INFECTION. MEASURES TO PROTECT SUCH AREAS FROM INFECTION SHOULD BE TAKEN. SIGNS OF ACUTE INFECTION REPORTED IN ASSOCIATION WITH TISSUE EXPANDERS INCLUDE, TENDERNESS, FLUID ACCUMULATION, PAIN AND FEVER. INFECTION MAY COMPROMISE THE EXPANSION PROCESS. POSTOPERATIVE INFECTIONS SHOULD BE TREATED AGGRESSIVELY ACCORDING TO STANDARD MEDICAL PRACTICES TO AVOID MORE SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS. INFECTION THAT IS UNRESPONSIVE TO TREATMENT OR NECROTIZING INFECTION MAY REQUIRE PREMATURE TISSUE EXPANDER REMOVAL. INFECTION IS AN INHERENT RISK FOLLOWING ANY TYPE OF INVASIVE SURGERY, AND MAY OCCUR DURING THE TISSUE EXPANSION PROCESS. PATIENTS WHO PRESENT WITH WOUND DEHISCENCE, TISSUE EROSION, ISCHEMIA OR NECROSIS, AND PATIENTS UNDERGOING IMMEDIATE BREAST RECONSTRUCTION RUN AN INCREASED RISK OF PERIPROSTHETIC INFECTION.

POSTOPERATIVE INFECTIONS SHOULD BE TREATED AGGRESSIVELY ACCORDING TO STANDARD MEDICAL PRACTICES TO AVOID MORE SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS. INFECTION THAT IS UNRESPONSIVE TO TREATMENT OR NECROTIZING INFECTION MAY REQUIRE PREMATURE BREAST TISSUE EXPANDER REMOVAL. IN RARE INSTANCES, ACUTE INFECTION MAY OCCUR IN A BREAST WITH IMPLANTS.

PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED TO CONTACT A PHYSICIAN IMMEDIATELY FOR DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT FOR ANY OF THESE SYMPTOMS. POSTOPERATIVE HEMATOMA AND SEROMA MAY CONTRIBUTE TO INFECTION. POSTOPERATIVE HEMATOMA AND SEROMA MAY BE MINIMIZED BY METICULOUS ATTENTION TO HEMOSTASIS DURING SURGERY, AND POSSIBLY BY POSTOPERATIVE USE OF CLOSED DRAINS.

TO CONTINUE TO PERFORM A MONTHLY BREAST SELF EXAMINATION EFFICIENTLY, YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU IDENTIFY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLANT AND YOUR BREAST TISSUE.

ALSO, SHE HAD AN ERYTHEMATOUS RASH ON HER ARM EXTENDING THROUGH THE CHEST AND RIGHT BREAST. THE SKIN WAS INDURATED WITH A FIRM LUMP IN THE RIGHT EXTERNAL QUADRANT OF THE RIGHT BREAST. SHE HAD PAIN ON HER ARM, BUT SHE DIDN'T HAVE FEVER. WE ORDERED AN MRI OF THE ARM INVOLVING THE BREAST, IT SHOWED A FASCIAL HYPERINTENSITY AND SWELLING OF THE SOFT TISSUE. ADDITIONALLY, WE PERFORMED ROUTINE LABORATORIES THAT SHOWED HYPERLEUKOCYTOSIS OF 38,000 WITH SEVERE EOSINOPHILIA OF 26,000, THE HAEMOGLOBIN AND PLATELETS WERE NORMAL. THE HS-CRP WAS 2.92 AND THE PROCALCITONIN WAS NEGATIVE. THE LDH WAS 393 AND THE BETA-2 MICROGLOBULIN WAS 2000. THE KIDNEY AND LIVER FUNCTION TEST WERE UNREMARKABLE. WE PERFORMED A PET SCAN THAT SHOWED HYPERMETABOLISM OF THE PREVIOUS DESCRIBED SWOLLEN AREA AND ENLARGEMENT AND HYPERMETABOLISM OF PERIHEPATIC LYMPH NODES. THEREFORE, A BIOPSY OF THE ARM WAS PERFORMED, THE PATHOLOGIC SPECIMEN INCLUDED SKIN, SOFT TISSUE, FASCIA AND MUSCLE. THE PATHOLOGY RESULT WAS CONSISTENT WITH ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (CD4+, CD30+, EMA+,. ALT-), SO A SURGICAL REMOVAL OF BOTH BREAST IMPLANTS WAS CARRIED OUT. THE PATHOLOGY LAB CONFIRMED THAT AROUND THE IMPLANT'S CAPSULE OF THE RIGHT BREAST WAS AN EXTENDED INFILTRATION OF NEOPLASTIC CELLS CONSISTENT WITH ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA WITH THE SAME IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY PROFILE. INTERESTINGLY, THE NEOPLASTIC CELLS WERE SURROUNDED BY AN EOSINOPHIL-RICH INFLAMMATORY INFILTRATE. THE LEFT IMPLANT DIDN'T HAVE NEOPLASTIC CELLS. THE IMPLANTS WERE ALLERGAN MODEL MHP WITH A VOLUME OF 130 CUBIC CENTIMETERS; THEY WERE ROUND AND FILLED BY COHESIVE SILICONE. CURRENTLY, THE PT IS UNDER SYSTEMIC CHEMOTHERAPY WITH CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE, DOXORUBICIN, ETOPOSIDE, VINCRISTINE AND PREDNISONE.|ALLERGAN SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT||02/11/2016||||*|*||0HP|FTR|1.0||ALLERGAN SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT||||||US|ALLERGAN|||||MHP||True

IN RARE INSTANCES, ACUTE INFECTION MAY OCCUR IN A BREAST WITH IMPLANTS. THE SIGNS OF ACUTE INFECTION INCLUDE ERYTHEMA, TENDERNESS, FLUID ACCUMULATION, PAIN, AND FEVER. VERY RARELY, TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME, A POTENTIALLY LIFE-THREATENING CONDITION, HAS BEEN REPORTED IN WOMEN AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY. IT IS CHARACTERIZED BY SYMPTOMS THAT OCCUR SUDDENLY AND INCLUDE HIGH FEVER (102Â°F, 38.8Â°C OR HIGHER), VOMITING, DIARRHEA, A SUNBURN-LIKE RASH, RED EYES, DIZZINESS, LIGHTHEADEDNESS, MUSCLE ACHES, AND DROPS IN BLOOD PRESSURE, WHICH MAY CAUSE FAINTING. PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED TO CONTACT A PHYSICIAN IMMEDIATELY FOR DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT FOR ANY OF THESE SYMPTOMS. THERE HAVE BEEN CONCERNS RAISED REGARDING POTENTIAL DAMAGING EFFECTS ON CHILDREN BORN OF MOTHERS WITH IMPLANTS.
