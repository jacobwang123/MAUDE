NEVERTHELESS THE PRECIPITATED PARTICLES APPEAR SIMILAR TO AGGREGATES STUDIES IN OTHER RUPTURED DEVICES MICROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF THESE PARTICLES REVEALS THAT THEY ARE COTTON-LIKE PARACRYSTALLINE FORMATIONS THESE FORMATIONS WERE FOUND TO BE CHEMICAL RATHER THAN BIOLOGICAL IN ORIGIN THE LEFT SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT UNLIKE ITS COUNTERPART WAS RUPTURED AND SILICONE GEL WAS EXTERNALIZED THE SILICONE GEL WAS TRANSPARENT COLORLESS AND DID NOT CONTAIN ANY AGGREGATED PARTICLES THE PATHOLOGY SECTION OF THIS REPORT REVEALS THAT CELLULAR REACTIVE CHANGES OCCURRED RESULTING IN THE FORMATION OF A FIBROCONNECTIVE TISSUE CAPSULE THIS CAPSULE DISPLAYS SIGNS OF CHRONIC INFLAMMATION IT CONTAINS FOREIGN BODIES IN TISSUE CELLS AND FIBERS THE SEARCH REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF SILICONE PARTICLES INFILTRATING THE BREAST CAPSULE TISSUE THE PARTICLES WERE OBSERVED COATING THE WALLS OF THE EXTRACELLULAR SPACES BETWEEN THE TISSUE FIBERS AND CELL PARENCHYMA THE ENLARGED PRINTS ILLUSTRATE THE SILICONE PARTICLES IN A BRIGHT OFF-WHITE COLOR THAT STANDS OUT AGAINST THE TISSUE AND BACKGROUND WHICH ARE PURPLE AND BLUE RESPECTIVELY THE PRESENCE AND LOCATION OF THE SILICONE GEL PARTICLES IN THESE TISSUES INDICATE THAT THEY HAD MIGRATED FROM A RUPTURED ANDOR BLEEDING IMPLANT THE BREAST TISSUE REACTED TO THEIR PRESENCE BY FRAGMENTING THE EXTRUDED SILICONE GEL INTO MICROSCOPIC PARTICLES AND ENCAPSULATING THEM WITHIN FIBROUS TISSUE THESE PROCESSES OCCURRED OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME AND DID NOT RESULT FROM ANY SILICONE LEAKAGERUPTURE THAT MAY HAVE OCCURRED DURING SURGERY FOR THEIR REMOVAL GROSS DESCRIPTION LABELED AS RIGHT BREAST IMPLANT THIS SPECIMEN CAME IN A PLASTIC CONTAINER INTACT THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF BLEEDING OR RUPTURE THE SILICONE GEL IS COLORLESS BUT SOME PRECIPITATE
