CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMÂ¬MON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE.

OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: BILATERALLY SILICONE IMPLANT AND IMPLANT MATERIAL REMOVAL; BILATERAL FORMAL CAPSULECTOMIES (EXTENSIVE AND SEPARATE PROCEDURE); BILATERAL RETROMAMMARY BREAST RECONSTRUCTION WITH MCGHAN TEXTURED HIGH PROFILE ROUND GEL STYLE. PROCEDURE: THE PT WAS MARKED IN AN AWAKE SITTING POSITION. ALL THE RISKS, ALTERNATIVES AND IMPONDERABLES WERE DISCUSSED WITH THE PT PRIOR TO PROCEEDING AND PT'S SPOUSE. ABSOLUTELY NO GUARANTEES WHATSOEVER WERE MADE. THIS PT HAD A RUPTURED IMPLANT ON THE LEFT SIDE AND A VERY WORRISOME PRESENTATION ON THE RIGHT WITH A LOT OF BREAST ASYMMETRY AND QUESTIONED RUPTURE ON THE RIGHT SIDE.

THE POCKETS WERE ADJUSTED AND EXPANDED WHERE NECESSARY FOR SYMMETRY AND THEN PREPLACED INTRAMAMMARY SUTURES OF INTERRUPTED 3-0 VICRYL WERE ULTILIZED. A 15MM BLAKE DRAIN WAS LEFT IN PLACE ON EACH SIDE. BECAUSE OF THE BREAST ASYMMETRY WITH THE RIGHT BREAST ACTUALLY BEING LARGER THAN THE LEFT FROM BREAST TISSUE, NOT ONLY PREOPERATIVELY, BUT DR HAD TO REMOVE MORE ON THE LEFT SIDE. DR PUT A 340CC MCGHAN HIGH PROFILE TEXTURED ROUND IMPLANT ON THE LEFT SIDE AND A 300CC ON THE RIGHT SIDE. SUTURES WERE TIED DOWN AND TRANSECTED. BREASTS WERE CLOSED WITH INTERRUPTED BURIED 4-0 AND 5-0 VICRYL FOLLOWED BY STERI-STRIPS. THE PT WAS THEN PLACED IN A CUSTOM BRA AND DRESSING. BLOOD LOSS WAS LESS THAN 100CC. NO PRODUCTS WERE GIVEN.

EXAM WAS CONSISTENT WITH AN INFECTED BREAST IMPLANT, THEREFORE, THE IMPLANT WAS REMOVED IN THE OFFICE UNDER LOCAL ANESTHESIA. HER EPIDERMOLYSIS EVENTUALLY CLEARED AND THE INFECTION IMPROVED. HOWEVER, SHE DEVELOPED AN INFLAMMATORY ABSCESS IN THE INFRAMAMMARY PORTION OF THE RIGHT BREAST THAT REQUIRED OPERATIVE EXCISION AND DEBRIDEMENT UNDER ANESTHESIA. THE TISSUE THAT WAS REMOVED AND SENT TO THE LABORATORY CAME BACK ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA. THIS BREAST EVENTUALLY WENT ON TO HEAL. SHE WAS SEEN IN CONSULTATION AT (B)(6) AND RECEIVED CHEMOTHERAPY. BECAUSE OF THE POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION OF THE CANCER WITH THE IMPLANT, ALONG WITH HER ASYMMETRY ISSUES, SHE REQUESTED REMOVAL OF THE LEFT IMPLANT, WHICH WAS DONE UNEVENTFULLY.

I WAS TOLD BY THE PLASTIC SURGEON IT WAS A ONE TIME PROCEDURE AND I WOULD GO TO MY GRAVE WITH ""NICE LOOKING"" BREASTS. SINCE THEN THERE HAS BEEN AN EXPLOSION OF MEDICAL FACTS AND STUDIES REVEALING THE ISSUES CONNECTED TO THESE IMPLANTS. OVER THE YEARS, I EXPRESSED NUMEROUS CONCERNS AND COMPLAINTS TO MY DOCTORS ONLY TO BE TOLD NOT TO WORRY UNLESS THEY WERE GIVING ME PROBLEMS EVEN THOUGH I WAS HAVING VARIOUS HEALTH ISSUES. NO ONE IN MY AREA WANTS TO GIVE VALIDATION TO THE FACT THERE CAN BE HEALTH PROBLEMS CONNECTED TO THESE BREAST IMPLANTS. ASIDE FROM THYROID AND RHEUMATOLOGICAL DISEASES, I STARTED HAVING VARIOUS CHEST PAINS, SHORTNESS OF BREATH AND WHAT THEY CALLED CALCIFICATIONS IN MY BREAST. I WAS SENT TO A CARDIOLOGIST AND MY GYNECOLOGIST SENT ME FOR ULTRASOUNDS. HAD THEY DONE MORE INTENSE STUDIES OF MY IMPLANTS THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND BLEEDING AND RUPTURE. ON (B)(6) 2012, I HAD AN EXPLANTATION DONE FOR MY OWN PEACE OF MIND. THE PLASTIC SURGEON SAID HE HAD NO IDEA WHAT HE WAS GETTING INTO UNTIL HE OPENED ME UP FOR THE REMOVAL. HE SAID IT WAS THE WORST CASE HE HAD SEEN IN HIS 27 YEARS OF PRACTICE. THE RIGHT SIDE HAD A SIGNIFICANT GEL BLEED AND THE LEFT SIDE WAS RUPTURED WITH THE SILICONE RESEMBLING PLUMBERS CAULKING. HE SAID HE DID SCRAPING, DIGGING, AND CUTTING AWAY AT TISSUE TO REMOVE ALL HE COULD, BUT WAS UNABLE TO GET IT ALL. THERE WAS STILL SOME LEFT EMBEDDED BETWEEN MY RIBS AND IN CREVICES HE COULDN'T GET TO. NEEDLESS TO SAY, THERE WASN'T MUCH OF MY OWN BREAST LEFT AT THE COMPLETION. HE WANTED TO PUT IN SALINE IMPLANTS AND I SAID ""NO, I'VE BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH AND I DON'T THINK THE SALINE ARE SAFE EITHER."" HE SAID IT WOULD BE UP TO MY LIVER AND KIDNEYS TO TRY AND DISPOSE OF THE REMAINING SILICONE. I AM TAKING IT DAY BY DAY AND PRAY THAT ONE DAY THIS WILL BE JUST A BAD MEMORY.

4672656|13207851|N|1||(B)(4). THE EVENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA WAS INITIALLY REPORTED VIA EASR ON (B)(6), 2010, WITH THE ADVERSE EVENT TERM CODE OF CANCER. AN UPDATE TO OUR SAFETY DATABASE FOR THIS REPORTED EVENT NOTES THAT THE TERM CODE HAS BEEN CHANGED FROM CANCER TO LYMPHOMA-ALCL DUE TO INCREASED SPECIFICITY. SEROMA WAS REPORTED AT THAT TIME ALSO. DEVICE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. CALCIUM DEPOSITS CAN FORM IN THE TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT WITH SYMPTOMS THAT MAY INCLUDE PAIN AND FIRMNESS. LYMPHADENOPATHY HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED IN SOME WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS. BASED ON INFO REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGAN'S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERS' BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MUFTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. USE CARE IN SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURES SUCH AS OPEN CAPSULOTOMY, BREAST POCKET REVISION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA ASPIRATION, AND BIOPSY/LUMPECTOMY TO AVOID DAMAGE TO THE IMPLANT SHELL OR VALVE. ANY POSTOPERATIVE EVACUATION OF HEMATOMA OR SEROMA MUST BE CONDUCTED WITH CARE TO AVOID BREAST IMPLANT CONTAMINATION, OR DAMAGE FROM SHARP INSTRUMENTS. THE USE OF MICROWAVE DIATHERMY IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST IMPLANTS IS NOT RECOMMENDED, AS IT HAS BEEN REPORTED TO CAUSE TISSUE NECROSIS, SKIN EROSION, AND EXTRUSION OF THE IMPLANT. ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE IN VIVO EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. PATIENTS SHOULD BE INFORMED THAT DISSATISFACTION WITH COSMETIC RESULTS RELATED TO SUCH THINGS AS SCAR DEFORMITY, HYPERTROPHIC SCARRING, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, INCORRECT SIZE, AND IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY MAY OCCUR. CAREFUL SURGICAL PLANNING AND TECHNIQUE CAN MINIMIZE, BUT NOT PRECLUDE, THE RISK OF SUCH RESULTS. PRE-EXISTING ASYMMETRY MAY NOT BE ENTIRELY CORRECTABLE. REVISION SURGERY MAY BE INDICATED TO MAINTAIN PATIENT SATISFACTION BUT CARRIES ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS AND RISKS.

5369613|36250016|D|1||CIRCA 1996, I UNDERWENT A BI-LATERAL MASTECTOMY FOR CANCER WITH IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION. AFTER EXPANDERS WERE USED, MENTOR SILTEX IMPLANTS (SILICONE GEL) WERE INSERTED. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A PHYSICALLY ACTIVE PERSON. I WAS A CLASSICAL BALLET DANCER ON A PROFESSIONAL TRACK. SINCE THE AGE OF 11, I DANCED IN A COMPANY, AND LATER, MOVED INTO TEACHING BALLET FOR A COMPETITIVE GYMNASTICS TEAM. OVER THE YEARS SINCE RECEIVING IMPLANTS MY HEALTH HAS STEADILY DECLINED AND ALL SYMPTOMS HAVE CONSISTENTLY WORSENED. THEY HAVE COME TO A HEAD DURING THE LAST 2 TO 3 YEARS. THE WORST PART OF THAT DECLINE IS SEVERE, DEBILITATING FATIGUE WITH SEVERE PAIN AND INJURY WITH ANY EXERTION AND HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, DEBILITATING MIGRAINES. BUT THOSE ARE CERTAINLY NOT MY ONLY SYMPTOMS. I HAVE BROUGHT MY ISSUES TO MY PCPS OVER THE LAST YEARS. THEY TESTED ME FOR A FEW POSSIBLE COMMON CAUSES, BUT COULDN'T FIND A REASON. EVENTUALLY, THEY JUST IGNORED THESE SYMPTOMS. I RECENTLY CHANGED PCPS AND MY NEW ONE BEGAN A DILIGENT PROCESS OF ELIMINATION. SHE HAS BEEN SENDING ME TO SPECIALISTS AND WE'VE BEEN DOING ONE TEST AFTER ANOTHER TO RULE THINGS OUT. THEY'VE ALL COME OUT NORMAL. UNTIL WE DID A BREAST ULTRASOUND. IT SHOWED SIGNS OF IMPLANT RUPTURE. I WAS SENT TO DO AN MRI, AND IT CONFIRMED IMPLANT RUPTURE. DUE TO MY MASTECTOMIES, I HAVE NO SENSATION IN MY BREAST OR ARMPIT AREAS, SO WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG AGO THE RUPTURE TOOK PLACE. BECAUSE SILENT RUPTURES ARE COMMON, THE RUPTURE COULD HAVE HAPPENED YEARS AGO. THE CHANGE IN SHAPE AND SIZE AND THEIR ASYMMETRY HAS BEEN NOTICEABLE FOR SOME YEARS, BUT MY PREVIOUS PCP HAD NO COMMENT ABOUT THAT. I AM EXTREMELY UPSET THAT I WAS NOT SENT FOR A BREAST ULTRASOUND OR OTHER RELATED TEST BY MY PREVIOUS PCP. ALL THE LITERATURE SAYS THAT PEOPLE WITH BREAST IMPLANTS SHOULD BE FOLLOWED ON A REGULAR BASIS. I AM EXTREMELY THANKFUL THAT I HAVE FOUND A DILIGENT PCP AND AN NOW IN GOOD CARE. I KNOW THAT A CONNECTION BETWEEN IMPLANTS AND RUPTURED IMPLANTS AND HEALTH ISSUES ISN'T SOMETHING THE MAJORITY OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION WANTS TO ADMIT, BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE CONNECTION IS REAL. SINCE DISCOVERING THAT MY IMPLANTS ARE RUPTURED, I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONNECT WITH OVER (B)(6) WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS OR RUPTURED IMPLANTS WHO ARE HAVING THE SAME SYMPTOMS I HAVE, AND MORE. MANY OF THEM ARE IN WORSE CONDITION THAN I AM. ALL OF US HAVE LOST QUALITY OF LIFE. A HUGE PERCENTAGE OF THEM REPORT THAT THEIR HEALTH ISSUES SUBSIDE AFTER HAVING THEIR IMPLANTS REMOVED. AND THESE ARE ONLY THE WOMEN WITH WHOM I HAVE CONNECTED. THERE MUST BE SO MANY MORE OUT THERE. THE WORST PART OF ALL THIS IS THAT OUR CONDITIONS ARE BEING IGNORED OR POO-POOED BY THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY SO THERE IS OFTEN NO HELP FOR US UNLESS AND UNTIL WE CAN FIND A DOCTOR WHO TAKES OUT HEALTH SERIOUSLY. I AM CURRENTLY WAITING FOR A DATE TO HAVE MY IMPLANTS REMOVED. I WILL NOT HAVE THEM REPLACED.
