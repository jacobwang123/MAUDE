512539|366537|D|1||PT IS NOT AND HAS NEVER BEEN A PART OF ANY LIGITATION CONCERNING ANY MATTERS REGARDING BREAST IMPLANTS. IN 2001 PT HAD SURGERY PERFORMED BY DR IN HIS CLINIC TO REMOVE BOTH RUPTURED SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. PT WAS TOLD THAT THE DR HAD TO REMOVE A CAPSULE AND SOME BREAST TISSUE DURING THE SURGERY, AND WAS TOLD THAT SINCE HE HAD TO REMOVE ALOT OF BREAST TISSUE DURING THE SURGERY THAT PT WOULD BE BETTER OFF USING SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE RUPTURED IMPLANTS. HE ADVISED THEM THAT PT WOULD NOT BE HAPPY WITH THE SALINE IMPLANTS. THE DR TOLD THEM THAT PT WOULD HAVE TO SIGN A RELEASE WHICH PT DID NOT READ THOROUGHLY AND SIGNED ON THE DAY OF SURGERY. THE DR DID NOT ADVISE THEM THAT THE SILICONE IMPLANT THAT HE WAS USING ON THEM WAS ACTUALLY A NEW PRODUCT THAT WAS BEING TESTED ON THE MARKET. PT FOUND THIS OUT AFTER PT RESEARCHED THE SILICONE IMPLANT THAT HE USED ON THEM ON THE INTERNET. INAMED WAS THE SUPPLIER OF THEIR SILICONE IMPLANT AND APPARENTLY THEY ARE TRYING TO GET FDA APPROVAL FOR THE RELEASE OF THIS SILICONE IMPLANT ONTO THE USA MARKETPLACE. PT IS IN NEED OF SURGERY TO REMOVE THE IMPLANTS DUE TO A RUPTURE IN RIGHT IMPLANT. PT HAS A VERY LARGE LUMP ON THE SIDE OF THEIR RIGHT BREAST, AND PT FEARS THAT PT MAY LOOSE ENTIRE RIGHT BREAST SINCE PT DOES NOT HAVE ALOT OF BREAST TISSUE REMAINING. PT WAS NOT ADVISED BY THE DR OF THE RISKS OF TESTING THIS NEW IMPLANT ON THEM NOR DID HE ADVISE THEM THAT THIS IMPLANT WAS ACTUALLY A NEW TESTING PRODUCT. PT FEELS THIS INAMED IMPLANT MUST NEVER BE RELEASED INTO THE MARKET. IT IS DANGEROUS AND RUPTURES EASILY. PT CALLED INAMED TO ADVISE THEM THAT THEY HAD NOTIFIED THEM VIA THEIR INTERNET WEB SITE ABOUT THE RUPTURE VIA THE MANNER THAT THEY REQUEST ON THE WEB SITE. AND DID NOT HEAR BACK FROM THE CO TO DATE. YESTERDAY PT CALLED INAMED IN CALIFORNIA AND SPOKE WITH THEIR PRODUCT SUPPORT DEPARTMENT - THIS AFTER PT'S DR COULD NOT ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THE IMPLANT FOR PT, AND AFTER SEVERAL DAYS OF THE DR AVOIDING THEIR TELEPHONE CALLS. PT ASKED THEIR DR IF HE HAD REPORTED RUPTURE TO THE FDA AND HE SAID NO, A QUARTERLY BASIS. PT ASKED INAMED IF THEY WOULD PLEASE VIDEO TAPE THE REMOVAL OF THE RUPTURED IMPLANT FOR MEDICAL LEARNING, AND FOR THE PUBLIC TO BECOME MORE AWARE OF THE PROBLEMS INHERENT WITH THESE IMPLANTS. THEY REFUSED TO CONSIDER PT'S OFFER TO VIDEO TAPE THE REMOVAL, AND STATED TO PT THAT NO DR THAT THEY SUPPLY IMPLANTS TO WOULD APPROVE VIDEO TAPING OF A REMOVAL. FURTHER THEY COULD NOT SUPPLY TO PT ANY DATA ON THE SAFETY OF THE IMPLANT THAT WAS IMPLANTED IN PT. THE DR THAT IMPLANTED THE SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS IN PT IN 2001 IS NOT COOPERATING WITH QUESTIONS. AND THEY ADVISED PT THAT IT WOULD BE TO PTS ADVANTAGE TO USE THE SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS AGAIN. HE TOLD PT THAT PT WAS HIS FIRST RUPTURE, AND THAT PT'S RUPTURE WAS HIGHLY UNUSUAL. THIS PT HAS LEARNED IS NOT THE CASE, INDEED THERE HAVE BEEN MANY RUPTURES. PT BELIEVES THAT THEIR DR MAY ALSO BE A SHAREHOLDER OF INAMED STOCK AND THEREFORE PUSHED PT INTO THIS IMPLANT USAGE WITHOUT INFORMING PT OF ITS RISKS PROPERLY, IN ORDER TO GAIN SOMETHING IN RETURN FOR ASSISTING INAMED IN FINDING PARTICIPANTS FOR ITS SILICONE GEL IMPLANT STUDY. PT IS OUTRAGED THAT PT HAS BEEN USED IN THIS MANNER BY A DR WHO PT TRUSTED TO ADVISE THEM AS TO WHAT WOULD BE MOST APPROPRIATE FOR THEM AND SAFE. PT MUST UNDERGO SURGERY TO REMOVE THE IMPLANTS IMMEDIATELY. PT ASKS IF FDA WOULD BE INTERESTED IN VIDEO TAPING THE REMOVAL FOR EDUCATIONAL AND MEDICAL PURPOSES. PT WOULD ALSO LIKE TO TESTIFY IN ANY HEARING THAT FDA MAY HAVE REGARDING SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. PT ALSO LEARNED THAT PLASTIC SURGEONS DO NOT KEEP EACH OTHER INFORMED OF RUPTURE RATES, POSSIBLE CAUSES OF RUPTURES, OR ANY OTHER PROBLEMS RELATING TO BREAST IMPLANTS. AN INTERNET SITE MUST BE SET-UP FOR DRS TO TRACK, REPORT, AND STAY UPDATED REGARDING BREAST IMPLANT COMPLICATIONS. THIS SHOULD BE FEDERALLY MANDATED. THE PUBLIC SHOULD ALSO BE ALLOWED ACCESS TO THIS INFO, THUS ALLOWING CONSUMERS TO HAVE THE NECESSARY AND RELEVANT DATA REGARDING EACH AND EVERY IMPLANT DEVICE ON THE MARKET AND ITS PERFORMANCE RECORDS. EACH AND EVERY IMPLANT DEVICE THAT IS RELEASED INTO THE MARKETPLACE MUST BE TRACKED AND DOCUMENTED UNTIL ITS REMOVAL. THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO EFFECTIVELY TRACK BREAST IMPLANTATION AND ITS EFFECTS. THE FDA MUST ENACT STRICT GUIDELINES ON THE MEDICAL PROFESSION REGARDING BREAST IMPLANTATION, WITH THIS TRACKING METHOD -- IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT. INAMED MUST BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR EACH AND EVERY IMPLANT DEVICE THAT LEAVES THEIR PRODUCTION FACILITIES. PT IS VERY UPSET THAT THE FDA IS NOT MONITORING INAMED AND THE PLASTIC SURGEONS MORE CLOSELY. PT BELIEVES THAT THERE IS ALOT OF CORRUPTION, GOING ON AT INAMED AND ITS PARTNERING WITH DRS THAT IS COMPROMISING WOMEN'S HEALTH. PT WILL BE CONTACTING THE OPRAH WINFREY SHOW IF PT DOES NOT HEAR FROM THE FDA, AND REPORTING THESE PROBLEMS TO HER AND A NATIONWIDE AUDIENCE. PT WILL ALSO LOOK INTO REMOVING THEIR RUPTURED SILICONE IMPLANTS ON NATIONAL TELEVISION TO ALLOW WOMEN TO SEE FIRST HAND THE DEVASTATING AND DANGEROUS EFFECTS OF SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS ON WOMEN'S HEALTH, AND THE RECKLESS, HAPHAZARD MANNER IN WHICH INAMED AND PLASTIC SURGEONS ARE CONDUCTING THEIR OPERATIONS. IT WILL SHOCK THE NATION, IN ADDITION PT IS ASTONISHED THAT THE FDA ALLOWS BREAST IMPLANTS OF ANY KIND TO CONTINUE TO BE IMPLANTED PT WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY. THE FDA MUST ISSUE AN IMMEDIATE ORDER REQUIRING ANY WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS IN THE USA TO REMOVE THEM IMMEDIATELY DUE TO HEALTH RISKS AND THE VERY LIKELIHOOD OF RUPTURES AND COMPLICATONS.|INAMED - MCGHAN MEDICAL CORPORATION|*|02/07/2004|*|||Y||501548.0|*|FTR|1.0||STYLE 120 300CC GEL-FILLED MAMMARY IMPLANT|Y|*|*||*|US|INAMED CORP||CA|*||*|*|True

SHE WAS TAKING ASPIRIN 81MG AT THE MOMENT OF THE EVENT. SHE WAS ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL IN (B)(6) 2016 BECAUSE A 5 MONTH HISTORY OF PROGRESSIVE SWELLING OF THE RIGHT ARM. ALSO, SHE HAD AN ERYTHEMATOUS RASH ON HER ARM EXTENDING THROUGH THE CHEST AND RIGHT BREAST. THE SKIN WAS INDURATED WITH A FIRM LUMP IN THE RIGHT EXTERNAL QUADRANT OF THE RIGHT BREAST. SHE HAD PAIN ON HER ARM, BUT SHE DIDN'T HAVE FEVER. WE ORDERED AN MRI OF THE ARM INVOLVING THE BREAST, IT SHOWED A FASCIAL HYPERINTENSITY AND SWELLING OF THE SOFT TISSUE. ADDITIONALLY, WE PERFORMED ROUTINE LABORATORIES THAT SHOWED HYPERLEUKOCYTOSIS OF 38,000 WITH SEVERE EOSINOPHILIA OF 26,000, THE HAEMOGLOBIN AND PLATELETS WERE NORMAL. THE HS-CRP WAS 2.92 AND THE PROCALCITONIN WAS NEGATIVE. THE LDH WAS 393 AND THE BETA-2 MICROGLOBULIN WAS 2000. THE KIDNEY AND LIVER FUNCTION TEST WERE UNREMARKABLE. WE PERFORMED A PET SCAN THAT SHOWED HYPERMETABOLISM OF THE PREVIOUS DESCRIBED SWOLLEN AREA AND ENLARGEMENT AND HYPERMETABOLISM OF PERIHEPATIC LYMPH NODES. THEREFORE, A BIOPSY OF THE ARM WAS PERFORMED, THE PATHOLOGIC SPECIMEN INCLUDED SKIN, SOFT TISSUE, FASCIA AND MUSCLE. THE PATHOLOGY RESULT WAS CONSISTENT WITH ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (CD4+, CD30+, EMA+,. ALT-), SO A SURGICAL REMOVAL OF BOTH BREAST IMPLANTS WAS CARRIED OUT. THE PATHOLOGY LAB CONFIRMED THAT AROUND THE IMPLANT'S CAPSULE OF THE RIGHT BREAST WAS AN EXTENDED INFILTRATION OF NEOPLASTIC CELLS CONSISTENT WITH ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA WITH THE SAME IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY PROFILE. INTERESTINGLY, THE NEOPLASTIC CELLS WERE SURROUNDED BY AN EOSINOPHIL-RICH INFLAMMATORY INFILTRATE. THE LEFT IMPLANT DIDN'T HAVE NEOPLASTIC CELLS. THE IMPLANTS WERE ALLERGAN MODEL MHP WITH A VOLUME OF 130 CUBIC CENTIMETERS; THEY WERE ROUND AND FILLED BY COHESIVE SILICONE.
