6732140|80678267|N|1||FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTER REGARDING RETURN OF THE DEVICE HAS BEEN REQUESTED. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. DEVICE LABELING: SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANTS ARE PRONE TO UNINTENDED INSTRUMENT TRAUMA DURING IMPLANTATION OR DURING EXPLANTATION. NUMBER 1, 2 SHELL FAILURE CAN RESULT FROM DAMAGE BY SCALPELS, SUTURE NEEDLES, HYPODERMIC NEEDLES, HEMOSTATS, AND ADSON FORCEPS AND HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN EXPLANTED DEVICE SHELLS USING SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY. ALLERGANÂ¿S (RETRIEVAL STUDY) ANALYSES OF EXPLANTED DEVICES HAVE IDENTIFIED UNINTENDED SURGICAL INSTRUMENT DAMAGE AS ONE POTENTIAL CAUSE OF SHELL FAILURE AND THUS IMPLANT RUPTURE. THE PATIENT SHOULD BE TOLD THAT THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGE IN THE IMPLANT SHAPE MAY BE SIGNS OF SYMPTOMATIC RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. IF THE PATIENT HAS ANY OF THESE SIGNS, SHE SHOULD BE TOLD TO REPORT THEM AND POSSIBLY HAVE AN MRI EVALUATION TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. BREAST IMPLANTS RUPTURE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. RUPTURES CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO RUPTURE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, STRESSING THE IMPLANT DURING IMPLANTATION AND WEAKENING IT, FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL, EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED), TRAUMA, COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING, AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF RUPTURE FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT. IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF RUPTURE. LABORATORY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RUPTURE ARE ONGOING. SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SEE TABLE 3 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING MRI SCREENING. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE. IF RUPTURE OCCURS, SILICONE GEL MAY EITHER REMAIN WITHIN THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), MOVE OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE (EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), OR MOVE OUTSIDE THE BREAST (GEL MIGRATION). THERE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY THAT RUPTURE MAY PROGRESS FROM INTRACAPSULAR TO EXTRACAPSULAR AND BEYOND. IN ALLERGANÂ¿S CORE STUDY, THERE WAS A MRI SCREENING COHORT WHO HAD REGULAR MRIS TO SCREEN FOR BREAST IMPLANT RUPTURE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE SYMPTOMATIC (I.E., MRI COHORT) AND A NON-MRI SCREENING COHORT WHO WERE NOT SCREENED WITH BREAST IMPLANT MRIS (I.E., NON-MRI COHORT). THE RUPTURE RATES IN THE MRI COHORTS WERE 9.3% FOR PRIMARY AUGMENTATION, 5.4% FOR REVISION-AUGMENTATION, 35.4% FOR PRIMARY RECONSTRUCTION, AND 0% FOR REVISION-RECONSTRUCTION. THE RUPTURE RATE FOR THE WHOLE MRI COHORT IN THE CORE STUDY (INCLUDING AUGMENTATION, REVISION-AUGMENTATION, RECONSTRUCTION, AND REVISION-RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS) THROUGH 10 YEARS WAS 13.0% FOR PATIENTS AND 7.7% FOR IMPLANTS. ACROSS ALL PATIENTS IN THE CORE STUDY, ALL RUPTURES WERE INTRACAPSULAR WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 3 CASES OF EXTRACAPSULAR GEL (ONE RUPTURE PROGRESSED TO EXTRACAPSULAR GEL FOLLOWING EXPLORATORY SURGERY TO CONFIRM THE RUPTURE AND THEN IMPLANT REPLACEMENT WAS DELAYED).|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|07/21/2017||||N|R||0HP|FWM|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||NI|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True
6559362|74887820|N|1||(B)(4). THE REPORTED EVENTS ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THESE EVENTS. DEVICE HISTORY RECORD REVIEW: REVIEW OF DHR FOR WORK ORDER 2183997 DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY DEVIATIONS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS OR NON-CONFORMANCES DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. ALL GEL BREAST IMPLANTS WERE REVIEWED AS PART OF THE ASSEMBLY OPERATIONS AND THESE TASKS WERE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO APPLICABLE CURRENT PROCEDURES TO ENSURE THAT ASSEMBLY MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. THE DHR ASSEMBLY REPORT FROM SAP WAS VERIFIED AND THERE WAS NO SCRAP RELATED WITH REPORTED EVENT, ALL DEVICES WERE CONFORMANCE DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION GATHERED DURING THE DHR REVIEW, THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT DEVICES FROM WORK ORDER 2183997 WERE ASSEMBLED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALLERGAN MEDICAL PROCEDURES AND SPECIFICATIONS. THE REPORTED DEVICE WAS INTACT AT THE TIME OF PRODUCTION AND MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. REPORTED EVENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN THE LABELING: PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENT. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. YOU SHOULD PERFORM SELF-EXAMINATION OF YOUR BREASTS EVERY MONTH FOR CANCER SCREENING. HOWEVER, THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU DISTINGUISH THE IMPLANT FROM YOUR BREAST TISSUE. THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGES IN IMPLANT SHAPE, MAY BE SIGNS OF A RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. THESE SIGNS SHOULD BE REPORTED TO YOUR SURGEON AND POSSIBLY EVALUATED WITH AN MRI. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.|INSPIRA TEXTURED SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|N-TRM445|05/10/2017||||N|R||0HP|FTR|1.0|10/11/2016|PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||2183997|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

THE EVENTS OF DEATH, LYMPHOMA-ALCL, LYMPHOMA, SEROMA, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, AND BREAST LUMPS ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THESE EVENTS. SALINE DEVICE LABELING: RADIATION TO THE BREAST Â¿ ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE IN VIVO EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, ASYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER THESE ADDITIONAL SURGERIES. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF DEFLATION. ADDITIONAL COMPLICATIONS Â¿ AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. CALCIUM DEPOSITS CAN FORM IN THE TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT WITH SYMPTOMS THAT MAY INCLUDE PAIN AND FIRMNESS. LYMPHADENOPATHY HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED IN SOME WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS. IN THE PASS STUDY, AT LEAST 1 REOPERATION WAS PERFORMED ON 315 PATIENTS (36.5%) THROUGH 10 YEARS. A TOTAL OF 424 REOPERATIONS WERE PERFORMED. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR REOPERATION THROUGH 10 YEARS ON AUGMENTATION PATIENTS WAS IMPLANT DEFLATION AT 21.7%. THE PERCENTAGE OF REOPERATIONS DUE TO LUMP/MASS/CYST INCREASED FROM 8.5% OF 293 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 5 YEARS TO 13.9% OF 424 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 10 YEARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF LUMPS, MASSES, AND CYSTS CAN BE EXPECTED TO NATURALLY INCREASE AS PATIENTS AGE AND COULD BE AN EXPLANATION FOR THE INCREASE. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. FOR MORE COMPLETE AND UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ON FDAÂ¿S ANALYSIS AND REVIEW OF THE ALCL IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST IMPLANTS PLEASE VISIT: HTTP://WWW.FDA.GOV/MEDICALDEVICES/PRODUCTSANDMEDICALPROCEDURES/IMPLANTSANDPROSTHETICS/BREASTIMPLANTS/UCM239995.HTM YOU ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO REPORT ANY PRODUCT PROBLEM OR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT TO ALLERGAN. DEATHS MUST BE REPORTED TO ALLERGAN AND FDA. SILICONE DEVICE LABELING: ONE OF THE KEY COMPLICATIONS REPORTED IS CALLED Â¿CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE.Â¿ CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS A TIGHTENING OF THE SCAR TISSUE (ALSO CALLED A CAPSULE) THAT NORMALLY FORMS AROUND THE BREAST IMPLANT DURING THE HEALING PROCESS AFTER SURGERY. IN SOME WOMEN, THE SCAR TISSUE (CAPSULE) SQUEEZES THE IMPLANT. THIS RESULTS IN FIRMNESS OR HARDENING OF THE BREAST, AND IT IS A RISK FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE. DEGREES OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE ARE CLASSIFIED BY THE BAKER GRADING SCALE.1 CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BAKER GRADES III AND IV ARE THE MOST SEVERE. BAKER GRADE III OFTEN RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SURGERY (REOPERATION) BECAUSE OF PAIN AND POSSIBLY ABNORMAL APPEARANCE. BAKER GRADE IV USUALLY RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR REOPERATION BECAUSE OF PAIN AND UNACCEPTABLE APPEARANCE. DO NOT TREAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BY CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY OR FORCEFUL EXTERNAL COMPRESSION, WHICH WILL LIKELY RESULT IN IMPLANT DAMAGE, RUPTURE, FOLDS, AND/OR HEMATOMA. ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. YOU SHOULD PERFORM SELF-EXAMINATION OF YOUR BREASTS EVERY MONTH FOR CANCER SCREENING. HOWEVER, THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU DISTINGUISH THE IMPLANT FROM YOUR BREAST TISSUE. THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGES IN IMPLANT SHAPE, MAY BE SIGNS OF A RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. THESE SIGNS SHOULD BE REPORTED TO YOUR SURGEON AND POSSIBLY EVALUATED WITH AN MRI. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA.

I TOLD THEM THAT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THEY HAD MY CURRENT CONTACT INFORMATION AND TO SEE IF THERE HAVE BEEN ANY UPDATES OR PROBLEMS WITH THEIR PRODUCT. HE LOOKED BUT COULDN'T FIND MY NAME AND SAID THAT THE PRODUCT MUST NOT HAVE BEEN REGISTERED. MY SURGERY WAS BACK IN 2008 (ALLERGAN/NATRELLE SILICONE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT). I CONTACTED THE CLINIC THAT DID THE PROCEDURE; THEY GAVE ME A COPY OF THE PAPER THAT WAS FAXED AND REGISTERED WITH ALLERGAN. WHEN I TOLD HER THAT THE ALLERGAN REP SAID THEY HADN'T RECEIVED THE REGISTRATION DOCUMENT, SHE LAUGHED AND SAID, ""SURE!"" I DON'T KNOW HOW OFTEN THIS HAPPENS BUT IT'S SCARY TO THINK THEY MAY BE ""LOSING"" THIS INFORMATION...HOW DO THEY CONTINUE TO FOLLOW UP WITH PATIENTS TO MAKE SURE THE PRODUCT ISN'T HAVING ADVERSE SIDE EFFECTS? PART OF THEIR AGREEMENT WAS TO FOLLOW PATIENTS AND PROVIDE YOU, THE FDA, WITH CURRENT INFORMATION AS TO HEALTH CONDITIONS OF PATIENTS. I AM WRITING THIS TO MAKE SURE SOMETHING IS DONE... I AM ONLY ONE OF MILLIONS THAT THIS AFFECTS! MY LIST OF SYMPTOMS IS GROWING AND MY HEALTH IS CONTINUING TO DETERIORATE. I HAVE A CONSULTATION SET UP FOR (B)(6) FOR A CONSULTATION TO BEGIN THE REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT. THIS WAS THE SOONEST I COULD GET IN. I HOPE THIS IS TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND SOMETHING IS DONE FOR WOMEN THAT SUFFER ENDLESSLY FROM THE TOXIC EFFECTS FROM IMPLANTS. SINCERELY, (B)(6).

REPORTS IN THE MEDICAL LITERATURE INDICATE THAT PATIENTS WITH BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT AT A GREATER RISK THAN THOSE WITHOUT BREAST IMPLANTS FOR DEVELOPING BREAST CANCER. REPORTS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT BREAST IMPLANTS MAY INTERFERE WITH OR DELAY BREAST CANCER DETECTION BY MAMMOGRAPHY AND/OR BIOPSY; HOWEVER, OTHER REPORTS IN THE PUBLISHED MEDICAL LITERATURE INDICATE THAT BREAST IMPLANTS NEITHER SIGNIFICANTLY DELAY BREAST CANCER DETECTION NOR ADVERSELY AFFECT CANCER SURVIVAL OF WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS. A LARGE FOLLOW-UP STUDY REPORTED NO EVIDENCE OF AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND CANCER, AND EVEN SHOWED A DECREASED INCIDENCE OF BREAST CANCER COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION. ONE STUDY HAS REPORTED AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF BRAIN CANCER IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS AS COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION. THE INCIDENCE OF BRAIN CANCER, HOWEVER, WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS WHEN COMPARED TO WOMEN WHO HAD OTHER PLASTIC SURGERIES A PUBLISHED REVIEW OF 4 LARGE STUDIES IN WOMEN WITH COSMETIC IMPLANTS AND AN ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP STUDY CONCLUDED THAT THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT SUPPORT AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BRAIN CANCER AND BREAST IMPLANTS. AN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL REVIEW ALSO LENT SUPPORT TO THE LACK OF CAUSATION BETWEEN IMPLANTS AND ANY TYPE OF CANCER. STUDIES HAVE REPORTED AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF RESPIRATORY/LUNG CANCER IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS. OTHER STUDIES OF WOMEN IN SWEDEN AND DENMARK HAVE FOUND THAT WOMEN WHO GET BREAST IMPLANTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE CURRENT SMOKERS THAN WOMEN WHO GET BREAST REDUCTION SURGERY OR OTHER TYPES OF COSMETIC SURGERY. SEVERAL LARGE STUDIES HAVE FOUND NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND RESPIRATORY/LUNG CANCER. TWO STUDIES REPORTED AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF CERVICAL/VULVAR CANCER IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS. ANOTHER LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP STUDY SHOWED EQUIVALENT INCIDENCES OF CERVICAL CANCER IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION. OTHER RECENT LARGE STUDIES CONCLUDED THAT THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT SUPPORT AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM CANCERS AND BREAST IMPLANTS. THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL STUDIES PUBLISHED THAT EXAMINED THE RISK OF OTHER TYPES OF CANCERS, E.G., THYROID CANCERS, URINARY SYSTEM CANCERS, SARCOMA, ENDOCRINE CANCER, CONNECTIVE TISSUE CANCER, CANCER OF THE EYE, AND UNSPECIFIED CANCERS IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS.

6574819|75418485|N|1||ARTICLE CITATION: Â¿BREAST IMPLANT ASSOCIATED ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (BIA-ALCL)Â¿THE UK EXPERIENCE AND FIRST REPORTED CASE OF NEOADJUVANT BRENTUXIMAB.Â¿ BY BY L JOHNSON, J O'DONOGHUE, H STARK, N COLLIS, A LENNARD, M BUTTERWORTH, N MCLEAN, M YOUSSEF, G GUI, I LYBURN, J BRISTOL, J HURREN, S SMITH, R JACKLIN, D CUNNINGHAM, AND F MACNEILL, PUBLISHED IN CANCER RESEARCH FEB/2017, ELECTRONICALLY PUBLISHED APR/2017. THE REPORTED EVENTS ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THESE EVENTS. REPORTED EVENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN THE LABELING: THE OCCURRENCE OF LUMPS, MASSES, AND CYSTS CAN BE EXPECTED TO NATURALLY INCREASE AS PATIENTS AGE AND COULD BE AN EXPLANATION FOR THE INCREASE. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|05/18/2017||||N|R||0HP|FWM|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||NI|||||UNKNOWN MANUFACTURER|||||||True

29265|17341|D|1||ON 2/26/79 RPTR'S DOCTOR PERFORMED A BILATERAL SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY AND IMMEDIATE INSERTION OF PROSTHESES. SHE HAD NO PAIN NOT EVEN FROM THE LUMPS. THE PAIN STARTED AFTER THE FIRST IMPLANTS. AFTER A FEW MONTHS THESE IMPLANTS STARTED GETTING VERY HARD, ROUND AND TIGHT LIKE A BASEBALL. IN EARLY 1982 THE DOCTOR REMOVED THE IMPLANTS AND SHE BELIEVES HE SAID HE WOULD PLACE THE IMPLANTS UNDER THE BREAST MUSCLES TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM. THE SECOND OPERATION DID NOT CORRECT HER PAIN PROBLEM. SHE QUESTIONED THIS PAIN IN RELATION TO HER IMPLANTS WITH SEVERAL DOCTORS BUT THEY HAD NO ANSWER FOR THE PROBLEM. IT STARTED GRADUALLY EVERY TWO TO THREE MONTHS WITH SUDDEN, SEVERE CRUSHING CHEST PAIN, WEAKNESS, FATIGUE HEADACHES, MEMORY, CONCENTRATION PROBLEMS AND NUMBNESS AND TINGLING IN THE EXTREMITIES. THE PAIN STARTS IN THE CHEST RADIATES UP TO THE NECK OVER THE LEFT SHOULDER DOWN THE LEFT SHOULDER, LEFT ARM AND SOMETIMES INTO THE LEFT LEG. SHE HAS THE PAIN CONSTANTLY NOW. ABOUT EVERY THREE TO FOUR DAYS SHE MUST HAVE A TORADOL SHOT TO EASE THE PAIN. ON 5/27/91 SHE SUDDENLY HAD RATHER SEVERE GRAND MAL TYPE SEIZURE ACTIVITY WHICH LASTED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES. SHE WAS EVALUATED AND THOUGHT TO HAVE HAD AN UNEXPLAINED GRAND MAL SEIZURE AND WAS IN A POSTICTAL STATE. ON 7/17/91 SHE WAS SEEN FOR A SEVERE NEUROLOGIC EVENT. SHE HAD BEEN HAVING SEVERE NECK, UPPER BACK, SHOULDER, AND UPPER EXTREMITY PAINS AT HOME AND WAS EXPERIENCING CONSIDERABLE PROBLEMS WITH THIS. SEVERAL TESTS WERE PERFORMED SUCH AS MRIS, CAT SCAN, NEUROLOGY ETC, WITH NO FAVORABLE SOLUTION. IT WAS A THOUGHT SHE MIGHT HAVE CONTRACTED ENCEPHALITIS SOMEWHERE BUT THAT WAS RULED OUT IN NEUROLOGIC CONSULTATION AND EVALUATION ON 7/8/91. ON 4/1/90 SHE WAS FORCED TO RETIRE EARLY DUE TO HER TREMULOUSNESS AND NERVES. HER ILLNESS DID NOT IMPROVE AND IN 11/91 SHE WAS AWARDED SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY BECAUSE OF HER DETERIORATING HEALTH. IN SUMMARY, SHE HAS SUFFERED 15 YEARS WITH WHAT SHE WOULD CALL IMPLANT POISONING. THE DOCTOR SAYS IT ISN'T THE IMPLANTS BECAUSE THEY ARE SALINE. SHE DOES NOT BELIEVE THIS, BECAUSE EVERY TEST GIVEN HAS SHOWN UP NEGATIVE. HER HUSBAND AND SHE ARE STRESSED OUT AND ARE NERVOUS WRECKS.

IN TIME THESE STARTED TO GIVE ME PAIN AND HAD CAPSULAR CONTRACTIONS AND THEY STARTED RIDING HIGH AND THEY WERE SO SEVERE THAT HE SUGGESTED THAT WITH HIS PTS WITH THIS PROBLEM HE OPTED FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE SILICONE AND REPLACE THEM WITH 2 POLYURETHANE IMPLANTS WHICH WOULD ADHERE BETTER AND YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SUCH CONTRACTIONS. I DID THIS AND HAD THIS PROCEDURE PERFORMED AT HIS SURGICAL SUITE ON 7/2/90. SEE NOTES AT END OF HISTORY OF IMPLANTS. HAD REGULAR MAMMOGRAMS AND IN THE LATTER PART OF 1991 I WAS FEELING A LUMP IN MY LEFT BREAST EVEN THOUGH THE LATEST MAMMOGRAM DID NOT SHOW ANYTHING. I REQUESTED ANOTHER MAMMOGRAM AT A DIFFERENT LOCATION AND THIS SHOWED NOTHING. ASKED MY DR IF I COULD HAVE A WRITTEN PRESCRIPTION TO HAVE A SONOGRAM PERFORMED AND I DID AND SURE ENOUGH I DID HAVE A LUMP. WENT TO SEE MY PLASTIC SURGEON AND HE REFERRED ME TO THE ONE OF THE FINEST BREAST SURGEONS. WENT TO SEE HIM FIRST OF JANUARY AND HE SCHEDULED ME FOR A BIOPSY ON 1/13/92 AND WHEN WE GOT THE REPORT BACK IT WAS CANCEROUS AND SO I WENT TO SEE HIM THE NEXT DAY AND WE DISCUSSED THE DIFFERENT PROCEDURES, ETC. AND HE BOOKED ME FOR SURGERY ON 1/21/1992. I OPTED FOR A MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY BECAUSE I DID HAVE THE SILICONE IMPLANT IN THE BREAST AND WAS DEVASTED WITH THE FACT THAT I HAD CANCER. I HAD THIS PROCEDURE AND HAD THE SAME PLASTIC SURGEON DO THE RECONSTRUCTION WITH A SALINE EXPANDER. THE VERY NEXT MORNING THE PLASTIC SURGEON TOLD ME AT THE HOSP THAT HE WAS SURE THE SALINE HAD RUPTURED AND TO CALL HIM THE FOLLOWING WEEK TO SET UP AN APPOINTMENT TO REPLACE THE SALINE, WHICH I DID. FOLLOWING THIS SALINE IMPLANT I HAD SEVERE REJECTION AND CONTRACTURES WHICH ONCE AGAIN THE IMPLANT STARTED TO MOVE UPWARDS. WENT BACK TO PLASTIC SURGEON WE DISCUSSED THE PAST IMPLANT HISTORY AND THAT THE POLYURETHANE COATED IMPLANTS SEEM TO BE THE ONLY ONES WHICH WORKED. THAT THIS WOULD BE THE ONLY OPTION BUT THAT I HAD TO SIGN A WAIVER. HE NEVER AT ANY TIME INFORMED ME OF THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OR HEALTH RISK INVOLVED WITH THESE TYPES OF IMPLANTS, BUT I HAD NO INFO FROM THE MFR OR INFO REGARDING THESE IMPLANTS NOR DID I KNOW THAT THE FDA STOPPED THE MFRS FROM MAKING THE POLYURETHANE IMPLANTS UNTIL I REQUEST THE BREAST IMPLANT, 1998 FROM THE FDA. I HAD STARTED TO HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS: SKIN RASHES, ALLERGIES, REDNESS, JOINT SWELLING AND SUSPECTED THAT THIS WAS FROM A SEVERE ALLERGY FROM POLYURETHANE COATING, ITCHNESS WITHIN BREAST ESPECIALLY MY LEFT BREAST (MASTY. BREAST). THIS WENT ON FOR OVER SIX YEARS. WENT FROM DR TO DR TO SPECIALIST BACK TO MY OWN DRS, ONCOLOGIST, INTERNIST, GYN, PLASTIC SURGEON AND GOT NO REAL INFO. ALSO HAD SEVERE PAINS IN BOTH BREASTS, CONTRACTIONS. FINALLY IN JUNE OF 1998 AFTER SEEING 11 DERMATOLOGISTS, 2 ALLERGISTS, ETC., I WENT TO SEE MY ONCOLOGIST AND ASKED FOR AN MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING BREAST TEST AND I HAD ONE DONE ON 7/2/98. RESULTS OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING STATE THAT REACTIVE FLUID CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, AND CONTAINED OTHER INFO. I HAD THESE FAXED TO ALL MY DRS, NO ONE GAVE ME ANY INFO REGARDING THIS MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING TEST. WENT AND SAW DRS ONCE AGAIN! GOT NOWHERE; TOLD THEM I THOUGHT IMPLANTS WERE CAUSE OF MY BEING ILL. RASHES, ALLERGIES ARE WORSE THAN MY RIGHT BREAST ENLARGED TO ABOUT TWO SIZES LARGER, RED RASHES, ITCHY, VEINS POPPING, EXTREME PAIN, FEVER IN LEFT BREAST, AND OTHER SYMPTOMS WERE MISSING IN RIGHT BREAST WHEN I DISCOVERED A LUMP UNDER MY RIGHT ARMPIT. CALLED MY BREAST SURGEON GOT AN APPOINTMENT 10/9/98, AND HE GAVE ME ANTIOBIOTICS BUT GAVE ME AN APPOINTMENT AT HIS MEDICAL SUITE TO HAVE A BIOPSY ON 10/14/98. HE REMOVED MY LYMPH NODE AND AFTER PATHOLOGIST REPORT CAME IN AS BENIGN. OTHER REPORTS WERE NOT IN AND I CALLED TO HAVE THEM FAX THE RESULTS AND IT SHOWED I HAD FOREIGN MATERIAL CONSISTENT WITH SILICONE AND THERE WAS A TAN FLESHY SUBSTANCE IN THE RIGHT AUXILLARY LYMPH NODE AND ALSO GIANT REACTIVE FLUID PRESENT, ETC. I FAXED THIS INFO TO MY ONCOLOGIST, PLASTIC SURGEON, WENT TO SEE THEM BUT NOTHING AS FAR AS WHAT I KNEW WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS AND THEIR CONCLUSIONS. FOUND OUT WHO WAS THE MEDICAL ADVISOR AND DIRECTOR FOR CANCER AT THE HOSP WHERE I RESIDE AND WENT TO SEE A DR ON 12/3/98 WITH MY HISTORY. HE JUST CONSULTS AND HE AFTER GOING THROUGH ALL THE PAPERS AND DOCUMENTS I BROUGHT IN CONCURRED WITH ME THAT I NEEDED TO HAVE MY IMPLANTS REMOVED AND RECOMMENDED AND SENT MY INFO TO A DR. APPOINTMENT SET FOR 3/1/99. ALSO GOT IN TOUCH WITH WOMEN IN THE IMPLANT TASK FORCE IN THE BACK OF THE BREAST IMPLANT UPDATED 1998 BOOK AND THEY RECOMMENDED A DR."|UNIMED POLYURETHANE - COATED PROSTHESES|UNK|02/23/1999|A||*|Y||205138.0|0HP|FTR|3.0||POLYURETHANE - COATED SILICONE IMPLANTS|Y|UNK|2317 EATON LN||RACINE|US|MEDICAL ENGINEERING CORP A BRISTOL MYERS SQUIBB CO.||WI|53404||UNK|LEFT|True

512539|366537|D|1||PT IS NOT AND HAS NEVER BEEN A PART OF ANY LIGITATION CONCERNING ANY MATTERS REGARDING BREAST IMPLANTS. IN 2001 PT HAD SURGERY PERFORMED BY DR IN HIS CLINIC TO REMOVE BOTH RUPTURED SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. PT WAS TOLD THAT THE DR HAD TO REMOVE A CAPSULE AND SOME BREAST TISSUE DURING THE SURGERY, AND WAS TOLD THAT SINCE HE HAD TO REMOVE ALOT OF BREAST TISSUE DURING THE SURGERY THAT PT WOULD BE BETTER OFF USING SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE RUPTURED IMPLANTS. HE ADVISED THEM THAT PT WOULD NOT BE HAPPY WITH THE SALINE IMPLANTS. THE DR TOLD THEM THAT PT WOULD HAVE TO SIGN A RELEASE WHICH PT DID NOT READ THOROUGHLY AND SIGNED ON THE DAY OF SURGERY. THE DR DID NOT ADVISE THEM THAT THE SILICONE IMPLANT THAT HE WAS USING ON THEM WAS ACTUALLY A NEW PRODUCT THAT WAS BEING TESTED ON THE MARKET. PT FOUND THIS OUT AFTER PT RESEARCHED THE SILICONE IMPLANT THAT HE USED ON THEM ON THE INTERNET. INAMED WAS THE SUPPLIER OF THEIR SILICONE IMPLANT AND APPARENTLY THEY ARE TRYING TO GET FDA APPROVAL FOR THE RELEASE OF THIS SILICONE IMPLANT ONTO THE USA MARKETPLACE. PT IS IN NEED OF SURGERY TO REMOVE THE IMPLANTS DUE TO A RUPTURE IN RIGHT IMPLANT. PT HAS A VERY LARGE LUMP ON THE SIDE OF THEIR RIGHT BREAST, AND PT FEARS THAT PT MAY LOOSE ENTIRE RIGHT BREAST SINCE PT DOES NOT HAVE ALOT OF BREAST TISSUE REMAINING. PT WAS NOT ADVISED BY THE DR OF THE RISKS OF TESTING THIS NEW IMPLANT ON THEM NOR DID HE ADVISE THEM THAT THIS IMPLANT WAS ACTUALLY A NEW TESTING PRODUCT. PT FEELS THIS INAMED IMPLANT MUST NEVER BE RELEASED INTO THE MARKET. IT IS DANGEROUS AND RUPTURES EASILY. PT CALLED INAMED TO ADVISE THEM THAT THEY HAD NOTIFIED THEM VIA THEIR INTERNET WEB SITE ABOUT THE RUPTURE VIA THE MANNER THAT THEY REQUEST ON THE WEB SITE. AND DID NOT HEAR BACK FROM THE CO TO DATE. YESTERDAY PT CALLED INAMED IN CALIFORNIA AND SPOKE WITH THEIR PRODUCT SUPPORT DEPARTMENT - THIS AFTER PT'S DR COULD NOT ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THE IMPLANT FOR PT, AND AFTER SEVERAL DAYS OF THE DR AVOIDING THEIR TELEPHONE CALLS. PT ASKED THEIR DR IF HE HAD REPORTED RUPTURE TO THE FDA AND HE SAID NO, A QUARTERLY BASIS. PT ASKED INAMED IF THEY WOULD PLEASE VIDEO TAPE THE REMOVAL OF THE RUPTURED IMPLANT FOR MEDICAL LEARNING, AND FOR THE PUBLIC TO BECOME MORE AWARE OF THE PROBLEMS INHERENT WITH THESE IMPLANTS. THEY REFUSED TO CONSIDER PT'S OFFER TO VIDEO TAPE THE REMOVAL, AND STATED TO PT THAT NO DR THAT THEY SUPPLY IMPLANTS TO WOULD APPROVE VIDEO TAPING OF A REMOVAL. FURTHER THEY COULD NOT SUPPLY TO PT ANY DATA ON THE SAFETY OF THE IMPLANT THAT WAS IMPLANTED IN PT. THE DR THAT IMPLANTED THE SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS IN PT IN 2001 IS NOT COOPERATING WITH QUESTIONS. AND THEY ADVISED PT THAT IT WOULD BE TO PTS ADVANTAGE TO USE THE SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS AGAIN. HE TOLD PT THAT PT WAS HIS FIRST RUPTURE, AND THAT PT'S RUPTURE WAS HIGHLY UNUSUAL. THIS PT HAS LEARNED IS NOT THE CASE, INDEED THERE HAVE BEEN MANY RUPTURES. PT BELIEVES THAT THEIR DR MAY ALSO BE A SHAREHOLDER OF INAMED STOCK AND THEREFORE PUSHED PT INTO THIS IMPLANT USAGE WITHOUT INFORMING PT OF ITS RISKS PROPERLY, IN ORDER TO GAIN SOMETHING IN RETURN FOR ASSISTING INAMED IN FINDING PARTICIPANTS FOR ITS SILICONE GEL IMPLANT STUDY. PT IS OUTRAGED THAT PT HAS BEEN USED IN THIS MANNER BY A DR WHO PT TRUSTED TO ADVISE THEM AS TO WHAT WOULD BE MOST APPROPRIATE FOR THEM AND SAFE. PT MUST UNDERGO SURGERY TO REMOVE THE IMPLANTS IMMEDIATELY. PT ASKS IF FDA WOULD BE INTERESTED IN VIDEO TAPING THE REMOVAL FOR EDUCATIONAL AND MEDICAL PURPOSES. PT WOULD ALSO LIKE TO TESTIFY IN ANY HEARING THAT FDA MAY HAVE REGARDING SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. PT ALSO LEARNED THAT PLASTIC SURGEONS DO NOT KEEP EACH OTHER INFORMED OF RUPTURE RATES, POSSIBLE CAUSES OF RUPTURES, OR ANY OTHER PROBLEMS RELATING TO BREAST IMPLANTS. AN INTERNET SITE MUST BE SET-UP FOR DRS TO TRACK, REPORT, AND STAY UPDATED REGARDING BREAST IMPLANT COMPLICATIONS. THIS SHOULD BE FEDERALLY MANDATED. THE PUBLIC SHOULD ALSO BE ALLOWED ACCESS TO THIS INFO, THUS ALLOWING CONSUMERS TO HAVE THE NECESSARY AND RELEVANT DATA REGARDING EACH AND EVERY IMPLANT DEVICE ON THE MARKET AND ITS PERFORMANCE RECORDS. EACH AND EVERY IMPLANT DEVICE THAT IS RELEASED INTO THE MARKETPLACE MUST BE TRACKED AND DOCUMENTED UNTIL ITS REMOVAL. THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO EFFECTIVELY TRACK BREAST IMPLANTATION AND ITS EFFECTS. THE FDA MUST ENACT STRICT GUIDELINES ON THE MEDICAL PROFESSION REGARDING BREAST IMPLANTATION, WITH THIS TRACKING METHOD -- IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT. INAMED MUST BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR EACH AND EVERY IMPLANT DEVICE THAT LEAVES THEIR PRODUCTION FACILITIES. PT IS VERY UPSET THAT THE FDA IS NOT MONITORING INAMED AND THE PLASTIC SURGEONS MORE CLOSELY. PT BELIEVES THAT THERE IS ALOT OF CORRUPTION, GOING ON AT INAMED AND ITS PARTNERING WITH DRS THAT IS COMPROMISING WOMEN'S HEALTH. PT WILL BE CONTACTING THE OPRAH WINFREY SHOW IF PT DOES NOT HEAR FROM THE FDA, AND REPORTING THESE PROBLEMS TO HER AND A NATIONWIDE AUDIENCE. PT WILL ALSO LOOK INTO REMOVING THEIR RUPTURED SILICONE IMPLANTS ON NATIONAL TELEVISION TO ALLOW WOMEN TO SEE FIRST HAND THE DEVASTATING AND DANGEROUS EFFECTS OF SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS ON WOMEN'S HEALTH, AND THE RECKLESS, HAPHAZARD MANNER IN WHICH INAMED AND PLASTIC SURGEONS ARE CONDUCTING THEIR OPERATIONS. IT WILL SHOCK THE NATION, IN ADDITION PT IS ASTONISHED THAT THE FDA ALLOWS BREAST IMPLANTS OF ANY KIND TO CONTINUE TO BE IMPLANTED PT WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY. THE FDA MUST ISSUE AN IMMEDIATE ORDER REQUIRING ANY WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS IN THE USA TO REMOVE THEM IMMEDIATELY DUE TO HEALTH RISKS AND THE VERY LIKELIHOOD OF RUPTURES AND COMPLICATONS.|INAMED - MCGHAN MEDICAL CORPORATION|*|02/07/2004|*|||Y||501548.0|*|FTR|1.0||STYLE 120 300CC GEL-FILLED MAMMARY IMPLANT|Y|*|*||*|US|INAMED CORP||CA|*||*|*|True

DEVICE LABELING ADDRESS THE EVENT OF SWELLING AS: FOR PRIMARY AUGMENTATION PTS, SWELLING RATE = 9.2 PERCENT. PRIMARY RECONSTRUCTION PTS = 8.4 PERCENT. SILICONE PT BROCHURE: FOLLOWING BREAST AUGMENTATION, YOU SHOULD CONTINUE TO PERFORM BREAST SELF-EXAMINATION MONTHLY. THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH A BREAST IMPLANT IN PLACE. TO CONTINUE TO PERFORM A MONTHLY BREAST SELF EXAMINATION EFFICIENTLY, YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU IDENTIFY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLANT AND YOUR BREAST TISSUE. BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE IMPLANT FROM BREAST TISSUE WILL DECREASE THE NECESSITY OF EXCESSIVE SQUEEZING OF THE IMPLANT DURING EXAMINATION. ANY NEW LUMPS SHOULD BE EVALUATED WITH A BIOPSY, AS APPROPRIATE. IF A BIOPSY IS PERFORMED, BE SURE TO INFORM THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL PERFORMING THE BIOPSY THAT YOU HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS SO THAT CARE WILL BE TAKEN TO AVOID INJURING THE IMPLANT.|UNK GEL BREAST IMPLANT|UNK GEL BREAST IMPLANT|01/30/2014|||DA|N|R||0HP|FTR|1.0||nan||NI|||GOLETA|US|ALLERGAN||CA|||||True
4925516|17832768|N|1||(B)(4). POTENTIAL STUDIES INDICATE THAT BREAST CANCER IS NO MORE COMMON IN WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS THAN THOSE WITHOUT IMPLANTS. A LARGE, LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP FOUND NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE RISK RATES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CANCERS, INCLUDING STOMACH CANCER, LEUKEMIA, AND LYMPHOMA. IN THE (B)(4) STUDY, AT LEAST 1 REOPERATION WAS PERFORMED ON 315 PTS (36.5%) THROUGH 10 YEARS. A TOTAL OF 424 REOPERATIONS WERE PERFORMED. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR REOPERATION THROUGH 10 YEARS ON AUGMENTATION PATIENTS WAS IMPLANT DEFLATION AT 21.7%. THE PERCENTAGE OF REOPERATIONS DUE TO LUMP/MASS/CYST INCREASED FROM 8.5% OF 293 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 5 YEARS TO 13.9% OF 424 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 10 YEARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF LUMPS, MASSES, AND CYSTS CAN BE EXPECTED TO NATURALLY INCREASE AS PTS AGE AND COULD BE AN EXPLANATION FOR THE INCREASE. IN RARE INSTANCES, ACUTE INFECTION MAY OCCUR IN A BREAST WITH IMPLANTS. THE SIGNS OF ACUTE INFECTION INCLUDE ERYTHEMA, TENDERNESS, FLUID ACCUMULATION, PAIN, AND FEVER. VERY RARELY, TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME, A POTENTIALLY LIFE-THREATENING CONDITION, HAS BEEN REPORTED IN WOMEN AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY. IT IS CHARACTERIZED BY SYMPTOMS THAT OCCUR SUDDENLY AND INCLUDE HIGH FEVER (102 DEGREE F, 38.8 DEGREE C OR HIGHER), VOMITING, DIARRHEA, A SUNBURN-LIKE RASH, RED EYES, DIZZINESS, LIGHTHEADEDNESS, MUSCLE ACHES, AND DROPS IN BLOOD PRESSURE, WHICH MAY CAUSE FAINTING. PTS SHOULD BE ADVISED TO CONTACT A PHYSICIAN IMMEDIATELY FOR DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT FOR ANY OF THESE SYSTEMS. POTENTIALS ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, SYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY.

CALCIUM DEPOSITS CAN FORM IN THE TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT WITH SYMPTOMS THAT MAY INCLUDE PAIN AND FIRMNESS. LYMPHADENOPATHY HAS ALSO BEN REPORTED IN SOME WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS. USE CARE IN SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURES SUCH AS OPEN CAPSULOTOMY, BREAST POCKET REVISION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA ASPIRATION, AND BIOPSY/LUMPECTOMY TO AVOID DAMAGE TO THE IMPLANT. PT SHOULD PERFORM BREAST SELF-EXAMINATIONS MONTHLY AND BE SHOWN HOW TO DISTINGUISH THE IMPLANT FROM THEIR BREAST TISSUE. THE PT SHOULD NOT MANIPULATE OR SQUEEZE THE EXCESSIVELY. THE PT SHOULD BE TOLD THAT THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGE IN THE IMPLANT SHAPE MAY BE SIGNS OF SYMPTOMATIC RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. IF THE PT HAS ANY OF THESE SIGNS, SHE SHOULD BE TOLD TO REPORT THEM, AND POSSIBLY HAVE AN MRI EVAL TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. THE NATRELLE CORE STUDY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE LONG-TERM (10 YEARS) SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PROD. IN ADDITION, ALLERGAN HAS INITIATED A SEPARATE LARGE 10-YEAR POSTAPPROVAL STUDY (BREAST IMPLANT F/U STUDIES, OR BIFS) TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC ISSUES WHICH ALLERGAN'S CORE STUDY WAS NOT DESIGNED TO FULLY ANSWER, AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE A REAL-WORLD ASSESSMENT OF SOME ENDPOINTS. THE ENDPOINTS IN THE BIFS LARGE POSTAPPROVAL STUDY INCLUDE LONG-TERM LOCAL COMPLICATIONS, CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE (CTD), CTD SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS, NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE, NEUROLOGICAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS, OFFSPRING ISSUES, REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES, CANCER SUICIDE, MAMMOGRAPHY ISSUES, AND MRI COMPLIANCE AND RESULTS. ALLERGAN WILL UPDATE THEIR LABELING ON A REGULAR BASIS WITH THE RESULTS OF THESE TWO STUDIES. THERE WAS 1 PRIMARY AUGMENTATION PT WITH A NEW DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER THROUGH 7 YEARS IN THE CORE STUDY. THERE WAS A 13% BENIGN BREAST DISEASE RATE AND 1% MALIGNANT BREAST DISEASE RATE. FOR REVISION-AUGMENTATION PTS, THERE WAS 1 PT WITH A NEW DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER. THER WAS A 15% BENIGN BREAST DISEASE RATE AND A 1% MALIGNANT BREAST DISEASE RATE THROUGH 7 YEARS. IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION PTS THERE WAS 1 REPORT OF THYROID CANCER AND 1 REPORT OF BRAIN CANCER. THERE WERE NO REPORTS OF OTHER CANCERS, SUCH AS RESPIRATORY OR CERVICAL/VULVAR, IN REVISION-AUGMENTATION PTS. THERE WERE 8 PRIMARY RECONSTRUCTION PTS (8%) WITH NEW REPORTS OF BREAST CANCER THROUGH 7 YEARS IN THE CORE STUDY. THERE WAS A 17% BENIGN BREAST DISEASE RATE AND A 10% MALIGNANT BREAST DISEASE RATE THROUGH 7 YEARS. FOR REVISION RECONSTRUCTION PTS, THERE WERE NO REPORTS OF NEW DIAGNOSES OR REOCCURRENCE OF BREAST CANCER. THERE WAS A 7% BENIGN BREAST DISEASE RATE THROUGH 7 YEARS.

5004369|23148611|D|1||I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY CORRESPONDENCE FROM MENTOR ABOUT PROBLEMS OR FAULTY IMPLANTS OR ANY IMPLANT STUDY; NEITHER HAVE ANY OF MY FRIENDS WHO HAD IMPLANTS DUE TO CANCER. IN 1990 I HAD A LEFT BREAST RECONSTRUCTED AFTER A MASTECTOMY IN 1989. I HAD ONLY ONE TROUBLE-FREE YEAR WITH THE MENTOR BECKER PROSTHESIS. I COMPLAINED OFTEN TO MY PS DOCTOR THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS CAUSING SEVERE ITCHING, CHANGING SHAPE AND MAKING LUMPY SPOTS ON MY TORSO. IN 2002, I HAD XRAYS SHOWING ALL THE SALINE HAD LEAKED OUT AND THE SILICONE WAS LEAKING INTO THE BROKEN SALINE BAG. THE PS AGREED TO TAKE IT OUT, BUT WANTED TO REPLACE IT WITH A DIFFERENT KIND, A MENTOR SALINE PRODUCT. I WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A QUICK SURGERY AND GO HOME THAT DAY; INSTEAD, THE SURGERY TOOK FOUR HOURS, I SPENT SEVERAL PAINFUL DAYS IN THE HOSPITAL AND A WEEK AT HOME OFF WORK. I WAS TOLD THAT THE SILICONE IMPLANT HAD BROKEN IN MY CHEST WALL AND IT HAD TO BE CLEANED AND WASHED OUT. IN 2008, MY HEALTH STARTED A FAST DETERIORATION. DURING THE NEXT FEW YEARS MY GP DOCTOR BEGAN TO RUN VARIOUS TESTS ON ME AND SAW A PATTERN. I WAS HAVING IMMUNE SYSTEM PROBLEMS, AND MANY TESTS THAT HAD BEEN OK BEGAN TO BE OFF NORMAL. HE KNEW THAT I HAD THAT NEW BREAST IMPLANT AFTER THE FIRST ONE RUPTURED. WHEN THE ANA LUPUS TEST WAS POSITIVE AND SEVERAL RELATED TESTS WERE BAD, HE TOLD ME HE THOUGHT I SHOULD SEE A RHEUMATOLOGIST. BOTH DOCTORS TOLD ME TO HAVE THE IMPLANT REMOVED. I WENT TO SEE MY PLASTIC SURGEON ONLY TO FIND OUT HE WAS MOVING TO ANOTHER STATE AND SEMI-RETIRING. HE ALSO SAID AFTER MY SURGERY HE NO LONGER WORKED WITH SILICONE IMPLANTS. HE INTRODUCED ME TO A NEW PLASTIC SURGEON WHO TAUGHT AT THE MEDICAL SCHOOL. I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH HER TO SEE IF SHE WOULD REMOVE MY IMPLANT AND TOLD HER ABOUT MY MEDICAL PROBLEMS. SHE SAID THERE WAS NO HARD EVIDENCE THAT BREAST IMPLANTS CAUSED THEM AND CONVINCED ME I SHOULD THINK ABOUT HOW MY BODY WOULD LOOK WITHOUT THE IMPLANT. I WENT HOME AND TRIED TO DEAL WITH MY HEALTH PROBLEMS, AND SAW MY RHEUMATOLOGIST. MY TESTS WERE GETTING WORSE, I BARELY WALKED WITH A CANE, MY EYES AND GUMS WERE INFECTED, MY JOINTS WERE INFLAMED, MY HAIR WAS FALLING OUT AND MY SKIN WAS PUFFY. HE TOLD ME I NEEDED TO GET THE IMPLANT TAKEN OUT SOON BECAUSE EVEN A LITTLE BIT OF SILICONE LIKE THE COVER OF THE IMPLANT WOULD WORSEN THE AUTOIMMUNE RESPONSE OF MY BODY. I WENT BACK TO THE NEW PLASTIC SURGEON, BUT THIS TIME I SHOWED HER I SHOWED HER MY OFFICIAL HOSPITAL SURGERY REPORTS. AFTER SHE SAW THEM, SHE LOOKED UP SOME MORE ABOUT IT AND FOUND THAT MY FIRST IMPLANT WAS SO BADLY RUPTURED THAT THE SURGEONS COULDN'T GET ALL OF IT AND EVEN THE BACK PORTION OF THE FIRST IMPLANT WAS STILL STUCK TO MY CHEST WALL OVER MY HEART. SHE EXPLAINED HOW DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE TO GET THAT OUT, BUT SHE COMPLETELY CHANGED HER MIND ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE RUPTURE AND SILICONE ON MY HEALTH. SHE PRESCRIBED A BREAST SURGEON AND AN MRI, WHICH SHOWED SILICONE MIGRATED ALL OVER MY MID, LEFT, AND SIDE TORSO AND THE WHOLE BACK OF THE IMPLANT WAS STUCK TO MY RIBS, AND THE SALINE CAPSULE HAD RUPTURED. MY IMMUNE SYSTEM HAD BUILT A SCAR TISSUE WALL AROUND IT TRYING TO GET RID OF IT ALL. LONG STORY SHORT: I HAD A SIX HOUR SURGERY (B)(6) 2012 WITH TWO SURGEONS AND TWO RESIDENT PS'S, FOR AN EXPLANTATION AND MASTECTOMY OF MY RIGHT BREAST. THEY CLEANED OFF ALL THE SILICONE THEY COULD FIND INCLUDING THE BACK PIECE OF THE IMPLANT OVER MY HEART. MY PS WAS SMILING WHEN SHE CAME IN TO TELL ME THE GOOD NEWS. I DON'T THINK SHE WILL EVER TELL ANOTHER WOMAN THAT THERE IS NO CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SILICONE IMPLANT AND HEALTH CONCERNS. MY HEALTH STARTED IMPROVING IMMEDIATELY BUT NOT THE OSTEOPOROSIS IN MY HIPS NOR MY JOINTS. I'VE HAD BOTH HIPS REPLACED AND STILL HAD ANA POSITIVE TESTS. I'M TOLD I HAD THE SILICONE IN MY SYSTEM TOO LONG. I LOST MORE THAN TEN YEARS OF A ONCE HEALTHY LIFE TO SILICONE POISONING. PS: I WAS NEVER COMPENSATED IN ANY WAY FOR THE BROKEN IMPLANTS AND WAS NOT AWARE OF ANY CLASS ACTION SUITS.|BECKER PROSTHESIS AND SALINE IMPLANT||08/10/2015||||*|R||I|FWM|0.0||BECKER PROSTHESIS AND SALINE IMPLANT|||||||MENTOR|||||||True

WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGAN'S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERS' BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MUFTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. USE CARE IN SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURES SUCH AS OPEN CAPSULOTOMY, BREAST POCKET REVISION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA ASPIRATION, AND BIOPSY/LUMPECTOMY TO AVOID DAMAGE TO THE IMPLANT SHELL OR VALVE. ANY POSTOPERATIVE EVACUATION OF HEMATOMA OR SEROMA MUST BE CONDUCTED WITH CARE TO AVOID BREAST IMPLANT CONTAMINATION, OR DAMAGE FROM SHARP INSTRUMENTS. THE USE OF MICROWAVE DIATHERMY IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST IMPLANTS IS NOT RECOMMENDED, AS IT HAS BEEN REPORTED TO CAUSE TISSUE NECROSIS, SKIN EROSION, AND EXTRUSION OF THE IMPLANT. ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE IN VIVO EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. PATIENTS SHOULD BE INFORMED THAT DISSATISFACTION WITH COSMETIC RESULTS RELATED TO SUCH THINGS AS SCAR DEFORMITY, HYPERTROPHIC SCARRING, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, INCORRECT SIZE, AND IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY MAY OCCUR. CAREFUL SURGICAL PLANNING AND TECHNIQUE CAN MINIMIZE, BUT NOT PRECLUDE, THE RISK OF SUCH RESULTS. PRE-EXISTING ASYMMETRY MAY NOT BE ENTIRELY CORRECTABLE. REVISION SURGERY MAY BE INDICATED TO MAINTAIN PATIENT SATISFACTION BUT CARRIES ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS AND RISKS.

THE ABSTRACT OF THIS ARTICLE WAS FIRST RECEIVED ON 11/09/2016. THIS EVENT WAS FIRST RECEIVED IN THE ABSTRACT. FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE AUTHOR REGARDING EVENT, PRODUCT, OR PATIENT DETAILS HAS BEEN REQUESTED. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. DEVICE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. BREAST IMPLANTS RUPTURE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. RUPTURES CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO RUPTURE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, STRESSING THE IMPLANT DURING IMPLANTATION AND WEAKENING IT, FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL, EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED), TRAUMA, COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING, AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF RUPTURE FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT. IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF RUPTURE. LABORATORY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RUPTURE ARE ONGOING. SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE. IF RUPTURE OCCURS, SILICONE GEL MAY EITHER REMAIN WITHIN THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), MOVE OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE (EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), OR MOVE OUTSIDE THE BREAST (GEL MIGRATION).

I HAD TO PAY FOR REMOVAL AND TESTING OF IMPLANTS AND TISSUE. THEY FOUND PROPIONIBACTERIUM. THIS BACTERIA DOES NOT SHOW UP ON STANDARD LAB TESTS, AND THE ONLY WAY FOR ME TO TELL OF INFECTION WAS REMOVAL. HERE'S MY STORY, TWO YEARS AGO, ON A BEAUTIFUL, SUNNY (B)(6) DAY, I WOKE UP TO A HUGE LUMP UNDER MY ARMPIT. IT COULD BARELY LIFT MY KIDS WITHOUT EXTREME PAIN.

WHAT MY PRIMARY DOCTOR LABELED AS AN ENLARGED LYMPH NODE FROM AN INFECTED HAIR FOLLICLE SOON ASPIRATED TO WHAT I NOW BELIEVE WAS THE BEGINNING OF MY BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESS. ONE MONTH LATER, WE WERE SURPRISED TO FIND OUT WE WERE PREGNANT WITH OUR 3RD BABY, OUR SWEET (B)(6). STILL UNSURE WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH MY BODY, THE PAIN AND LUMPS AROUND MY BREASTS AND ARMPITS ONLY INCREASED. ALL OF MY PHYSICIANS AT THIS POINT WERE CLUELESS. THEY CHALKED IT UP TO HORMONES. AFTER ALL, A WOMAN'S BODY IS EVER CHANGING DURING PREGNANCY. AFTER (B)(6) WAS BORN, I HAD MULTIPLE BREAST ULTRASOUNDS. ALL COMING BACK CLEAR. I WAS RELIEVED, NO CANCER.

I USED TO BE ABLE TO DO A MILLION THINGS AT ONE TIME, (MON LIFE??), AND NOW I HAD TO TELL MY BRAIN ONE THING AT A TIME.

5935385|54346448|D|1||IN (B)(6) 2003, I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER IN MY LEFT BREAST. I HAD A LUMPECTOMY WITH MULTIPLE LYMPH NODE REMOVAL AND WAS SCHEDULED FOR 40 ROUNDS OF RADIATION. BECAUSE I HAVE A SKIN DISORDER CALLED SOLAR URTICARIA, I KNEW I COULD NOT DO RADIATION BUT DOCTORS IN MY TOWN DID NOT KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT IT TO SAY YES OR NO. I WENT TO (B)(6) CLINIC DOWN IN (B)(6) AND HAD A BILATERAL MASTECTOMY. IN (B)(6) 2004, I HAD MY SURGERY WITH TEMPORARY EXPANDERS. WHEN MY BREAST WERE READY WE EXCHANGED THEM FOR SILICONE IMPLANTS. IN (B)(6) OF THAT SAME YEAR 2004, I BECAME ILL WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND WAS PLACED ON TWO MEDICINES. IN 2009, I HAD TO HAVE MY IMPLANTS REPLACED BECAUSE OF A RUPTURE IN THE RIGHT IMPLANT. THEY WERE REPLACED WITH A SECOND PAIR OF SILICONE IMPLANTS. I BECAME SERIOUSLY ILL IN (B)(6) OF 2012 WITH COLLAGENOUS COLITIS, HOSPITALIZED AND BATTLED THAT THREE SEPARATE TIMES. I WAS PUT ON A GLUTEN FREE, LOW-FAT, LOW FIBER RESIDUAL DIET FROM A VERY RENOWNED LOCAL G. I. DOCTOR. I TRIED AND EXPERIENCED A 2 GALLON (B)(6) BAG OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT DID NOT WORK FOR ME DURING THIS ENTIRE JOURNEY. A DIET THAT I STILL PRACTICE TO THIS DAY. I CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE STOMACH PAIN AND EXTREME NAUSEA. I BEGAN TO HAVE SEVERE JOINT AND MUSCLE ACHES WORSE THEN MY RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS HAD EVER BEEN. I SAW YET ANOTHER G. I. DOCTOR FROM (B)(6) (ONE OF THE BEST) AND VISITED (B)(6) CLINIC BOTH G. I., DEPARTMENT AND RHEUMATOLOGY TWO TIMES IN TWO SEPARATE YEARS. I'VE HAD ENDLESS COLONOSCOPIES, ENDOSCOPIES, BRAIN SCANS, PANCREAS PROTOCOL, EXTENSIVE BLOODWORK, 2 GASTRIC EMPTYING TEST, WITH ONE TEST INDICATING POSITIVE AT (B)(6). HOWEVER, THE SECOND TEST AT (B)(6) CLINIC SHOWED NEGATIVE. EVERY ORGAN IN MY BODY WAS CHECKED AND RECHECKED. SO ONCE AGAIN MY ILLNESS WAS UNDETERMINED AND UNEXPLAINED! NOW I HAD BEEN 3 1/2 YEARS. THANK GOODNESS I RETIRED THE YEAR I GOT ILL OR I WOULD HAVE BEEN FORCED TO QUIT. I FINALLY WAS TOLD BY THE RHEUMATOLOGIST AT (B)(6) CLINIC THAT IT WAS FIBROMYALGIA. IN (B)(6) 2016, I FOUND A SPECIALIST DR. (B)(6) IN (B)(6). HE FOUND OUT THAT I ALSO HAD MANY FOOD ALLERGIES, FOUR ACTIVE DNA CHILDHOOD VIRUSES AND A DEFICIENCY IN VITAMIN D. ALTHOUGH ONCE HE FOUND OUT I HAD BREAST IMPLANTS SILICONE, HE SUGGESTED I GET THEM OUT IMMEDIATELY. I HAD SPOKEN WITH MY PLASTIC SURGEON A YEAR AND A HALF AGO ABOUT THIS VERY ISSUE OF MY IMPLANTS BECAUSE MY RIGHT IMPLANT HAD BEEN BOTHERING ME AGAIN AND I WAS IN FEAR OF ANOTHER RUPTURE. WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM ABOUT WHAT DR. (B)(6) HAD SUGGESTED HE ALSO AGREED. I HAD AN EXPLANT ON (B)(6) 2016. I'M WRITING THIS ON (B)(6) 2016. NOTE: WHEN I WOKE UP FROM ANESTHESIA AFTER EXPLANT I HAD 0 JOINT PAIN. WE ARE WAITING FOR THE OTHER SYMPTOMS TO EITHER DISAPPEAR OR DIMINISH. OUT OF THE 63 SYMPTOMS OF BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESS, I HAD 36! THEREFORE, IT WILL TAKE ME A LONG TIME FOR MY BODY TO RECOVER, IF EVER FULLY. THIS DECISION TO REMOVE MY BREASTS FOR THE 2ND TIME WAS A DIFFICULT ONE ESPECIALLY WITH THIS OUTCOME. I DO NOT HAVE BREASTS BECAUSE OF MY BILATERAL MASTECTOMY.

I DID NOT HAVE MUCH FAT AT ALL TO HELP WITH THIS PROCEDURE. TODAY, I SAW MY PLASTIC SURGEON AND HE HAD TO DRAIN FLUID FROM THIS RIGHT BREAST AGAIN. SO WE ARE STILL DEALING WITH THIS SITUATION.
