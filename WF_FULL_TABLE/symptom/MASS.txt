THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CASES REFERENCED IN THE NOTICE IS 359, INCLUDING 9 DEATHS. THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE NOTICE CLASSIFIES THE ALCL EVENTS IN DIFFERENT CATEGORIES, INCLUDING TYPES OF DEVICE, ASSOCIATED ADVERSE EVENTS, PRESENTATION, AND DIAGNOSIS DETAILS, BUT DOES NOT IDENTIFY SPECIFIC DEVICES OR PATIENTS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO INDIVIDUALIZE THIS INFORMATION INTO SPECIFIC REPORTS, AND BY DEFINITION ALREADY INCLUDES EVENTS REPORTED BY ALLERGAN IN THE PAST. THEREFORE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH 21 CFR 803, THIS REPORT WILL REPRESENT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF RECEIPT OF THE NOTICE AND DOCUMENTATION OF ALLERGAN'S ATTEMPT TO INVESTIGATE ADVERSE EVENTS IDENTIFIED IN THAT NOTICE. THIS REPORT WILL NOT SUBSTITUTE FOR ANY INVESTIGATION INTO COMPLAINTS RECEIVED WHERE INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS OR ALLERGAN DEVICES ARE IDENTIFIED, INCLUSIVE OR EXCLUSIVE OF THE 359 CASES MENTIONED IN THE NOTICE. (B)(4). THE EVENTS OF DEATH, LYMPHOMA-ALCL, LYMPHOMA, SEROMA, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, AND BREAST LUMPS ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THESE EVENTS. SALINE DEVICE LABELING: RADIATION TO THE BREAST Â¿ ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE IN VIVO EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, ASYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER THESE ADDITIONAL SURGERIES. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF DEFLATION. ADDITIONAL COMPLICATIONS Â¿ AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. CALCIUM DEPOSITS CAN FORM IN THE TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT WITH SYMPTOMS THAT MAY INCLUDE PAIN AND FIRMNESS. LYMPHADENOPATHY HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED IN SOME WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS. IN THE PASS STUDY, AT LEAST 1 REOPERATION WAS PERFORMED ON 315 PATIENTS (36.5%) THROUGH 10 YEARS. A TOTAL OF 424 REOPERATIONS WERE PERFORMED. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR REOPERATION THROUGH 10 YEARS ON AUGMENTATION PATIENTS WAS IMPLANT DEFLATION AT 21.7%. THE PERCENTAGE OF REOPERATIONS DUE TO LUMP/MASS/CYST INCREASED FROM 8.5% OF 293 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 5 YEARS TO 13.9% OF 424 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 10 YEARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF LUMPS, MASSES, AND CYSTS CAN BE EXPECTED TO NATURALLY INCREASE AS PATIENTS AGE AND COULD BE AN EXPLANATION FOR THE INCREASE. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.

DEATHS MUST BE REPORTED TO ALLERGAN AND FDA. SILICONE DEVICE LABELING: ONE OF THE KEY COMPLICATIONS REPORTED IS CALLED Â¿CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE.Â¿ CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS A TIGHTENING OF THE SCAR TISSUE (ALSO CALLED A CAPSULE) THAT NORMALLY FORMS AROUND THE BREAST IMPLANT DURING THE HEALING PROCESS AFTER SURGERY. IN SOME WOMEN, THE SCAR TISSUE (CAPSULE) SQUEEZES THE IMPLANT. THIS RESULTS IN FIRMNESS OR HARDENING OF THE BREAST, AND IT IS A RISK FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE. DEGREES OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE ARE CLASSIFIED BY THE BAKER GRADING SCALE.1 CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BAKER GRADES III AND IV ARE THE MOST SEVERE. BAKER GRADE III OFTEN RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SURGERY (REOPERATION) BECAUSE OF PAIN AND POSSIBLY ABNORMAL APPEARANCE. BAKER GRADE IV USUALLY RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR REOPERATION BECAUSE OF PAIN AND UNACCEPTABLE APPEARANCE. DO NOT TREAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BY CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY OR FORCEFUL EXTERNAL COMPRESSION, WHICH WILL LIKELY RESULT IN IMPLANT DAMAGE, RUPTURE, FOLDS, AND/OR HEMATOMA. ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. YOU SHOULD PERFORM SELF-EXAMINATION OF YOUR BREASTS EVERY MONTH FOR CANCER SCREENING. HOWEVER, THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU DISTINGUISH THE IMPLANT FROM YOUR BREAST TISSUE. THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGES IN IMPLANT SHAPE, MAY BE SIGNS OF A RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. THESE SIGNS SHOULD BE REPORTED TO YOUR SURGEON AND POSSIBLY EVALUATED WITH AN MRI. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL.

BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. BREAST IMPLANTS RUPTURE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. RUPTURES CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO RUPTURE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, STRESSING THE IMPLANT DURING IMPLANTATION AND WEAKENING IT, FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL, EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED), TRAUMA, COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING, AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF RUPTURE FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT. IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF RUPTURE. LABORATORY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RUPTURE ARE ONGOING. SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE. IF RUPTURE OCCURS, SILICONE GEL MAY EITHER REMAIN WITHIN THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), MOVE OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE (EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), OR MOVE OUTSIDE THE BREAST (GEL MIGRATION). THERE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY THAT RUPTURE MAY PROGRESS FROM INTRACAPSULAR TO EXTRACAPSULAR AND BEYOND."""|STYLE 110 SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|110-420|05/17/2017||||N|R||0HP|FTR|1.0|04/15/2004|PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||49463|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. REPORTS IN THE MEDICAL LITERATURE INDICATE THAT PATIENTS WITH BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT AT A GREATER RISK THAN THOSE WITHOUT BREAST IMPLANTS FOR DEVELOPING BREAST CANCER. REPORTS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT BREAST IMPLANTS MAY INTERFERE WITH OR DELAY BREAST CANCER DETECTION BY MAMMOGRAPHY AND/OR BIOPSY; HOWEVER, OTHER REPORTS IN THE PUBLISHED MEDICAL LITERATURE INDICATE THAT BREAST IMPLANTS NEITHER SIGNIFICANTLY DELAY BREAST CANCER DETECTION NOR ADVERSELY AFFECT CANCER SURVIVAL OF WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS. A LARGE FOLLOW-UP STUDY REPORTED NO EVIDENCE OF AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND CANCER, AND EVEN SHOWED A DECREASED INCIDENCE OF BREAST CANCER COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION. ONE STUDY HAS REPORTED AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF BRAIN CANCER IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS AS COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION. THE INCIDENCE OF BRAIN CANCER, HOWEVER, WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS WHEN COMPARED TO WOMEN WHO HAD OTHER PLASTIC SURGERIES A PUBLISHED REVIEW OF 4 LARGE STUDIES IN WOMEN WITH COSMETIC IMPLANTS AND AN ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP STUDY CONCLUDED THAT THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT SUPPORT AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BRAIN CANCER AND BREAST IMPLANTS. AN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL REVIEW ALSO LENT SUPPORT TO THE LACK OF CAUSATION BETWEEN IMPLANTS AND ANY TYPE OF CANCER. STUDIES HAVE REPORTED AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF RESPIRATORY/LUNG CANCER IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS. OTHER STUDIES OF WOMEN IN SWEDEN AND DENMARK HAVE FOUND THAT WOMEN WHO GET BREAST IMPLANTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE CURRENT SMOKERS THAN WOMEN WHO GET BREAST REDUCTION SURGERY OR OTHER TYPES OF COSMETIC SURGERY. SEVERAL LARGE STUDIES HAVE FOUND NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND RESPIRATORY/LUNG CANCER. TWO STUDIES REPORTED AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF CERVICAL/VULVAR CANCER IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS. ANOTHER LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP STUDY SHOWED EQUIVALENT INCIDENCES OF CERVICAL CANCER IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION. OTHER RECENT LARGE STUDIES CONCLUDED THAT THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT SUPPORT AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM CANCERS AND BREAST IMPLANTS. THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL STUDIES PUBLISHED THAT EXAMINED THE RISK OF OTHER TYPES OF CANCERS, E.G., THYROID CANCERS, URINARY SYSTEM CANCERS, SARCOMA, ENDOCRINE CANCER, CONNECTIVE TISSUE CANCER, CANCER OF THE EYE, AND UNSPECIFIED CANCERS IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS.

SINCE 1998 I HAVE ALSO BEEN AFFLICTED WITH MIGRAINES, MULTIPLE CHEMICAL SENSITIVITIES, EPISODES OF VERTIGO, FEELING DIZZY MOST DAYS, EXTREME FATIGUE, MEMORY LOSS AND BRAIN FOG. THE LIST GOES ON AND ON. I AM CERTAIN THE CAUSE OF MY CONDITION IS FROM THE CHEMICALS IN THESE SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS I'VE BEEN CARRYING IN MY CHEST FOR NEARLY 35 YEARS. I AM CURRENTLY SEARCHING FOR A PLASTIC SURGEON WITH EXPERIENCE IN REMOVING SILICONE IMPLANTS ALONG WITH THE CAPSULE AND ANY RESIDUAL SILICONE PARTICLES AND AFFECTED LYMPH NODES. SINCE INSURANCE DOESN'T COVER THIS PROCEDURE I AM CURRENTLY UNABLE TO AFFORD TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH EXPLANTATION.

THE DHR ASSEMBLY REPORT FROM ORACLE WAS VERIFIED AND THERE WAS NOT ANY SCRAP RELATED WITH REPORTED EVENT, ALL DEVICES WERE CONFORMANCE DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS.

THE REPORTED DEVICE WAS INTACT AT THE TIME OF PRODUCTION AND MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. REPORTED EVENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN THE LABELING: ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. YOU SHOULD PERFORM SELF-EXAMINATION OF YOUR BREASTS EVERY MONTH FOR CANCER SCREENING. HOWEVER, THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU DISTINGUISH THE IMPLANT FROM YOUR BREAST TISSUE. THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGES IN IMPLANT SHAPE, MAY BE SIGNS OF A RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. THESE SIGNS SHOULD BE REPORTED TO YOUR SURGEON AND POSSIBLY EVALUATED WITH AN MRI. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM.

THESE WERE RPTR'S THIRD SET OF IMPLANTS. TWO PREVIOUS SETS WERE REMOVED DUE TO MIGRATION AND CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. IN LESS THAN 4 MONTHS THE RIGHT PROSTHESIS HAD SLIPPED UNDERNEATH THE PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE AND WAS DISPLACED INFERIORLY AND ALSO BULGED OUTWARD WHERE THERE WAS A WEAKNESS IN THE MUSCLE WITH HERNIATION OF THE PROSTHESIS. ON 12/13/82, RPTR HAD FURTHER RECONSTRUCTION OF THE RIGHT CHEST WALL. THE SURGERY REPORT IS NOT CLEAR AS TO WHETHER THE OLD PROSTHESIS OR A NEW ONE IS USED.

""GROSS DIAGNOSIS, SPECIMENS 1 AND 2, TWO MAMMARY PROSTHESIS WITH RUPTURE."" WHEN RPTR DISCUSSED THIS WITH HER DR HE REPLIED THIS WAS NOT AN UNUSUAL OCCURRENCE WHEN REMOVING IMPLANTS.

IN THE ALMOST 13 YRS SINCE HER FIRST BREAST SURGERY AT AGE 40 THERE HAS NOT BEEN ONE DAY THAT SHE HAS BEEN COMPLETELY PAIN-FREE. THE EMOTIONAL SCARRING IS EQUALLY EVIDENT.

THE RPTR HAD A NEEDLE-DIRECTED CT BIOPSY WHICH SHOWED SILICONE AND GIANT CELLS. THE RPTR WAS INJECTED WITH FLUROINATED GLUCOSE AFTER WHICH A PET SCAN WAS DONE WHICH SHOWED THE TWO LYMPH NODES.

20211|14895|D|1||BECAUSE OF FIBROCYSTIC DISEASE, RPTR HAD RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY 12/20/76 WITH ANOTHER CO'S IMPLANTS. DUE TO SCAR CONTRACTURE AND TWO UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS AT CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, BOTH IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED AND THE SAME IMPLANTS WERE REINSERTED. IN 1979, THE LEFT IMPLANT WAS REPLACED WITH THIS CO'S DOUBLE LUMEN GEL/SALINE IMPLANT. AFTER EXPLANTATION SURGERY 8/17/94, LAB ANALYSIS REPORT FROM DR WAS OBTAINED EXPLAINING THE PROBLEMS WITH FAILED IMPLANTS. THE DEVICE FROM THE CONTAINER IDENTIFIED AS THE LEFT SIDE WAS EVIDENTLY THE REPLACEMENT FOR A FAILIED IMPLANT FROM THE PREVIOUS SURGERY. IT WAS IDENTIFIED AS A DOUBLE LUMEN CONSISTENT WITH PRODUCTION CIRCA 1977-78. THE CRITERIA OF IDENTIFICATION INCLUDE A LEAF VALVE EXCLUSIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CO'S PRODUCTS. THIS IS NOT A SALINE IMPLANT, IT IS A COMBINATION GEL WITH ADDED SALINE IN A SEPARATE COMPARMENT. THE LEFT IMPLANT HAD PERFORATED INNER AND OUTER SHELLS AND WAS SEVERELY CONTAMINATED BY TISSUE AND POSSIBLY MICRO-ORGANISMS AND THEIR METABOLITES. THE GEL LEAKED PROFUSELY THROUGH MULTIPLE PERFORATIONS. THE GEL WAS ALSO INVASIVE AND OF AN EASILY DISPERSED NATURE. THE LOSS OF GEL PROPERTY (REVERSION FROM A COHESIVE PRODUCT TO AN OIL-LIKE ENTITY) IS A SIGN OF CHEMICAL DEGRADATION. THE CAPSULE RECEIVED IN THE CONTAINER INDICATING THE RIGHT SIDE SHOWS A DISORGANIZED MASS OF TISSUE CONSISTENT WITH SEVERE ADVERSE REACTIONS AND FAILURE OF THE CAPSULE TO CONTAIN THE DEBRIS OF A GROSSLY LEAKING PROSTHESIS. IT ALSO INDICATES MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS AT CLOSED CAPSULOTOMIES AND POSSIBLE INFECTION. NODULAR PORTIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH GRANULOMATOUS MATERIALS FROM A PT WHO RECEIVED MULTIPLE IMPLANTS AND WHERE DEBRIDEMENT OF THE TISSUE (ABLATIVE CAPSULECTOMY) WAS NOT PERFORMED AT THE TIME OF PROSTHESIS REPLACEMENT. THE CAPSULE RECEIVED IN THE CONTAINER INDICATING THE LEFT SIDE WAS EXTENSIVELY CALCIFIED WITH PLAQUE-LIKE ENTITIES. THESE SUGGEST A PROLONGED EXPOSURE TO AGGRESSIVE CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES RESULTING IN NECROSIS AND MINERALIZATION. IT APPEARS MOST PROBLEM THAT THE CAPSULES WERE TRANSPOSED SOME TIME AFTER SURGERY. IN PRINCIPLE, THE CALCIFIED CAPSULE SHOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DOUBLE LUMEN IMPLANT. (ALSO SEE 1005399.)

12370|7267|D|1||HAVING HAD A HISTORY OF SEVERE FIBROCYSTIC BREAST DISEASE WITH RECURRENT BREAST BIOPSIES, RPTR WAS ADVISED BY TWO DRS THAT A BILATERAL SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY WITH RECONSTRUCTION WAS APPROPRIATE TREATMENT. BASED ON WHAT INFO WAS AVAILABLE TO HER, THE MEDICAL CONSENSUS AT THE TIME SEEMED TO BE THAT WOMEN WITH THIS PROBLEM HAD A HIGHER RATE OF BREAST CANCER COUPLED WITH A LOWER CURE RATE DUE TO THIS DIFFICULTY OF EARLY DETECTION. RPTR HAD BILATERAL SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY AND RECONSTRUCTION OF THE BREAST WITH  GEL IMPLANTS WITHOUT PATCHES ON 6/12/81 AT AGE 40. WITHIN 3 WKS RPTR COULD DETECT HARDNESS IN BOTH BREASTS. IN LESS THAN SIX MONTHS THESE WERE VERY PAINFUL AND THERE WAS MARKED CAPSULE FORMATION ON BOTH SIDES WITH SOME WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT. THROUGHOUT THIS SIX MONTH PERIOD SHE WAS TOLD TO VIGOROUSLY MASSAGE AND PULL THE IMPLANTS TO THE MIDLINE WHICH SHE DID IN SPITE OF THIS CAUSING FURTHER PAIN AS THE HARDNESS AND DEFORMITY INCREASED. ALSO AT THIS POINT THE LEFT IMPLANT HAD SHIFTED DOWN AND LATERALLY. RPTR WAS TOLD BY DR THAT HE MAY HAVE TO RELEASE THE SCAR SURGICALLY. IT WAS THEN RPTR DECIDED TO GET A SECOND OPINION. IT WAS ONLY THEN RPTR DISCOVERED THAT THE IMPLANTS WERE PLACED SUBMAMMARY NOT SUBPECTORAL AND WOULD HAVE TO BE REMOVED AND NEW IMPLANTS PLACED SUBPECTORALLY. HAVING HAD SEVEN SETS OF IMPLANTS, RPTR WONDERS WHAT THE LEVEL OF SILICONE IN HER BODY WOULD BE IF THERE WAS A TEST TO DETECT THE SUBSTANCE. IN THE ALMOST 13 YRS SINCE HER FIRST BREAST SURGERY AT AGE 40 THERE HAS NOT BEEN ONE DAY THAT SHE HAS BEEN COMPLETELY PAIN-FREE. THE EMOTIONAL SCARRING IS EQUALLY EVIDENT. IN ADDITION TO THE PAIN AND TRAUMA OF FIVE (SOON TO BE SIX) SURGERIES AND THE EVERYDAY PAIN AND DISCOMFORT IN THE BREAST AREA, RPTR HAS SLOWLY DEVELOPED OTHER PROBLEMS THAT SHE FEELS ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THESE IMPLANTS. THESE INCLUDE SEVERE MUSCLE PAIN, NUMBNESS AND TINGLING IN THE EXTREMITIES AND EVER INCREASING JOINT PAIN AND STIFFNESS. BUT BY FAR THE MOST PAINFUL IS A RECURRING RAW FEELING THAT CAN AND DOES APPEAR ON ANY AND ALL PARTS OF HER BODY FOR VERYING LENGTHS OF TIME, SOMETIMES WEEKS. SHE IS CURRENTLY TAKING ORUDIS, A NEWER ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUG AND FLEXERIL, A MUSCLE RELAXANT, WHICH RPTR HAS TAKEN FOR SEVERAL YRS WITH A LIMITED AMOUNT OF SUCCESS.

IN 10/92 AFTER DETECTING A ""STICKY"" FEELING IN THE LOWER PART OF HER RIGHT BREAST, SHE STOPPED THE VIGOROUS MASSAGING OF HER BREASTS WHICH HAD BEEN PRESCRIBED BY THE SURGEON. IT FELT AS IF THE UNDERSIDE OF HER SKIN WAS STICKING TO THE SURFACE OF THE IMPLANT. THE SURGEON ADVISED HER TO HAVE A MAMMOGRAM WHICH REVEALED NO APPARENT LEAKAGE.

DURING THE MANIPULATION OF THE RIGHT IMPLANT, THERE WAS SOME SALINE AND SILICONE GEL LEAKAGE, AND IT WAS DIFFICULT TO TELL WHETHER THIS WAS DUE TO SURGICAL MANIPULATION OR PREOPERATIVE RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT.

12046|9795|D|1||IN 1986, RPTR WENT TO SEE HER MD WITH THE PROBLEM OF FIBRO-ADENOSIS. THE OPTION OF BREAST IMPLANTS WAS RECOMMENDED. ANOTHER DR WENT OVER THE PROCEDURE WITH RPTR AND HER HUSBAND AT THAT TIME. HE DESCRIBED THE OPERATION AND THE OUTCOME. THE DR SAID SHE WOULD HAVE A TWO INCH SCAR THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE A STRETCH MARK. HER BREASTS WOULD BE LARGER AND FIRMER. HER FUTURE CHANCES OF CANCER WOULD BY 95% AGAINST CANCER. HER MOTHER HAS HAD A MASTECTOMY, SO THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT ADVANTAGE TO HER. QUESTIONS SHE ASKED INCLUDED, SINCE SHE WAS SPORTS ORIENTED, WOULD THESE IMPLANTS BREAK OR LEAK. SHE WAS TOLD THEY WOULD NOT. SHE ALSO ASSUMED THEY WERE FDA APPROVED. SHE HAD NO IDEA THAT A HOSP WOULD PERFORM A PROCEDURE THAT HAD NOT BEEN APPROVED. AFTER DISCUSSING THE PROCEDURE, AND THE POSSIBILITY OF FUTURE CANCER, SHE CHOOSE THE BREAST IMPLANTS. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE OPERATION SHE HAD PROBLEMS. SHE NO LONGER HAD A SEPARATION BETWEEN THE BREASTS. HER BREASTS WERE AND STILL ARE LUMPY. THEY WERE TWO DIFFERENCT SIZES AND STILL ARE. THE SCARS ARE STILL LARGE AND VERY DARK IN COLOR. SHE ALSO HAS ALOT OF PAIN IN HER RIGHT BREAST. COLLAGEN INJECTIONS WERE INJECTED INTO THE SCARS TO LIGHTEN THEM. THIS DID NOT HELP. A SECOND OPERATION WAS PERFORMED TO ADJUST THE LUMPY MASS AND TO SEPARATE THE BREASTS. THE LUMPS ARE STILL PRESENT. THE ORIGINAL IMPLANTS WERE REPLACED BACK INTO HER FOR A SECOND TIME. SHE LATER FOUND OUT THAT THIS PROCEDURE SAVES MONEY BY USING THE SAME IMPLANTS A SECOND TIME. THE BREASTS ARE SEPARATED NOW. SHE WAS TOLD THE SCARS WOULD FADE AND THE PAIN WOULD DECREASE AND TO BE PATIENT. AFTER MORE VISITS SHE WAS TOLD SHE LOOKED FINE. AGAIN, SHE WAS TOLD THE SCARS WOULD FADE AND THE PAIN WOULD DECREASE. SHE WAS TOLD SHE HAD EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS  AND TO SEEK HELP WITH HER EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS DEALING WITH HER BREAST IMPLANTS. SHE WAS TOLD SHE SHOULD BE GLAD THAT SHE WAS ALIVE. THIS STATEMENT ONLY AGITATED HER MORE. EARLY IN 1991 HER MD SENT HER TO ANOTHER DR WHO DID NOT THINK HER BREASTS LOOKED RIGHT EITHER. THE DR DISCUSSED DIFFERENT IMPLANTS, CORRECTING THE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE AND CORRECTING THE SCARS. SHE COULD NOT AFFORD THE COST OF THIS SURGERY. SHE FELT IT WAS A DETERRENT TO GET RID OF HER. SHE CURRENTLY HAS PAIN IN HER BREASTS. THERE IS ALSO A BLUE COLORED AREA IN ONE BREAST. MUSCLE AND JOINT PAIN FOR NO REASON. LUMPS AND CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE ARE ALSO A PROBLEM, CAUSING THE BREAST TO BE HARD AND ABNORMALLY SHAPED. SHE HAS ALSO HAD TO HAVE LUMPS IN HER FOOT GLAND SURGICALLY REMOVED. HER HANDS AND FEET SWELL FOR NO REASON. UNEXPLAINED FATIGUE PLAQUES HER. SHE WENT FROM A B CUP TO A DEFORMED A CUP. NONE OF THESE PROBLEMS WERE DISCUSSED PRIOR TO SURGERY AND SHE IS TOLD SHE IS FINE. HOSP DOES NOT RECOGNIZE A PROBLEM WITH HER CONDITION. ALSO, AFTER RECEIVING A COPY OF HER MEDICAL REPORT, SHE HAS FOUND OUT SEVERAL DETAILS OF HER COMPLAINTS HAVE NOT BEEN DOCUMENTED.|HEYER-SCHULTE SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS, LOW PROFILE, 350 CC|3509350BC|03/16/1994|B|||*||12046.0|0LP|FTR|1.0||nan|Y|12337|||GOLETA|US|MENTOR CORP.||CA|93117||||True
12391|8696|D|1||IN 7/75, RPTR WENT TO HOSP FOR BREAST AUGMENTATION SURGERY. AFTER RECEIVING A DISSATISFYING MASTOPEXY, SHE UNDERWENT A SECOND OPERATION AT THE SAME HOSP TO HAVE SILICONE IMPLANTS PLACED IN BOTH BREASTS. SOON AFTER THE SECOND OPERATION THE IMPLANTS HARDENED IN BOTH BREASTS AND THE DR BEGAN PERFORMING A SQUEEZING TECHNIQUE TO BREAK UP THE SCAR TISSUE THAT HAD CAUSED THE IMPLANTS TO BECOME ENCAPSULATED. DURING ONE OF THE SQUEEZING EPISODES, THE LEFT BREAST IMPLANT RUPTURED AND A LOCAL OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN THE DR'S OFFICE WAS DONE TO REMOVE THE DAMAGED IMPLANT AND HE REPLACED IT WITH ANOTHER IMPLANT. EVENTUALLY, AFTER THE THIRD OPERATION, THE IMPLANTS HARDENED AGAIN CAUSING HER TREMENDOUS UNHAPPINESS. HAVING THE BREAST HARDEN AND THEN SQUEEZED BY THE DR WAS EXTREMELY DEMEANING AND PAINFUL AND CAUSED HER DISTRESS AND MENTAL ANGUISH. THIS PROBLEM CONTINUED THROUGHOUT THE NEXT THREE YRS, UNTIL ON ONE OFFICE VISIT WHEN HE WAS PERFORMING THE SQUEEZING TECHNIQUE THE LEFT IMPLANT RUPTURED ONCE MORE AND THIS TIME HE REQUESTED THAT RPTR MEET HIM AT HOSP WERE DR, HIS WIFE, AND A RN PERFORMED THE FOURTH OPERATION TO REMOVE THE RUPTURED SILICONE IMPLANT. HE DIDN'T REPLACE IT LEAVING HER WITH THE RIGHT BREAST A 34C AND THE LEFT BREAST A 34B, IN WHICH SHE USES VARIOUS PROSTHESIS TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LACK OF MASS IN THE LEFT BREAST. FOR THE LAST 17 YRS, SHE HAS HAD TO LIVE WITH AN ENCAPSULATED RIGHT IMPLANT SEALED TO THE UPPER CAVITY OF HER CHEST, HATING EVERY MINUTE IT HAS BEEN IN HER BODY. RPTR STATES THE MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL STRESS HAS BEEN HORRENDOUS TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT WHAT IT HAS CAUSED HER IMMUNE SYSTEM. SHE SUFFERS DAILY FROM RESPIRATORY ALLERGIES AND HAS TO USE ANTIHISTAMINES AND NASAL SPRAYS. INITIALLY, SHE WENT IN FOR  WHAT SHE THOUGHT WAS A SIMPLE PROCEDURE THAT WOULD ENHANCE HER SELF-ESTEEM AND THE WHOLE EPISODE RESULTED IN HER LOOKING LIKE A FREAK. RPTR FEELS THESE IMPLANTS CONTRIBUTED TO THE DESTRUCTION OF HER SANITY. ASIDE FROM THE DISCOMFORT AND THE PHYSICAL DEFORMITY, SHE THINKS THE KNOWLEDGE OF HER FEELING INHUMAN STEMMED FROM THIS HARD FOREIGN OBJECT BEING IN HER BODY AND CAUSED THE MOST PROBLEMS.

THE RECEIVED ORIGINAL RIGHT SIDE IMPLANT HAD A SEVERELY DEGRADED SHELL AS WELL AS PERFORATIONS BUT IT WAS NOT GROSLY RUPTURED. THE LEFT IMPLANT HAD PERFORATED INNER AND OUTER SHELLS AND WAS SEVERELY CONTAMINATED BY TISSUE AND POSSIBLY MICRO-ORGANISMS AND THEIR METABOLITES. THE GEL LEAKED PROFUSELY THROUGH MULTIPLE PERFORATIONS. THE GEL WAS ALSO INVASIVE AND OF AN EASILY DISPERSED NATURE. THE CAPSULE RECEIVED IN THE CONTAINER INDICATING THE RIGHT SIDE SHOWS A DISORGANIZED MASS OF TISSUE CONSISTENT WITH SEVERE ADVERSE REACTION AND FAILURE OF THE CAPSULE TO CONTAIN THE DEBRIS OF A GROSSLY LEAKING PROSTHESIS.

BEGINNING IN 1990, SHE ALSO NOTICED UNUSUAL SKIN IRRITATIONS, WHICH SHE NEVER HAD BEFORE. THEN DURING THE FALL OF 1992, SHE ENCOUNTERED DIZZINESS WHICH THEN FOLLOWED INTO EXTREME FATIGUE, GENERAL MALAISE, HIGH PULSE RATE, HEART PALPITATIONS, INSOMNIA, GASTRO-INTESTINAL DISORDERS, FOOD SENSITIVITIES, PAIN IN THE MID-BACK UP INTO THE NECK (RIGHT SIDE MAINLY), DISCOMFORT IN THE UPPER CHEST AND THROAT AREA, CONSTANT HUNGER PAINS WITH WEIGHT LOSS, SOME CONCENTRATION AND MEMORY DIFFICULTIES, AND A SEVERE CASE OF RAYNAUD'S. RPTR WAS PUT THROUGH A SERIES OF LAB TESTS, X-RAYS, ULTRASOUNDS, ETC. THE RESULTS OF ALL OF THESE TESTS WERE MAINLY NEGATIVE. HOWEVER, A FIBROID TUMOR WAS THOUGHT TO BE THE PROBLEM. AS RPTR WAS ALSO GOING THROUGH MENOPAUSE, THE DRS AND RPTR THOUGHT THE PROBLEMS WERE RELATED TO HORMONAL CHANGES. IN 1993, RPTR HAD UNDERGONE A HYSTERECTOMY AND GALL BLADDER REMOVAL. SHE NEVER FELT ANY BETTER. THEN IN EARLY 3/94, AFTER HER HUSBAND AND DR ENCOURAGED HER TO KEEP TRACK OF HER ACTIVITIES, SHE DISCOVERED THAT SEX WOULD SET OFF AN ATTACK. LIKEWISE, WEATHER CHANGES, ANY KIND OF STRESS (BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE), EXERCISE, GARDENING, VIGOROUS WALKING, ETC, CERTAIN FOODS, AND EVEN A MASSAGE APPEARED TO EXACERBATE THE SYMPTOMS. ACTING ON THIS DISCOVERY, SHE CONSULTED AN ENDOCRINOLOGIST WHO SPECIALIZES IN AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS AND 2 GYNECOLOGISTS ALL OF WHOM RECOMMENDED THAT RPTR SEES A PLASTIC SURGEON WHO IN TURN ORDERED AN ULTRASOUND OF THE BREASTS.

OUTPATIENT OPERATIVE REPORT, 4-19-93 - POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: MECHANICAL COMPLICATIONS OF SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. MASTODYNIA. RUPTURED SILICONE IMPLANTS, BILATERAL. SKIN LESIONS OF RIGHT FACE AND FOREHEAD. PROCEDURE: THE PT WAS PLACED IN SUPINE POSITION. AFTER ACHIEVING SATISFACTORY GENERAL ANESTHESIA HER CHEST WAS PREPPED AND DRAPED IN THE USUAL FASHION. SKIN MARKINGS WERE PREVIOUSLY MADE WITH THE PT IN A SITTING POSITION. THE INCISION WAS INFILTRATED WITH LIDOCAINE 0.5% WITH EPINEPHRINE. A 5-CM DIAMETER AREOLAR CIRCLE WAS MADE AND THE KEYHOLE SKIN INCISION MADE. THE INTERVENING SKIN WAS THEN DEEPITHELIALIZED TOTALLY. A LATERALLY BASED PARENCHYMAL FLAP WAS CREATED AND THE INCISION WAS CARRIED DIRECTLY THROUGH THE PARENCHYMA DOWN TO THE IMPLANT CAPSULE. UNDER DIRECT VISION, THE IMPLANT CAPSULE WAS DISSECTED FREE FROM SURROUNDING BREAST PARENCHYMA. ON THE RIGHT SIDE, IT WAS REMOVED ""EN TOTO"" AND THERE WERE SEVERAL IRREGULAR PROJECTIONS OF THE CAPSULE. THE CAPSULE WAS INADVERTENTLY ENTERED 2 OR 3 TIMES SUPERFICIALLY. INSTANTLY, STICKY GEL LEAKAGE WAS NOTED EACH TIME AND NO DISCRETE CAPSULAR MATERIAL LAYER WAS SEEN. PROLENE SUTURES WERE USED TO TEMPORARILY CLOSE THE CAPSULE TO AVOID EXTENSIVE LEAKAGE AND TO ALLOW CONTINUATION OF THE IMPLANT REMOVAL. AFTER TOTAL REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT AND CAPSULE, THE BREAST WAS PALPATED FOR ANY MASSES SUSPICIOUS FOR EITHER NEOPLASM OR RETAINED SILICONE GRANULOMA. NONE WAS FOUND. THE WOUND WAS IRRIGATED WITH SALINE. THE LATERALLY BASED PARENCHYMAL FLAP WAS SHIFTED TOWARD THE CENTER AND PLACED UNDERNEATH THE NIPPLE PROJECTION WITH ONE SINGLE #2-0 VICRYL SUTURE. LATER AFTER THE PT WAS PUT IN A SEMISITTING POSITION, ADDITIONAL #2-0 VICRYL SUTURES WERE PLACED ALONG THE INFRAMAMMARY CREASE MEDIALLY AND LATERALLY TO REDEFINE THE INFRAMAMMARY CREASE AS WELL AS ADDING TO THE PROJECTION OF THE NIPPLE. A SIMILAR PROCEDURE WAS PERFORMED ON THE LEFT BREAST AND THE ENTIRE CAPSULE WAS REMOVED. SIMILARLY, WITH A SMALL PUNCTURE OF THE CAPSULE, IT WAS NOTED THAT THERE WAS IMMEDIATE OOZING OF STICKY GEL MATERIAL FROM THE CAPSULE. SIMILAR PALPATION AND IRRIGATION WAS PERFORMED ON THE LEFT SIDE. THE LATERALLY BASED PARENCHYMAL FLAP WAS SUTURED UNDERNEATH THE NIPPLE FOR PROJECTION. SKIN STAPLES WERE USED FOR TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF THE SKIN. THE PT WAS THEN PUT INTO A SEMISITTING POSITION AND THE LOCATION OF THE NIPPLE, THE BREAST SHAPE AND THE INFRAMAMMARY INCISIONS WERE ADJUSTED BY REAPPLYING THE SKIN STAPLES. SKIN MARKINGS WERE THEN MADE AND THE CLOSURE WAS COMPLETED WITH #3-0 VICRYL INTERRUPTED SUTURES FOLLOWED BY #4-0 MAXON SUBCUTICULAR SUTURES. TWO JACKSON-PRATT DRAINS WERE PLACED UNDERNEATH THE BREASTS PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF CLOSURE. LATER THE IMPLANTS WERE OPENED ON THE TABLE. IT WAS NOTED THAT ON THE RIGHT SIDE, THERE WAS TOTAL DISRUPTION OF THE IMPLANT AND THAT NO VISIBLE SHELL WAS SEEN. ON THE LEFT SIDE, THERE WAS ALSO SEVERAL GROSS RUPTURES OF THE IMPLANT AWAY FROM THE AREA OF THE INITIAL INCISION THROUGH THE CAPSULE. IT WAS THEREFORE QUITE OBVIOUS THAT THE IMPLANT HAD BEEN RUPTURED ON BOTH SIDES FOR QUITE SOME TIME. THE IMPLANTS WERE BOTH MEASURED IN VOLUME BY IMMERSION IN SALINE AND EACH WAS FOUND TO BE 300 CC. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS IS INCLUDING THE SCAR CAPSULE AROUND THE IMPLANT. A SMALL SKIN GROWTH AROUND THE RIGHT ALAR BASE AND IN THE MIDFOREHEAD WERE SHARPLY EXCISED.

THEN THE SECOND TIME WAS TO CORRECT THE CAPSULE AND SIZE DIFFERENCE. CAPSULED AFTER THEY WERE REPLACED AGAIN WHICH THE DR APPARENTLY CORRECTED WITH MASSAGES. HOWEVER, IT HAS BEEN OVER A YEAR SINCE THE LAST SET WERE REPLACED AND PT JUST DOESN'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN ANYMORE FOR ADVICE. THE DRS - COSMETIC - PT BELIEVES MOSTLY WANT TO MAKE THE MONEY AND KEEPS GETTING THE WRONG ADVICE. SINCE PT HAS BEEN UNEMPLOYED PT HAS BEEN UNABLE TO AFFORD MEDICAL INSURANCE THEREFORE PT DOESN'T KNOW IF THE PRODUCT IS TO BLAME FOR THE PAIN THEY FEEL THROUGHOUT BODY EVERYDAY. PT HAS SEEN ON TV MANY WOMEN BOTH YOUNG AND OLD WHO HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING ALL THE SYMPTOMS PT IS NOW FEELING, SO PT HAS GROWN GREAT CONCERNS. PT HAS ALSO GONE ONTO MANY FORUMS WHICH WOMEN TALK ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS AS WELL. THEY SAY THEY HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE AND RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT THIS DEBILITATION IS A ""HIDDEN"" SIDE EFFECT TO THE SALINE IMPLANTS THAT NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT. PT IS GOING TO VISIT A DR IN THE NEXT 2 WEEKS WHICH THEY BELIEVE WILL RUN SOME KIND OF TOXIC REPORT TO SEE IF THE IMPLANTS ARE TO BLAME FOR THIS. PT WAS ALREADY DIAGNOSED AS HAVING ARTHRITIS WITHIN ONE YEAR OF FIRST SET OF IMPLANTS. PT HAS TROUBLE HOLDING THE PHONE TO EAR FOR MORE THAN 5 MINUTES WITH HAVING FINGERS CRIPPLE UP. PT'S LEGS HURT ALL THE TIME. PT GETTING EXTREMELY DEPRESSED ABOUT THE PAIN THEY SUFFER EVERYDAY. PT HAS TROUBLE GETTING OUT OF BED. THESE ARE ALL THE SYMPTOMS ALL THE OTHER WOMEN SEEM TO BE COMPLAINING ABOUT AND LIKE PT SAID PT WAS ENERGETIC WHO USED TO WORK OUT AT THE GYM FOR UP TO 2 HOURS A DAY WITH NO PROBLEM AND NOW PT CAN'T EVEN VACUUM FLOORS WITHOUT HURTING. PT HAS HAD TO HIRE SOMEONE TO CLEAN THEIR HOUSE. THEIR CHILDREN ARE NO LONGER INVOLVED IN AFTER SCHOOL SPORTS BECAUSE PT GETS FRUSTRATED WITH WALKING BACK AND FORTH.

HE TOLD PT THAT THE SALINES WERE COMPLETELY SAFE AND IN THE ""VERY RARE"" CHANCE THAT THE IMPLANTS WOULD LEAK OR BREAK THAT THE SALT WATER WOULD BE HARMLESSLY ABSORBED INTO BODY. IN 2/1996 PT WENT FOR THEIR FIRST CONSULTATION WITH THE PLASTIC SURGEON. THE ONLY OTHER COMPLICATIONS THAT HE DISCUSSED WITH PT WERE THE NORMAL RISKS WITH SURGERY, INFECTION AND ANESTHESIA PROBLEMS. WHEN PT GOT THE PAPERWORK TO SIGN WITH NUMEROUS OTHER WARNINGS ON IT PT ASKED QUESTIONS AND WAS ASSURED THAT THOSE WERE ONLY BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE SILICONE -- NOT SALINE. THE OPERATION WAS SCHEDUELD. NINE MONTHS LATER HE SCHEDULED PT FOR ANOTHER OPERATION AS PT HAD DEVELOPED CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. THEY BOTH HAD TO BE REMOVED AND REINSERTED. WITH IN A FEW HOURS ONE OF PT'S IMPLANTS HAD COMPLETELY DEFLATED. PT WAS VERY SCARED AND CALLED THEIR PLASTIC SURGEON'S EMERGENCY SERVICE. PT WAS BACK IN FOR SURGERY TO HAVE THE IMPLANT REPLACED. APPARENTLY THE VALVE HAD FAILED AND LEAKED. HE SAID THAT THIS WAS VERY RARE. SHORTLY AFTER THIS PT STARTED HAVING A LOT OF HEADACHES. PT WAS TREATED FOR MIGRAINES AND ALLERGIES. THEN PT STARTED GETTING SEVERE CRAMPING AND MUSCLE SPASMS IN NECK AND SHOULDERS AND HAD TO BE PUT ON MUSCLE RELAXERS. HEALTH GOT WORSE AND WORSE AND PT WAS VERY MUCH IN PAIN MOST OF THE TIME AND EXTREMELY STRESSED OUT. PT SAW NUMEROUS DRS AND WAS TREATED WITH ANTI-DEPRESSANTS AS THEY FELT THE ANXIETY WAS CAUSED BY THE CHRONIC PAIN. EVERY FLU OR VIRUS THAT COMES ALONG, PT GETS IT. THE HEADACHES WERE GETTING WORSE AND PT STARTED SEEING NEUROLOGISTS AND CHIROPRACTORS AND MASSAGE THERAPISTS, AND FINALLY A PAIN MANAGEMENT DR AS A LAST RESORT. THANKFULLY, PT DID MENTION IMPLANTS. HE THEN ASKED IF PT HAD EVER HAD A LEAK. PT STARTED RESEARCHING AND BECAME EXTREMELY TERRIFIED AFTER FINDING SEVERAL DIFFERENT WEB SITES WITH OTHER WOMEN'S BREAST IMPLANT HORROR STORIES. AFTER DOING A LOT OF SOUL SEARCHING AND RESEARCH PT DECIDED TO HAVE THEM REMOVED. PT WENT BACK TO IMPLANTING PLASTIC SURGEON TO ASK HIM TO DO IT. PT MENTIONED ALL OF THE INFO FOUND OUT AND TOLD HIM. THEY DID NOT WANT TO RISK HEALTH ANYMORE. HIS ATTITUDE COMPLETELY CHANGED AT THIS POINT. HE SAID THAT PT NEEDED TO WAIT ANOTHER 6 MONTHS AS HE WAS SURE THAT PT WOULD CHANGE THEIR MIND. PT SAID THAT THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF THEM CHANGING THEIR MIND BUT HE WOULDN'T LISTEN. PT TOLD HIM THAT THEY WERE SCARED AND WOULD GLADLY PAY FOR THE OPERATION. PT WASN'T ASKING FOR A FREEBIE. HE TREATED PT HORRIBLY SAYING THAT PT NEEDED TO BE TESTED FOR CANCER AND OTHER DISEASES AS ILLNESSES WERE PROBABLY FROM ONE OF THOSE AND HE COULDN'T OPERATE IF PT HAD CANCER. PT ASSURED HIM SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE CONVERSATION THAT THEY WOULD HAVE ALL OF THE TESTS PERFORMED THAT HE FELT NECESSARY TO RULE THOSE OUT FIRST. AT THIS POINT IN HIS OFFICE PT STARTED CRYING AND BEGGING HIM TO PLEASE PUT THEM ON HIS SCHEDULE AS HE IS PRETTY BOOKED ALL OF THE TIME AND IN THE MEANTIME PT WOULD HAVE ALL OF THE TESTING DONE HE NEEDED. HE WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM WHILE PT WAS TALKING TO HIM. PT HAD ANOTHER APPOINTMENT WITH A DIFFERENT DR. UPON SEEING HIM HE AGREED TO REMOVE THEM BASED ON PT'S FINDINGS AND SCHEDULED OPERATION.

AT NO TIME DID I MAKE A LINK TO MY BREAST IMPLANTS AS I THOUGHT I WAS SUFFERING SYMPTOMS OF STRESS. HOWEVER, DUE TO RECENTLY ACCELERATED MUSCLE LOSS AND SKIN PROBLEMS, ALONG WITH INCREASED PAIN IN MY CHEST AND NECK, I TRIED TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS TO SEE MY PRIVATE SURGEON AT (B)(6) WHICH TOOK ME THREE MONTHS TO SECURE. I HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT AT LEAST ONE OF MY INAMED SILICONE IMPLANTS HAD RUPTURED (NOW VERY SMALL AND DEFORMED) AND THAT THE GEL HAS INFLAMED MY LYMPH NODES. I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME CONNECTION BETWEEN MY SYMPTOMS WHICH HAVE PERSISTED AND GRADUALLY WORSENED FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS NOW - EXCEPT FOR RECENT HEIGHTENED CHEST PAINS WHICH PROMPTED ME TO CONTACT MY SURGERY PROVIDER. I NOW HAVE THE ADDED STRESS OF KNOWING THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG, AND THAT THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT DAMAGE MAY BE BEING DONE TO MY BODY, SO PERHAPS SOME MEDICAL MONITORING WOULD KEEP US ALL INFORMED? AS IT STANDS, MY CURRENT SITUATION IS THAT THE (B)(6) WON'T REMOVE THE RUPTURED IMPLANT BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT LIABILITY LIES WITH THE PRIVATE PRACTICE WHO UNDERTOOK THE SURGERY. (B)(6), FROM WHOM I PURCHASED MY IMPLANTS, CANNOT HELP ME WITHOUT PAYMENT UP FRONT. AS I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO WORK FOR SOME TIME, I CANNOT AFFORD PRIVATE SURGERY COSTS. SO, FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, THE RUPTURED IMPLANT WILL HAVE TO STAY IN MY BODY. I WONDER IF THE FDA WOULD BE INTERESTED IN COLLECTING DATA FROM MY CURRENT HEALTH SITUATION FOR FUTURE REFERENCE IN REGARD TO ANY FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS OVER THE SAFETY OF SILICONE IMPLANTS. AS MY HEALTH SEEMS TO BE DETERIORATING FAST, AND THE IMPLANT REMAINS IN PLACE, PERHAPS MY BODY CAN PROVIDE THE PROOF TO LINK OR DISMISS THE DESTRUCTIVE EFFECTS OF SILICONE IMPLANTS IN HUMANS.

3199749|10822419|N|1||MEDWATCH SUBMITTED: 05/20/2013. ALLERGAN LABELING ADDRESSES THE EVENT OF BREAST LUMPS AS FOLLOWS: BREAST SELF-EXAMINATIONS: FOLLOWING BREAST AUGMENTATION, YOU SHOULD CONTINUE TO PERFORM BREAST SELF-EXAMINATION MONTHLY. THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH A BREAST IMPLANT IN PLACE. TO CONTINUE TO PERFORM A MONTHLY BREAST SELF EXAMINATION EFFICIENTLY, YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU IDENTIFY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLANT AND YOUR BREAST TISSUE. BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE IMPLANT FROM BREAST TISSUE WILL DECREASE THE NECESSITY OF EXCESSIVE SQUEEZING OF THE IMPLANT DURING EXAMINATION. ANY NEW LUMPS SHOULD BE EVALUATED WITH A BIOPSY, AS APPROPRIATE. IF A BIOPSY IS PERFORMED, BE SURE TO INFORM THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL PERFORMING THE BIOPSY THAT YOU HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS SO THAT CARE WILL BE TAKEN TO AVOID INJURING THE IMPLANT. THE 410 DEVICE LABELING ADDRESSES ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL): BASED ON INFO REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGAN'S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERS' BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. FOR MORE COMPLETE AND UP-TO-DATE INFO ON FDA'S ANALYSIS AND REVIEW OF THE ALCL IN PTS WITH BREAST IMPLANTS PLEASE VISIT: HTTP://WWW.FDA.GOV/MEDICALDEVICES/PRODUCTSANDMEDICALPROCEDURES/IMPLANTSANDPROSTHETICS/BREASTIMPLANTS/UCM239995.HTM.|STYLE 115 SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|115-378|05/20/2013|||DA|N|R||0HP|FTR|1.0|04/24/2011|nan||1267625|||LA AURORA DE HEREDIA|CS|ALLERGAN|||||||True
3161630|3489191|D|1||I HAD SILICONE IMPLANTS PLACED UNDER MY BREAST MUSCLE IN (B)(6) 2004. I HAD BREAST FED BOTH OF MY CHILDREN AND WANTED TO REPLACE THE VOLUME LOST AFTERWARDS. I MET WITH A PLASTIC SURGEON ABOUT MY OPTIONS AND HE SUGGESTED SILICONE IMPLANTS DUE TO THEIR SOFTNESS AND ABILITY TO FEEL MORE NATURAL THAN A SALINE IMPLANT. IN (B)(6) 2012 I BEGAN TO HAVE MEDICAL PROBLEMS. IT STARTED WITH THORACIC BACK PAIN THAT WAS INTENSE AND SEVERE. IT THEN RADIATED TO MY NECK, SHOULDERS AND CHEST AREA. I HAD NUMEROUS TESTS RUN ON ME AND NOTHING PROVED TO BE THE CAUSE FOR THE PAIN I WAS FEELING. I HAD MRIS, X-RAYS, BLOOD WORK, HAD EXTENSIVE PHYSICAL THERAPY, DEEP TISSUE MASSAGE AND ACUPRESSURE FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS. I HAD INJECTIONS AND VARIOUS MEDICATIONS GIVEN TO ME TO TRY AND HELP WITH THE PAIN. IT DID NOT HELP AND I CONTINUED TO WORE. I FELT LIKE SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH MY IMPLANTS AND PERHAPS THIS WAS THE CAUSE SINCE THIS CAME ON FROM NOWHERE AND HAD ALWAYS BEEN HEALTHY AND QUITE ACTIVE. THE SURGEON WHO PLACED THEM INSIDE ME BARELY EXAMINED ME AND TOLD ME IN (B)(6) 2012 THAT IT WAS NOT FROM MY IMPLANTS AND TO SEARCH ELSEWHERE. HE DID NOT REQUEST AN MRI OF MY IMPLANTS OR ANY ADDITIONAL TESTING. AT THIS POINT I AM BECOMING MORE AND MORE FATIGUED, I AM FEELING HARDNESS IN MY LYMPH NODES IN MY BREAST AREA, AND NECK AREA. I CAN BARELY MOVE AND HAVE NO ENERGY. I AM NO MISSING A LOT OF WORK DUE TO MY SUDDEN AND PROBLEMATIC HEALTH ISSUES. I CONTINUED TO SEARCH FOR THE CAUSE. I WENT TO (B)(6) BASED ON THIS DOCTOR TELLING ME TO LOOK ELSEWHERE. AFTER A YEAR OF THIS CONTINUED PAIN AND SWELLING AND NUMEROUS DOCTOR BILLS I WENT TO ANOTHER PLASTIC SURGEON FOR HIS OPINION. HE IMMEDIATELY TOLD ME THAT MY BREASTS WERE TOO LARGE AND THAT THEY DIDN'T LOOK RIGHT. HE SAID I SHOULD HAVE THEM REMOVED TO HELP ME IMPROVE MY HEALTH. I HAD THESE IMPLANTS REMOVED ON (B)(6) 2013 AND AFTERWARDS THE SURGEON TOLD ME THAT THE IMPLANTS HAD COMPLETELY RUPTURED AND THAT THE IMPLANTS HAD LEAKED THE SILICONE EVERYWHERE. HE SAID IT WAS ONE OF THE WORSE CASES HE HAD SEEN. MY RECOVERY HAS BEEN HORRIBLE. MY LYMPH NODES ARE TOTALLY SWOLLEN AND IT IS OBVIOUS AND VERY VISIBLE. MY BACK PAIN FROM THE TRAUMA OF THE REMOVAL OF THE LEAKED SILICONE HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE. I HAVE HAD A MAJOR WEIGHT GAIN WHICH APPEARS TO BE FROM FLUID RETENTION AND MY LYMPHATIC SYSTEM APPEARS TO NOT BE WORKING PROPERLY. I NOW HAVE TO MEET WITH AN AUTOIMMUNE SPECIALIST TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING ON SINCE NO OTHER DIAGNOSIS HAS BEEN DETERMINED. I HAVE NOW LOST MY JOB DUE TO MY FAILING HEALTH AND TRULY FEEL IT IS BECAUSE OF THE RUPTURED SILICONE THAT HAD BEEN LEAKED INTO MY BODY EVERYWHERE. I HAD BEEN DISMISSED BY THE ORIGINAL SURGEON WHEN CLEARLY HE SHOULD HAVE REQUESTED AN MRI WHICH WOULD HAVE SHOWN THE RUPTURED IMPLANTS. INSTEAD I WENT ANOTHER YEAR IN MAJOR PAIN WHEN MY IMPLANTS HAD LEAKED. MY NORMAL PHYSICIAN ALSO BELIEVES THERE IS AN AUTOIMMUNE ISSUE GOING ON WITH ME DUE TO THE IMPLANTS. MY LIFE HAS BEEN DRASTICALLY AFFECTED IN MANY WAYS. IT HAS DESTROYED MY HEALTH, CAREER, PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS AND HAS FINANCIALLY DEVASTATED ME. I AM DISGUSTED THAT THE ORIGINAL SURGEON DID NOT STEP UP TO HELP DIAGNOSE THE POSSIBILITY THAT MY IMPLANTS HAD RUPTURED AND WAS CAUSING ME TO BE SICK. AT THE VERY LEAST HE SHOULD HAVE REQUESTED OR SUGGESTED THAT IN (B)(6) 2012. MY BREASTS LOOKED DEFORMED AND WERE TOO BIG AND THIS WAS VERIFIED BY MY OTHER SURGEON. I AM WANTING THIS TO BE DOCUMENTED TO TRY AND HELP OTHERS. (B)(6) NEVER RETURNED ANY OF MY EMAILS OR CALLS IN REGARDS TO THIS. THEY ONLY KEPT IN CONTACT WITH ME FOR THEIR STUDY THE FIRST YEAR AFTER HAVING THEIR IMPLANTS PLACED IN ME.

3788317|4434473|D|1||SUBJECT: RESEARCH STUDY FOR BREAST IMPLANT RUPTURE COMPLICATIONS MESSAGE: TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT I HAVE RUPTURED SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS. THESE WERE DUPONT SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS THAT WERE INSERTED IN (B)(6) 1976. I KNOW THEY HAVE BEEN RUPTURED FOR A LONG TIME. ONE BREAST FEELS LIKE A MASS OF JELLY. THE OTHER BREAST IS HARD AND HAS THE CAPSULAR CONTRACTION. THE GEL IS OOZING OUT AND CALCIFYING ON THE OUTSIDE. I WILL BE (B)(6) OF THIS YEAR (2014). THE IMPLANTS HAVE BEEN IN FOR ALMOST 40 YEARS. I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MEDICARE COVERS THE EXPLANT AND REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT MATERIAL BUT DOES NOT COVER THE EXCHANGE OF IMPLANTS. I WAS QUOTED BY A DOCTOR (B)(6) FOR REMOVAL OF BOTH IMPLANTS AND EXCHANGE WITH NEW ONES. WHEN THEY WERE ADVISED THAT MEDICARE PAID ONLY FOR THE REMOVAL THEY THEN QUOTED ME A PRICE OF (B)(6) TO INSERT THE IMPLANT AT THE SAME TIME. I WOULD HAVE TO PAY THE (B)(6). I FAIL TO SEE THE LOGIC OF THE PRICING. HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT MY MAJOR CONCERN. DUE TO THE AGE AND MY BELIEF THAT THE RUPTURE OCCURRED YEARS AGO, I WONDER HOW MUCH OF THIS GEL HAS TRAVELED THROUGH MY BODY. THE PLASTIC SURGEON TOLD ME THAT THE SILICONE MATERIAL IN THIS PARTICULAR IMPLANT WAS VERY THIN AND JUST RAN OUT LIKE WATER. I HAVE BEEN READING ABOUT ACL AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT SILICONE LEAKAGE CAN CAUSE THIS DISEASE. IF IT DOES, I WOULD BE THE LIKELY CANDIDATE TO SEE IF THE GEL HAS TRAVELED TO THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. THIS IS MY BIGGEST CONCERN. I WAS JUST A LITTLE PUZZLED THAT THE PRICING FOR INSERTION OF NEW BREAST PROSTHESES WAS ONLY (B)(6) LESS THAN THE PROCEDURE FOR CLEANING OUT THE RUPTURED IMPLANT AND PUTTING A NEW ONE IN ITS PLACE. COULD YOU PLEASE ADVISE ME IF THERE ARE CURRENTLY ANY STUDIES GOING ON THAT PERTAIN TO MY PARTICULAR SITUATION AS I WOULD DESIRE TO BE A PARTICIPANT IN THAT STUDY. I HAVE A LETTER FROM THE RETIRED THORACIC SURGEON, DR (B)(6), WHO INSERTED THE IMPLANTS STATING THERE WAS A DEGREE OF HYPERPLASIA. MY CURRENT DOCTOR, DR (B)(6), THAT HE WAS CONCERNED THERE WOULD BE SOME DISFIGUREMENT FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANTS BECAUSE OF TISSUE REMOVAL AND PERHAPS THE NECESSITY TO REMOVE MORE AND ALSO THE FACT THAT THE TISSUE COVERING THE IMPLANT HAS BEEN EXPANDED FOR SUCH A PERIOD OF TIME.

A LARGE, LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP FOUND NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE RISK RATES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CANCERS, INCLUDING STOMACH CANCER, LEUKEMIA, AND LYMPHOMA. IN THE (B)(4) STUDY, AT LEAST 1 REOPERATION WAS PERFORMED ON 315 PTS (36.5%) THROUGH 10 YEARS. A TOTAL OF 424 REOPERATIONS WERE PERFORMED. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR REOPERATION THROUGH 10 YEARS ON AUGMENTATION PATIENTS WAS IMPLANT DEFLATION AT 21.7%. THE PERCENTAGE OF REOPERATIONS DUE TO LUMP/MASS/CYST INCREASED FROM 8.5% OF 293 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 5 YEARS TO 13.9% OF 424 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 10 YEARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF LUMPS, MASSES, AND CYSTS CAN BE EXPECTED TO NATURALLY INCREASE AS PTS AGE AND COULD BE AN EXPLANATION FOR THE INCREASE. IN RARE INSTANCES, ACUTE INFECTION MAY OCCUR IN A BREAST WITH IMPLANTS. THE SIGNS OF ACUTE INFECTION INCLUDE ERYTHEMA, TENDERNESS, FLUID ACCUMULATION, PAIN, AND FEVER. VERY RARELY, TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME, A POTENTIALLY LIFE-THREATENING CONDITION, HAS BEEN REPORTED IN WOMEN AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY. IT IS CHARACTERIZED BY SYMPTOMS THAT OCCUR SUDDENLY AND INCLUDE HIGH FEVER (102 DEGREE F, 38.8 DEGREE C OR HIGHER), VOMITING, DIARRHEA, A SUNBURN-LIKE RASH, RED EYES, DIZZINESS, LIGHTHEADEDNESS, MUSCLE ACHES, AND DROPS IN BLOOD PRESSURE, WHICH MAY CAUSE FAINTING. PTS SHOULD BE ADVISED TO CONTACT A PHYSICIAN IMMEDIATELY FOR DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT FOR ANY OF THESE SYSTEMS. POTENTIALS ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, SYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY.

BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. IN THE PASS STUDY, AT LEAST 1 REOPERATION WAS PERFORMED ON 315 PATIENTS (36.5%) THROUGH 10 YEARS. A TOTAL OF 424 REOPERATIONS WERE PERFORMED. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR REOPERATION THROUGH 10 YEARS ON AUGMENTATION PATIENTS WAS IMPLANT DEFLATION AT 21.7%. THE PERCENTAGE OF REOPERATIONS DUE TO LUMP/MASS/CYST INCREASED FROM 8.5% OF 293 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 5 YEARS TO 13.9% OF 424 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 10 YEARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF LUMPS, MASSES, AND CYSTS CAN BE EXPECTED TO NATURALLY INCREASE AS PATIENTS AGE AND COULD BE AN EXPLANATION FOR THE INCREASE. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, ASYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. OF THE 237 PATIENTS IN THE R95 STUDY, AT LEAST 1 REOPERATION WAS PERFORMED ON 99 PATIENTS (42%) FOR A TOTAL OF 125 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 5 YEARS. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR REOPERATION THROUGH 5 YEARS WAS CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE AT 25.6%. OF THE 237 RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS IN R95, THERE WERE 62 PATIENTS (26.2%) WHO HAD 70 IMPLANTS REMOVED THROUGH 5 YEARS. OF THE 70 RECONSTRUCTION IMPLANTS REMOVED THROUGH 5 YEARS, 70% WERE REPLACED. THE MOST COMMON REASON FOR IMPLANT REMOVAL WAS CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE (31.4%). THROUGH 10 YEARS, THERE WERE 104 IMPLANTS REMOVED FROM 85 PATIENTS.

5161651|28832951|D|1||I EXPERIENCED SEVERE ILL HEALTH FOLLOWING BREAST SUB-MUSCULAR IMPLANTATION WITH ALLERGAN MCGHAN SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANTS (300G IN EACH BREAST) IN (B)(6) 2014. RECOVERY FROM THE OPERATION WAS NORMAL AND THE SCARS LOCATED IN THE SUB-MAMMARY FOLD HEALED WELL. HOWEVER, EVEN FROM THE EARLY STAGES I FELT A STRANGE SENSE OF DISSOCIATION FROM MY BODY AND SOCIALLY. I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE IMPLANTS AT THE TIME BUT I FOUND THAT I WAS ALWAYS ON EDGE, IRRITABLE AND ANXIOUS. PHYSICALLY THE IMPLANTS FELT FINE BUT I FOUND THAT THEY DID APPEAR SMALLER AT ABOUT THE 18 MONTH MARK (POSSIBLY DUE TO EARLY STAGE CAPSULATION). THE MAIN PROBLEM OCCURRED AT AROUND 23 MONTHS FOLLOWING SURGERY. ONE MONDAY MORNING IN (B)(6) 2014 I FELT A BIT UNDER THE WEATHER BUT MY PERIOD WAS DUE AND FEELING SLIGHTLY OFF PAR AROUND MENSTRUATION IS SOMETHING I OFTEN EXPERIENCE. HOWEVER, BY THE EVENING A TERRIBLE PAIN ENGULFED BOTH MY BREASTS. IT WAS SIMILAR TO THE USUAL BENIGN, HORMONAL BREAST PAIN WOMEN EXPERIENCE BUT FELT MORE PERMANENT, AS IF IT WOULD TAKE MORE THAN THE STANDARD IBUPROFEN TO SORT THIS ONE OUT. AT THE SAME TIME AS THE BREAST PAIN, I WAS EXPERIENCING A WEIRD PAIN IN MY RIGHT EYE AREA, LIKE THAT YOU HAVE WHEN SUFFERING SINUSITIS. I WENT TO REST IN MY BED WITH A HOT WATER BOTTLE ON MY CHEST AND THAT DID MANAGE TO SOOTHE THE PAIN SLIGHTLY AND I FELT WELL ENOUGH TO GET OUT OF BED EVEN THOUGH THE PAIN WAS STILL THERE ALBEIT A LOT MORE TOLERABLE. I WENT TO BED AT THE END OF THE DAY AS NORMAL BUT WHEN I WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING I WOKE UP TO THE IRRITATING PAIN AGAIN. IT WAS VIRTUALLY GONE FROM THE LEFT BREAST BUT REMAINED IN THE RIGHT ONE. THE STRANGE EYE PAIN WAS STILL PRESENT TOO AND IF IT WASN'T FOR THIS INFLAMMATORY SENSATION, THE BREAST PAIN ALONE WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT MORE MANAGEABLE. THE SCARIEST THING OF ALL IS THAT THE PAIN NEVER QUITE FELT BIOLOGICAL IN NATURE; IT WAS A WEIRD, FOREIGN, PERSISTENT SENSATION THAT WOULD STAY WITH ME (WITHOUT ANY CHANGE IN PAIN LEVELS) FOR THE NEXT 6 WEEKS. I TRIED THE STANDARD METHODS IN AN ATTEMPT TO ALLEVIATE THE PAIN: PAINKILLERS, MASSAGE, HEAT CREAM, NONE OF WHICH WORKED. THE PAIN DROVE ME MAD AND I STRUGGLED TO CONCENTRATE AT WORK AND IN SOCIAL SETTINGS, ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT WAS THE PAIN WHICH I WAS CONVINCED WOULD NEVER GO AWAY. I MADE AN APPOINTMENT TO SEE MY GP AFTER THE FIRST WEEK OF PAIN AND HE HAD PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE WITH RECONSTRUCTIVE BREAST SURGERY AND DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THE PAIN WAS DUE TO THE IMPLANTS. INTERESTINGLY, I WAS PRESCRIBED MEDICATION FOR HEARTBURN AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ALSO OCCURRING AT THE SAME TIME BUT AS THE HEARTBURN DISAPPEARED THE BREAST PAIN REMAINED. IN (B)(6) THIS YEAR, AFTER BEING IN CHRONIC PAIN AND EXPERIENCING BIZARRE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL INCIDENTS FOR 15 MONTHS, I EVENTUALLY MADE A DIFFICULT BUT FIRM DECISION, THE IMPLANTS HAD TO GO.

MY SURGEON LATER EXPLAINED TO ME THAT THERE WAS SOME DISCOLORATION OF THE BREAST IMPLANTS BUT HE HAD SEEN WORSE. I AM NOW 4 MONTHS OUT FROM THE EXPLANTATION SURGERY AND I TRULY FEEL LIKE I'VE HAD MY LIFE BACK. I'M NO LONGER HURTING, ON EDGE, OR HAVE A CONSTANT SENSE OF FOREBODING OR FEAR.

USE CARE IN SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURES SUCH AS OPEN CAPSULOTOMY, BREAST POCKET REVISION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA ASPIRATION, AND BIOPSY/LUMPECTOMY TO AVOID DAMAGE TO THE IMPLANT SHELL OR VALVE. ANY POSTOPERATIVE EVACUATION OF HEMATOMA OR SEROMA MUST BE CONDUCTED WITH CARE TO AVOID BREAST IMPLANT CONTAMINATION, OR DAMAGE FROM SHARP INSTRUMENTS. THE USE OF MICROWAVE DIATHERMY IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST IMPLANTS IS NOT RECOMMENDED, AS IT HAS BEEN REPORTED TO CAUSE TISSUE NECROSIS, SKIN EROSION, AND EXTRUSION OF THE IMPLANT. ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE IN VIVO EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. PATIENTS SHOULD BE INFORMED THAT DISSATISFACTION WITH COSMETIC RESULTS RELATED TO SUCH THINGS AS SCAR DEFORMITY, HYPERTROPHIC SCARRING, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, INCORRECT SIZE, AND IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY MAY OCCUR. CAREFUL SURGICAL PLANNING AND TECHNIQUE CAN MINIMIZE, BUT NOT PRECLUDE, THE RISK OF SUCH RESULTS. PRE-EXISTING ASYMMETRY MAY NOT BE ENTIRELY CORRECTABLE. REVISION SURGERY MAY BE INDICATED TO MAINTAIN PATIENT SATISFACTION BUT CARRIES ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS AND RISKS.

A MICROSCOPIC ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED WHICH IDENTIFY: ONE OPENING STRIATED CURVED ASSESSED AS SURGICAL DAMAGE AND PARTIAL DELAMINATION OF PLUG STRAP DISK SHELL DUE TO ADHESIVE FAILURE. FILL INSPECTION WAS PERFORMED AND IDENTIFIED NO BLOCKAGE IN THE VALVE. BASED ON THE DEVICE ANALYSIS THE FINAL ASSESSMENT IS: ONE OPENING STRIATED CURVED ASSESSED AS SURGICAL DAMAGE. PARTIAL DELAMINATION OF PLUG STRAP DISK SHELL DUE TO ADHESIVE FAILURE. DEVICE HISTORY RECORD (DHR) DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY DEVIATIONS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS OR NON-CONFORMANCES DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT DEVICES FROM THIS WORK ORDER WERE ASSEMBLED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALLERGAN MEDICAL PROCEDURES AND SPECIFICATIONS. THE REPORTED DEVICE WAS INTACT AT THE TIME OF PRODUCTION AND MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. THE EVENTS OF LYMPHOMA-ALCL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, INFLAMMATION AND PAIN ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THESE EVENTS. REPORTED EVENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN DEVICE LABELING: ""LYMPHOMA, INCLUDING ANAPLASTIC LARGE T-CELL LYMPHOMA(ALCL) - INFORMATION FROM MEDICAL LITERATURE HAS SUGGESTED A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION, WITHOUT EVIDENCE OF CAUSATION, BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE VERY RARE OCCURRENCE OF ALCL IN THE BREAST. THE DISEASE IS EXCEPTIONALLY RARE, MAY PRESENT AS A LATE OCCURRING PERI-PROSTHETIC SEROMA, AND OCCURS IN WOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT BREAST IMPLANTS. SPECIFIC TESTING IS NEEDED TO DISTINGUISH ALCL FROM BREAST CANCER. THE MAJORITY OF REPORTED CASES HAD AN INDOLENT CLINICAL COURSE FOLLOWING CAPSULECTOMY WITH OR WITHOUT ADJUVANT THERAPY, WHICH IS GENERALLY UNCHARACTERISTIC OF SYSTEMIC ALCL. TREATMENT SHOULD BE DETERMINED IN CONSULTATION WITH A HEMATO-ONCOLOGIST."" ""FORMATION OF FIBROUS TISSUE AROUND AN IMPLANTED DEVICE IS A NORMAL PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE. FIBROUS CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE REMAINS A COMMON COMPLICATION FOLLOWING BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY AND IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. THE CAUSE OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS UNKNOWN, HOWEVER IT IS MOST LIKELY MULTIFACTORIAL AND MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HAEMATOMA, AND SEROMA. CONTRACTURE DEVELOPS TO VARYING DEGREES, UNILATERALLY OR BILATERALLY, AND MAY OCCUR WITHIN WEEKS TO YEARS AFTER SURGERY. CONTRACTURE OF THE FIBROUS CAPSULAR TISSUE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT MAY CAUSE A RANGE OF SYMPTOMS INCLUDING FIRMNESS, DISCOMFORT, PAIN, DISTORTION, PALPABILITY, AND/OR DISPLACEMENT. SEVERE CASES ARE CONSIDERED THE MOST CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT, AND MAY REQUIRE SURGICAL INTERVENTION. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY RECUR SUBSEQUENT TO CORRECTIVE SURGICAL PROCEDURES. DO NOT TREAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BY EXTERNAL COMPRESSION OR MASSAGE, WHICH MAY RESULT IN IMPLANT DAMAGE, DEFLATION, FOLDS, AND/OR HAEMATOMA."" Â¿AS EXPECTED, FOLLOWING ANY INVASIVE SURGICAL PROCEDURE, PAIN OF VARYING INTENSITY AND DURATION MAY OCCUR FOLLOWING IMPLANTATION.

PER THE FDA REGULATIONS FOR REPORTABLE EVENTS, A SERIOUS INJURY IS ONE THAT: IS LIFE THREATENING, RESULTS IN PERMANENT IMPAIRMENT OF A BODY FUNCTION OR PERMANENT DAMAGE TO A BODY STRUCTURE, OR NECESSITATES MEDICAL OR SURGICAL INTERVENTION TO PRECLUDE PERMANENT IMPAIRMENT OF A BODY FUNCTION OR PERMANENT DAMAGE TO A BODY STRUCTURE. PER THE DEFINITION NOTED ABOVE, IDEAL IMPLANT INCORPORATED UNDERSTOOD THAT A COMMON SALINE BREAST IMPLANT DEFLATION WOULD NOT FALL WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF SERIOUS INJURY AND WOULD THEREFORE NOT BE CONSIDERED REPORTABLE. ALTHOUGH SURGICAL INTERVENTION MAY BE PERFORMED TO REMOVE AND/OR REPLACE THE BREAST IMPLANT, IT IS NOT MEDICALLY REQUIRED TO PRECLUDE PERMANENT IMPAIRMENT OF A BODY FUNCTION OR PERMANENT DAMAGE TO A BODY STRUCTURE. IMPLANTS ARE FILLED WITH NORMAL SALINE, WHICH IS HARMLESSLY ABSORBED BY THE BODY. A DEFLATION POSES MINIMAL RISK TO THE PATIENT AND IS NOT CONSIDERED SERIOUS IN THE ABSENCE OF AN ADDITIONAL SERIOUS CONDITION, SUCH AS EXTRUSION, TISSUE NECROSIS, SEPSIS, LYMPHOMA (ALCL), NEUROLOGIC PROBLEM, BREAST MASS, POSSIBLE AFFECT ON FETUS, ETC. BECAUSE A DEFLATION, ABSENT OF AN ADDITIONAL SERIOUS PATIENT CONDITION, DOES NOT POSE RISK TO THE PATIENT OF DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY, IDEAL IMPLANT DID NOT CONSIDER DEFLATION OR SURGERY TO REMOVE A DEFLATED IMPLANT TO BE A ""SURGICAL INTERVENTION TO PRECLUDE PERMANENT IMPAIRMENT OF A BODY FUNCTION OR PERMANENT DAMAGE TO A BODY STRUCTURE."" A DEFLATION OR OTHER TYPE OF DEVICE MALFUNCTION, IN WHICH A SERIOUS INJURY, SERIOUS CONDITION OR DEATH IS REPORTED AS A CONSEQUENCE, WOULD BE CONSIDERED REPORTABLE.
