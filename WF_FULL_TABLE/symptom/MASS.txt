20211|14895|D|1||BECAUSE OF FIBROCYSTIC DISEASE, RPTR HAD RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY 12/20/76 WITH ANOTHER CO'S IMPLANTS. DUE TO SCAR CONTRACTURE AND TWO UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS AT CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, BOTH IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED AND THE SAME IMPLANTS WERE REINSERTED. IN 1979, THE LEFT IMPLANT WAS REPLACED WITH THIS CO'S DOUBLE LUMEN GEL/SALINE IMPLANT. AFTER EXPLANTATION SURGERY 8/17/94, LAB ANALYSIS REPORT FROM DR WAS OBTAINED EXPLAINING THE PROBLEMS WITH FAILED IMPLANTS. THE DEVICE FROM THE CONTAINER IDENTIFIED AS THE LEFT SIDE WAS EVIDENTLY THE REPLACEMENT FOR A FAILIED IMPLANT FROM THE PREVIOUS SURGERY. IT WAS IDENTIFIED AS A DOUBLE LUMEN CONSISTENT WITH PRODUCTION CIRCA 1977-78. THE CRITERIA OF IDENTIFICATION INCLUDE A LEAF VALVE EXCLUSIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CO'S PRODUCTS. THIS IS NOT A SALINE IMPLANT, IT IS A COMBINATION GEL WITH ADDED SALINE IN A SEPARATE COMPARMENT. THE LEFT IMPLANT HAD PERFORATED INNER AND OUTER SHELLS AND WAS SEVERELY CONTAMINATED BY TISSUE AND POSSIBLY MICRO-ORGANISMS AND THEIR METABOLITES. THE GEL LEAKED PROFUSELY THROUGH MULTIPLE PERFORATIONS. THE GEL WAS ALSO INVASIVE AND OF AN EASILY DISPERSED NATURE. THE LOSS OF GEL PROPERTY (REVERSION FROM A COHESIVE PRODUCT TO AN OIL-LIKE ENTITY) IS A SIGN OF CHEMICAL DEGRADATION. THE CAPSULE RECEIVED IN THE CONTAINER INDICATING THE RIGHT SIDE SHOWS A DISORGANIZED MASS OF TISSUE CONSISTENT WITH SEVERE ADVERSE REACTIONS AND FAILURE OF THE CAPSULE TO CONTAIN THE DEBRIS OF A GROSSLY LEAKING PROSTHESIS. IT ALSO INDICATES MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS AT CLOSED CAPSULOTOMIES AND POSSIBLE INFECTION. NODULAR PORTIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH GRANULOMATOUS MATERIALS FROM A PT WHO RECEIVED MULTIPLE IMPLANTS AND WHERE DEBRIDEMENT OF THE TISSUE (ABLATIVE CAPSULECTOMY) WAS NOT PERFORMED AT THE TIME OF PROSTHESIS REPLACEMENT. THE CAPSULE RECEIVED IN THE CONTAINER INDICATING THE LEFT SIDE WAS EXTENSIVELY CALCIFIED WITH PLAQUE-LIKE ENTITIES. THESE SUGGEST A PROLONGED EXPOSURE TO AGGRESSIVE CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES RESULTING IN NECROSIS AND MINERALIZATION. IT APPEARS MOST PROBLEM THAT THE CAPSULES WERE TRANSPOSED SOME TIME AFTER SURGERY. IN PRINCIPLE, THE CALCIFIED CAPSULE SHOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DOUBLE LUMEN IMPLANT. (ALSO SEE 1005399.)

12046|9795|D|1||IN 1986, RPTR WENT TO SEE HER MD WITH THE PROBLEM OF FIBRO-ADENOSIS. THE OPTION OF BREAST IMPLANTS WAS RECOMMENDED. ANOTHER DR WENT OVER THE PROCEDURE WITH RPTR AND HER HUSBAND AT THAT TIME. HE DESCRIBED THE OPERATION AND THE OUTCOME. THE DR SAID SHE WOULD HAVE A TWO INCH SCAR THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE A STRETCH MARK. HER BREASTS WOULD BE LARGER AND FIRMER. HER FUTURE CHANCES OF CANCER WOULD BY 95% AGAINST CANCER. HER MOTHER HAS HAD A MASTECTOMY, SO THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT ADVANTAGE TO HER. QUESTIONS SHE ASKED INCLUDED, SINCE SHE WAS SPORTS ORIENTED, WOULD THESE IMPLANTS BREAK OR LEAK. SHE WAS TOLD THEY WOULD NOT. SHE ALSO ASSUMED THEY WERE FDA APPROVED. SHE HAD NO IDEA THAT A HOSP WOULD PERFORM A PROCEDURE THAT HAD NOT BEEN APPROVED. AFTER DISCUSSING THE PROCEDURE, AND THE POSSIBILITY OF FUTURE CANCER, SHE CHOOSE THE BREAST IMPLANTS. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE OPERATION SHE HAD PROBLEMS. SHE NO LONGER HAD A SEPARATION BETWEEN THE BREASTS. HER BREASTS WERE AND STILL ARE LUMPY. THEY WERE TWO DIFFERENCT SIZES AND STILL ARE. THE SCARS ARE STILL LARGE AND VERY DARK IN COLOR. SHE ALSO HAS ALOT OF PAIN IN HER RIGHT BREAST. COLLAGEN INJECTIONS WERE INJECTED INTO THE SCARS TO LIGHTEN THEM. THIS DID NOT HELP. A SECOND OPERATION WAS PERFORMED TO ADJUST THE LUMPY MASS AND TO SEPARATE THE BREASTS. THE LUMPS ARE STILL PRESENT. THE ORIGINAL IMPLANTS WERE REPLACED BACK INTO HER FOR A SECOND TIME. SHE LATER FOUND OUT THAT THIS PROCEDURE SAVES MONEY BY USING THE SAME IMPLANTS A SECOND TIME. THE BREASTS ARE SEPARATED NOW. SHE WAS TOLD THE SCARS WOULD FADE AND THE PAIN WOULD DECREASE AND TO BE PATIENT. AFTER MORE VISITS SHE WAS TOLD SHE LOOKED FINE. AGAIN, SHE WAS TOLD THE SCARS WOULD FADE AND THE PAIN WOULD DECREASE. SHE WAS TOLD SHE HAD EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS  AND TO SEEK HELP WITH HER EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS DEALING WITH HER BREAST IMPLANTS. SHE WAS TOLD SHE SHOULD BE GLAD THAT SHE WAS ALIVE. THIS STATEMENT ONLY AGITATED HER MORE. EARLY IN 1991 HER MD SENT HER TO ANOTHER DR WHO DID NOT THINK HER BREASTS LOOKED RIGHT EITHER. THE DR DISCUSSED DIFFERENT IMPLANTS, CORRECTING THE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE AND CORRECTING THE SCARS. SHE COULD NOT AFFORD THE COST OF THIS SURGERY. SHE FELT IT WAS A DETERRENT TO GET RID OF HER. SHE CURRENTLY HAS PAIN IN HER BREASTS. THERE IS ALSO A BLUE COLORED AREA IN ONE BREAST. MUSCLE AND JOINT PAIN FOR NO REASON. LUMPS AND CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE ARE ALSO A PROBLEM, CAUSING THE BREAST TO BE HARD AND ABNORMALLY SHAPED. SHE HAS ALSO HAD TO HAVE LUMPS IN HER FOOT GLAND SURGICALLY REMOVED. HER HANDS AND FEET SWELL FOR NO REASON. UNEXPLAINED FATIGUE PLAQUES HER. SHE WENT FROM A B CUP TO A DEFORMED A CUP. NONE OF THESE PROBLEMS WERE DISCUSSED PRIOR TO SURGERY AND SHE IS TOLD SHE IS FINE. HOSP DOES NOT RECOGNIZE A PROBLEM WITH HER CONDITION. ALSO, AFTER RECEIVING A COPY OF HER MEDICAL REPORT, SHE HAS FOUND OUT SEVERAL DETAILS OF HER COMPLAINTS HAVE NOT BEEN DOCUMENTED.|HEYER-SCHULTE SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS, LOW PROFILE, 350 CC|3509350BC|03/16/1994|B|||*||12046.0|0LP|FTR|1.0||nan|Y|12337|||GOLETA|US|MENTOR CORP.||CA|93117||||True
12391|8696|D|1||IN 7/75, RPTR WENT TO HOSP FOR BREAST AUGMENTATION SURGERY. AFTER RECEIVING A DISSATISFYING MASTOPEXY, SHE UNDERWENT A SECOND OPERATION AT THE SAME HOSP TO HAVE SILICONE IMPLANTS PLACED IN BOTH BREASTS. SOON AFTER THE SECOND OPERATION THE IMPLANTS HARDENED IN BOTH BREASTS AND THE DR BEGAN PERFORMING A SQUEEZING TECHNIQUE TO BREAK UP THE SCAR TISSUE THAT HAD CAUSED THE IMPLANTS TO BECOME ENCAPSULATED. DURING ONE OF THE SQUEEZING EPISODES, THE LEFT BREAST IMPLANT RUPTURED AND A LOCAL OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN THE DR'S OFFICE WAS DONE TO REMOVE THE DAMAGED IMPLANT AND HE REPLACED IT WITH ANOTHER IMPLANT. EVENTUALLY, AFTER THE THIRD OPERATION, THE IMPLANTS HARDENED AGAIN CAUSING HER TREMENDOUS UNHAPPINESS. HAVING THE BREAST HARDEN AND THEN SQUEEZED BY THE DR WAS EXTREMELY DEMEANING AND PAINFUL AND CAUSED HER DISTRESS AND MENTAL ANGUISH. THIS PROBLEM CONTINUED THROUGHOUT THE NEXT THREE YRS, UNTIL ON ONE OFFICE VISIT WHEN HE WAS PERFORMING THE SQUEEZING TECHNIQUE THE LEFT IMPLANT RUPTURED ONCE MORE AND THIS TIME HE REQUESTED THAT RPTR MEET HIM AT HOSP WERE DR, HIS WIFE, AND A RN PERFORMED THE FOURTH OPERATION TO REMOVE THE RUPTURED SILICONE IMPLANT. HE DIDN'T REPLACE IT LEAVING HER WITH THE RIGHT BREAST A 34C AND THE LEFT BREAST A 34B, IN WHICH SHE USES VARIOUS PROSTHESIS TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LACK OF MASS IN THE LEFT BREAST. FOR THE LAST 17 YRS, SHE HAS HAD TO LIVE WITH AN ENCAPSULATED RIGHT IMPLANT SEALED TO THE UPPER CAVITY OF HER CHEST, HATING EVERY MINUTE IT HAS BEEN IN HER BODY. RPTR STATES THE MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL STRESS HAS BEEN HORRENDOUS TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT WHAT IT HAS CAUSED HER IMMUNE SYSTEM. SHE SUFFERS DAILY FROM RESPIRATORY ALLERGIES AND HAS TO USE ANTIHISTAMINES AND NASAL SPRAYS. INITIALLY, SHE WENT IN FOR  WHAT SHE THOUGHT WAS A SIMPLE PROCEDURE THAT WOULD ENHANCE HER SELF-ESTEEM AND THE WHOLE EPISODE RESULTED IN HER LOOKING LIKE A FREAK. RPTR FEELS THESE IMPLANTS CONTRIBUTED TO THE DESTRUCTION OF HER SANITY. ASIDE FROM THE DISCOMFORT AND THE PHYSICAL DEFORMITY, SHE THINKS THE KNOWLEDGE OF HER FEELING INHUMAN STEMMED FROM THIS HARD FOREIGN OBJECT BEING IN HER BODY AND CAUSED THE MOST PROBLEMS.

IN 1979, THE LEFT IMPLANT WAS REPLACED WITH A DOUBLE LUMEN GEL/SALINE IMPLANT. THE FOLLOWING IS FROM A LABORATORY ANALYSIS REPORT AFTER EXPLANTATION: THE IMPLANTS WERE PERFORATED AT MULTIPLE LOCATIONS. THE RECEIVED ORIGINAL RIGHT SIDE IMPLANT HAD A SEVERELY DEGRADED SHELL AS WELL AS PERFORATIONS BUT IT WAS NOT GROSLY RUPTURED. THE LEFT IMPLANT HAD PERFORATED INNER AND OUTER SHELLS AND WAS SEVERELY CONTAMINATED BY TISSUE AND POSSIBLY MICRO-ORGANISMS AND THEIR METABOLITES. THE GEL LEAKED PROFUSELY THROUGH MULTIPLE PERFORATIONS. THE GEL WAS ALSO INVASIVE AND OF AN EASILY DISPERSED NATURE. THE CAPSULE RECEIVED IN THE CONTAINER INDICATING THE RIGHT SIDE SHOWS A DISORGANIZED MASS OF TISSUE CONSISTENT WITH SEVERE ADVERSE REACTION AND FAILURE OF THE CAPSULE TO CONTAIN THE DEBRIS OF A GROSSLY LEAKING PROSTHESIS. IT ALSO INDICATES MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS AT CLOSED CAPSULOTOMIES AND POSSIBLE INFECTION. NODULAR PORTIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH GRANULOMATOUS MATERIAL AND A PT WHO RECEIVED MULTIPLE IMPLANTS AND WHERE DEBRIDEMENT OF THE TISSUE (ABLATIVE CAPSULECTOMY) WAS NOT PERFORMED AT THE TIME OF PROSTHESIS REPLACEMENT. THE CAPSULE RECEIVED IN THE CONTAINER INDICATING THE LEFT SIDE WAS EXTENSIVELY CALCIFIED WITH PLAQUE-LIKE ENTITIES. THESE SUGGEST A PROLONGED EXPOSURE TO AGGRESSIVE CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES RESULTING IN NECROSIS AND MINERALIZATION. OVERALL IMPRESSIONS SUGGEST, A PT WITH MULTIPLE PROSTHETIC MISADVENTURES AND EXTENSIVE TISSUE DAMAGE IN THE PROSTHETIC AREA IN ADDITION TO POSSIBLE METABOLIC DISTURBANCES AND SYSTEMIC EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH ABSORPTION OF MIXED BIOACTIVE SUBSTANCES ORIGINATING FROM FAULTY BREAST PROSTHESES.

""THE LYMPHOID CELLS WERE HIGHLY ATYPICAL, SHOWING ENLARGED AND IRREGULARLY CONFIGURED NUCLEI. IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS SHOWED CD30 +, ALK-, B-CELL MARKER NEGATIVE, AND T-CELL MARKER PARTIAL AND PATCHILY-POSITIVE (CD3, CD43, CD45RO, AND CD5) TISSUE. THE FINDINGS WERE CONSISTENT WITH LOCALIZED FORM OF SYSTEMIC ALCL, LARGE T-CELL LYMPHOMA."" THE BREAST HEALED, BUT A RECURRENT MASS APPEARED WEEKS LATER. ""STAGING CT OF CHEST, ABD, PELVIS AND PET SCAN SHOWED NO EVIDENCE OF DISEASE OUTSIDE THE BREAST. SHE UNDERWENT CHEMO WITH CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE, DOXORUBICIN, VINCRISTINE AND PREDNISONE IN (B)(6) 2009, THE MASS FAILED TO RESPOND AND PROGRESSED TO A WOUND. THE LYMPHOMA METASTASIZED TO THE THORACOLUMBAR REGION AND THE RIGHT LUNG AS SEEN IN THE (B)(6) 2009 PET SCAN. SHE WAS TREATED WITH RADIATION AND A SECOND ROUND OF CHEMO USING GEMCITABINE, IFOSFAMIDE, AND, VINORELBINE. SHE RESPONDED WELL AND UNDERWENT A BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT IN 12/2009.

3788317|4434473|D|1||SUBJECT: RESEARCH STUDY FOR BREAST IMPLANT RUPTURE COMPLICATIONS MESSAGE: TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT I HAVE RUPTURED SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS. THESE WERE DUPONT SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS THAT WERE INSERTED IN (B)(6) 1976. I KNOW THEY HAVE BEEN RUPTURED FOR A LONG TIME. ONE BREAST FEELS LIKE A MASS OF JELLY. THE OTHER BREAST IS HARD AND HAS THE CAPSULAR CONTRACTION. THE GEL IS OOZING OUT AND CALCIFYING ON THE OUTSIDE. I WILL BE (B)(6) OF THIS YEAR (2014). THE IMPLANTS HAVE BEEN IN FOR ALMOST 40 YEARS. I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MEDICARE COVERS THE EXPLANT AND REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT MATERIAL BUT DOES NOT COVER THE EXCHANGE OF IMPLANTS. I WAS QUOTED BY A DOCTOR (B)(6) FOR REMOVAL OF BOTH IMPLANTS AND EXCHANGE WITH NEW ONES. WHEN THEY WERE ADVISED THAT MEDICARE PAID ONLY FOR THE REMOVAL THEY THEN QUOTED ME A PRICE OF (B)(6) TO INSERT THE IMPLANT AT THE SAME TIME. I WOULD HAVE TO PAY THE (B)(6). I FAIL TO SEE THE LOGIC OF THE PRICING. HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT MY MAJOR CONCERN. DUE TO THE AGE AND MY BELIEF THAT THE RUPTURE OCCURRED YEARS AGO, I WONDER HOW MUCH OF THIS GEL HAS TRAVELED THROUGH MY BODY. THE PLASTIC SURGEON TOLD ME THAT THE SILICONE MATERIAL IN THIS PARTICULAR IMPLANT WAS VERY THIN AND JUST RAN OUT LIKE WATER. I HAVE BEEN READING ABOUT ACL AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT SILICONE LEAKAGE CAN CAUSE THIS DISEASE. IF IT DOES, I WOULD BE THE LIKELY CANDIDATE TO SEE IF THE GEL HAS TRAVELED TO THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. THIS IS MY BIGGEST CONCERN. I WAS JUST A LITTLE PUZZLED THAT THE PRICING FOR INSERTION OF NEW BREAST PROSTHESES WAS ONLY (B)(6) LESS THAN THE PROCEDURE FOR CLEANING OUT THE RUPTURED IMPLANT AND PUTTING A NEW ONE IN ITS PLACE. COULD YOU PLEASE ADVISE ME IF THERE ARE CURRENTLY ANY STUDIES GOING ON THAT PERTAIN TO MY PARTICULAR SITUATION AS I WOULD DESIRE TO BE A PARTICIPANT IN THAT STUDY. I HAVE A LETTER FROM THE RETIRED THORACIC SURGEON, DR (B)(6), WHO INSERTED THE IMPLANTS STATING THERE WAS A DEGREE OF HYPERPLASIA. MY CURRENT DOCTOR, DR (B)(6), THAT HE WAS CONCERNED THERE WOULD BE SOME DISFIGUREMENT FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANTS BECAUSE OF TISSUE REMOVAL AND PERHAPS THE NECESSITY TO REMOVE MORE AND ALSO THE FACT THAT THE TISSUE COVERING THE IMPLANT HAS BEEN EXPANDED FOR SUCH A PERIOD OF TIME.
