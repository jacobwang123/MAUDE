DEVICE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, ASYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. DEFLATION Â¿ BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS DEFLATE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. DEFLATION CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO DEFLATE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS; FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL; EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED); TRAUMA; COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING; AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME.

CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE.

DEVICE LABELING: SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANTS ARE PRONE TO UNINTENDED INSTRUMENT TRAUMA DURING IMPLANTATION OR DURING EXPLANTATION. NUMBER 1, 2 SHELL FAILURE CAN RESULT FROM DAMAGE BY SCALPELS, SUTURE NEEDLES, HYPODERMIC NEEDLES, HEMOSTATS, AND ADSON FORCEPS AND HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN EXPLANTED DEVICE SHELLS USING SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY. ALLERGANÂ¿S (RETRIEVAL STUDY) ANALYSES OF EXPLANTED DEVICES HAVE IDENTIFIED UNINTENDED SURGICAL INSTRUMENT DAMAGE AS ONE POTENTIAL CAUSE OF SHELL FAILURE AND THUS IMPLANT RUPTURE. THE PATIENT SHOULD BE TOLD THAT THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGE IN THE IMPLANT SHAPE MAY BE SIGNS OF SYMPTOMATIC RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. IF THE PATIENT HAS ANY OF THESE SIGNS, SHE SHOULD BE TOLD TO REPORT THEM AND POSSIBLY HAVE AN MRI EVALUATION TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. BREAST IMPLANTS RUPTURE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. RUPTURES CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO RUPTURE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, STRESSING THE IMPLANT DURING IMPLANTATION AND WEAKENING IT, FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL, EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED), TRAUMA, COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING, AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF RUPTURE FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT. IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF RUPTURE. LABORATORY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RUPTURE ARE ONGOING. SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SEE TABLE 3 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING MRI SCREENING. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE. IF RUPTURE OCCURS, SILICONE GEL MAY EITHER REMAIN WITHIN THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), MOVE OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE (EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), OR MOVE OUTSIDE THE BREAST (GEL MIGRATION). THERE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY THAT RUPTURE MAY PROGRESS FROM INTRACAPSULAR TO EXTRACAPSULAR AND BEYOND. IN ALLERGANÂ¿S CORE STUDY, THERE WAS A MRI SCREENING COHORT WHO HAD REGULAR MRIS TO SCREEN FOR BREAST IMPLANT RUPTURE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE SYMPTOMATIC (I.E., MRI COHORT) AND A NON-MRI SCREENING COHORT WHO WERE NOT SCREENED WITH BREAST IMPLANT MRIS (I.E., NON-MRI COHORT). THE RUPTURE RATES IN THE MRI COHORTS WERE 9.3% FOR PRIMARY AUGMENTATION, 5.4% FOR REVISION-AUGMENTATION, 35.4% FOR PRIMARY RECONSTRUCTION, AND 0% FOR REVISION-RECONSTRUCTION. THE RUPTURE RATE FOR THE WHOLE MRI COHORT IN THE CORE STUDY (INCLUDING AUGMENTATION, REVISION-AUGMENTATION, RECONSTRUCTION, AND REVISION-RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS) THROUGH 10 YEARS WAS 13.0% FOR PATIENTS AND 7.7% FOR IMPLANTS. ACROSS ALL PATIENTS IN THE CORE STUDY, ALL RUPTURES WERE INTRACAPSULAR WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 3 CASES OF EXTRACAPSULAR GEL (ONE RUPTURE PROGRESSED TO EXTRACAPSULAR GEL FOLLOWING EXPLORATORY SURGERY TO CONFIRM THE RUPTURE AND THEN IMPLANT REPLACEMENT WAS DELAYED).|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|07/21/2017||||N|R||0HP|FWM|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||NI|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.

DEVICE HISTORY RECORD REVIEW: REVIEW OF DHR FOR WORK ORDER 2183997 DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY DEVIATIONS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS OR NON-CONFORMANCES DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. ALL GEL BREAST IMPLANTS WERE REVIEWED AS PART OF THE ASSEMBLY OPERATIONS AND THESE TASKS WERE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO APPLICABLE CURRENT PROCEDURES TO ENSURE THAT ASSEMBLY MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. THE DHR ASSEMBLY REPORT FROM SAP WAS VERIFIED AND THERE WAS NO SCRAP RELATED WITH REPORTED EVENT, ALL DEVICES WERE CONFORMANCE DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION GATHERED DURING THE DHR REVIEW, THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT DEVICES FROM WORK ORDER 2183997 WERE ASSEMBLED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALLERGAN MEDICAL PROCEDURES AND SPECIFICATIONS. THE REPORTED DEVICE WAS INTACT AT THE TIME OF PRODUCTION AND MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. REPORTED EVENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN THE LABELING: PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENT. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. YOU SHOULD PERFORM SELF-EXAMINATION OF YOUR BREASTS EVERY MONTH FOR CANCER SCREENING. HOWEVER, THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU DISTINGUISH THE IMPLANT FROM YOUR BREAST TISSUE. THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGES IN IMPLANT SHAPE, MAY BE SIGNS OF A RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. THESE SIGNS SHOULD BE REPORTED TO YOUR SURGEON AND POSSIBLY EVALUATED WITH AN MRI. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.|INSPIRA TEXTURED SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|N-TRM445|05/10/2017||||N|R||0HP|FTR|1.0|10/11/2016|PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||2183997|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS.

RUPTURES CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO RUPTURE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, STRESSING THE IMPLANT DURING IMPLANTATION AND WEAKENING IT, FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL, EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED), TRAUMA, COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING, AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF RUPTURE FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT. IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF RUPTURE. LABORATORY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RUPTURE ARE ONGOING. SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE. IF RUPTURE OCCURS, SILICONE GEL MAY EITHER REMAIN WITHIN THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), MOVE OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE (EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), OR MOVE OUTSIDE THE BREAST (GEL MIGRATION). THERE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY THAT RUPTURE MAY PROGRESS FROM INTRACAPSULAR TO EXTRACAPSULAR AND BEYOND. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE: PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION|INSPIRA SMOOTH SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|N-SSM275|01/25/2017||02/17/2017|DA|R|Y||0HP|FTR|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||2690610|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CASES REFERENCED IN THE NOTICE IS 359, INCLUDING 9 DEATHS. THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE NOTICE CLASSIFIES THE ALCL EVENTS IN DIFFERENT CATEGORIES, INCLUDING TYPES OF DEVICE, ASSOCIATED ADVERSE EVENTS, PRESENTATION, AND DIAGNOSIS DETAILS, BUT DOES NOT IDENTIFY SPECIFIC DEVICES OR PATIENTS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO INDIVIDUALIZE THIS INFORMATION INTO SPECIFIC REPORTS, AND BY DEFINITION ALREADY INCLUDES EVENTS REPORTED BY ALLERGAN IN THE PAST. THEREFORE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH 21 CFR 803, THIS REPORT WILL REPRESENT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF RECEIPT OF THE NOTICE AND DOCUMENTATION OF ALLERGAN'S ATTEMPT TO INVESTIGATE ADVERSE EVENTS IDENTIFIED IN THAT NOTICE. THIS REPORT WILL NOT SUBSTITUTE FOR ANY INVESTIGATION INTO COMPLAINTS RECEIVED WHERE INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS OR ALLERGAN DEVICES ARE IDENTIFIED, INCLUSIVE OR EXCLUSIVE OF THE 359 CASES MENTIONED IN THE NOTICE. (B)(4). THE EVENTS OF DEATH, LYMPHOMA-ALCL, LYMPHOMA, SEROMA, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, AND BREAST LUMPS ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THESE EVENTS. SALINE DEVICE LABELING: RADIATION TO THE BREAST Â¿ ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE IN VIVO EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, ASYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER THESE ADDITIONAL SURGERIES. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF DEFLATION. ADDITIONAL COMPLICATIONS Â¿ AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. CALCIUM DEPOSITS CAN FORM IN THE TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT WITH SYMPTOMS THAT MAY INCLUDE PAIN AND FIRMNESS. LYMPHADENOPATHY HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED IN SOME WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS. IN THE PASS STUDY, AT LEAST 1 REOPERATION WAS PERFORMED ON 315 PATIENTS (36.5%) THROUGH 10 YEARS. A TOTAL OF 424 REOPERATIONS WERE PERFORMED. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR REOPERATION THROUGH 10 YEARS ON AUGMENTATION PATIENTS WAS IMPLANT DEFLATION AT 21.7%. THE PERCENTAGE OF REOPERATIONS DUE TO LUMP/MASS/CYST INCREASED FROM 8.5% OF 293 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 5 YEARS TO 13.9% OF 424 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 10 YEARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF LUMPS, MASSES, AND CYSTS CAN BE EXPECTED TO NATURALLY INCREASE AS PATIENTS AGE AND COULD BE AN EXPLANATION FOR THE INCREASE. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.

DEATHS MUST BE REPORTED TO ALLERGAN AND FDA. SILICONE DEVICE LABELING: ONE OF THE KEY COMPLICATIONS REPORTED IS CALLED Â¿CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE.Â¿ CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS A TIGHTENING OF THE SCAR TISSUE (ALSO CALLED A CAPSULE) THAT NORMALLY FORMS AROUND THE BREAST IMPLANT DURING THE HEALING PROCESS AFTER SURGERY. IN SOME WOMEN, THE SCAR TISSUE (CAPSULE) SQUEEZES THE IMPLANT. THIS RESULTS IN FIRMNESS OR HARDENING OF THE BREAST, AND IT IS A RISK FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE. DEGREES OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE ARE CLASSIFIED BY THE BAKER GRADING SCALE.1 CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BAKER GRADES III AND IV ARE THE MOST SEVERE. BAKER GRADE III OFTEN RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SURGERY (REOPERATION) BECAUSE OF PAIN AND POSSIBLY ABNORMAL APPEARANCE. BAKER GRADE IV USUALLY RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR REOPERATION BECAUSE OF PAIN AND UNACCEPTABLE APPEARANCE. DO NOT TREAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BY CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY OR FORCEFUL EXTERNAL COMPRESSION, WHICH WILL LIKELY RESULT IN IMPLANT DAMAGE, RUPTURE, FOLDS, AND/OR HEMATOMA. ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. YOU SHOULD PERFORM SELF-EXAMINATION OF YOUR BREASTS EVERY MONTH FOR CANCER SCREENING. HOWEVER, THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU DISTINGUISH THE IMPLANT FROM YOUR BREAST TISSUE. THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGES IN IMPLANT SHAPE, MAY BE SIGNS OF A RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. THESE SIGNS SHOULD BE REPORTED TO YOUR SURGEON AND POSSIBLY EVALUATED WITH AN MRI. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT.

FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTER REGARDING THE EVENT, PRODUCT, AND/OR PATIENT DETAILS WAS REQUESTED. NO FURTHER FOLLOW UP IS POSSIBLE, AS THE CORRESPONDING AUTHOR IS DECEASED. DEVICE LABELING: THE STRESSES OF THE EXPANDING DEVICE MAY INDUCE PRESSURE ISCHEMIA AND NECROSIS, ESPECIALLY IN TIGHT OR THIN-SKINNED AREAS. FOLDS IN A PARTIALLY FILLED TISSUE EXPANDER MAY ALSO RESULT IN THINNING AND EROSION OF ADJACENT TISSUE. EXCESSIVELY RAPID TISSUE EXPANSION MAY COMPROMISE THE VASCULARITY OF THE OVERLYING TISSUE. AS EXPECTED FOLLOWING ANY INVASIVE SURGICAL PROCEDURE, PAIN OF VARYING INTENSITY AND DURATION MAY OCCUR FOLLOWING TISSUE EXPANDER PLACEMENT. IN ADDITION, THE EXPANSION PROCESS MAY CAUSE SOME DISCOMFORT, BUT SHOULD NOT CAUSE EXCESSIVE PAIN. PAIN MAY INDICATE EXPANSION BEYOND TISSUE TOLERANCE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN ISCHEMIA AND NECROSIS. PAIN MAY ALSO ACCOMPANY OTHER ADVERSE REACTIONS. UNEXPLAINED PAIN MUST BE PROMPTLY INVESTIGATED. FURTHER EXPANSION SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED UNTIL THE PAIN IS RESOLVED. ACTIVE INFECTION ANYWHERE IN THE BODY MAY INCREASE RISK OF PERIPROSTHETIC INFECTION. DO NOT EXPOSE THE TISSUE EXPANDER OR INJECTION NEEDLES TO CONTAMINANTS, WHICH INCREASE THE RISK OF INFECTION. PATIENTS WHO PRESENT WOUND DEHISCENCE, TISSUE EROSION, ISCHEMIA OR NECROSIS RUN AN INCREASED RISK OF PERIPROSTHETIC INFECTION. MEASURES TO PROTECT SUCH AREAS FROM INFECTION SHOULD BE TAKEN.

ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL."""|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|04/17/2017||||N|R||0HP|FWM|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||NI|||||UNKNOWN MANUFACTURER|||||||True

BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. REPORTS IN THE MEDICAL LITERATURE INDICATE THAT PATIENTS WITH BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT AT A GREATER RISK THAN THOSE WITHOUT BREAST IMPLANTS FOR DEVELOPING BREAST CANCER. REPORTS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT BREAST IMPLANTS MAY INTERFERE WITH OR DELAY BREAST CANCER DETECTION BY MAMMOGRAPHY AND/OR BIOPSY; HOWEVER, OTHER REPORTS IN THE PUBLISHED MEDICAL LITERATURE INDICATE THAT BREAST IMPLANTS NEITHER SIGNIFICANTLY DELAY BREAST CANCER DETECTION NOR ADVERSELY AFFECT CANCER SURVIVAL OF WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS. A LARGE FOLLOW-UP STUDY REPORTED NO EVIDENCE OF AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND CANCER, AND EVEN SHOWED A DECREASED INCIDENCE OF BREAST CANCER COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION. ONE STUDY HAS REPORTED AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF BRAIN CANCER IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS AS COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION. THE INCIDENCE OF BRAIN CANCER, HOWEVER, WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS WHEN COMPARED TO WOMEN WHO HAD OTHER PLASTIC SURGERIES A PUBLISHED REVIEW OF 4 LARGE STUDIES IN WOMEN WITH COSMETIC IMPLANTS AND AN ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP STUDY CONCLUDED THAT THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT SUPPORT AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BRAIN CANCER AND BREAST IMPLANTS. AN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL REVIEW ALSO LENT SUPPORT TO THE LACK OF CAUSATION BETWEEN IMPLANTS AND ANY TYPE OF CANCER. STUDIES HAVE REPORTED AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF RESPIRATORY/LUNG CANCER IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS. OTHER STUDIES OF WOMEN IN SWEDEN AND DENMARK HAVE FOUND THAT WOMEN WHO GET BREAST IMPLANTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE CURRENT SMOKERS THAN WOMEN WHO GET BREAST REDUCTION SURGERY OR OTHER TYPES OF COSMETIC SURGERY. SEVERAL LARGE STUDIES HAVE FOUND NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND RESPIRATORY/LUNG CANCER. TWO STUDIES REPORTED AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF CERVICAL/VULVAR CANCER IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS. ANOTHER LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP STUDY SHOWED EQUIVALENT INCIDENCES OF CERVICAL CANCER IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION. OTHER RECENT LARGE STUDIES CONCLUDED THAT THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT SUPPORT AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM CANCERS AND BREAST IMPLANTS. THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL STUDIES PUBLISHED THAT EXAMINED THE RISK OF OTHER TYPES OF CANCERS, E.G., THYROID CANCERS, URINARY SYSTEM CANCERS, SARCOMA, ENDOCRINE CANCER, CONNECTIVE TISSUE CANCER, CANCER OF THE EYE, AND UNSPECIFIED CANCERS IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS.

DEVICE LABELING: BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.

DEVICE LABELING: SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANTS ARE PRONE TO UNINTENDED INSTRUMENT TRAUMA DURING IMPLANTATION OR DURING EXPLANTATION.1, 2 SHELL FAILURE CAN RESULT FROM DAMAGE BY SCALPELS, SUTURE NEEDLES, HYPODERMIC NEEDLES, HEMOSTATS, AND ADSON FORCEPS AND HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN EXPLANTED DEVICE SHELLS USING SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY.1 ALLERGANÂ¿S (RETRIEVAL STUDY) ANALYSES OF EXPLANTED DEVICES HAVE IDENTIFIED UNINTENDED SURGICAL INSTRUMENT DAMAGE AS ONE POTENTIAL CAUSE OF SHELL FAILURE AND THUS IMPLANT RUPTURE. THE PATIENT SHOULD BE TOLD THAT THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGE IN THE IMPLANT SHAPE MAY BE SIGNS OF SYMPTOMATIC RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. IF THE PATIENT HAS ANY OF THESE SIGNS, SHE SHOULD BE TOLD TO REPORT THEM AND POSSIBLY HAVE AN MRI EVALUATION TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY.

RUPTURES CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO RUPTURE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, STRESSING THE IMPLANT DURING IMPLANTATION AND WEAKENING IT, FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL, EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED), TRAUMA, COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING, AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF RUPTURE FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT. IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF RUPTURE. LABORATORY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RUPTURE ARE ONGOING. SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE. IF RUPTURE OCCURS, SILICONE GEL MAY EITHER REMAIN WITHIN THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), MOVE OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE (EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), OR MOVE OUTSIDE THE BREAST (GEL MIGRATION).

BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM.

SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM.

RUPTURES CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO RUPTURE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, STRESSING THE IMPLANT DURING IMPLANTATION AND WEAKENING IT, FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL, EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED), TRAUMA, COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING, AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF RUPTURE FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT. IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF RUPTURE. LABORATORY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RUPTURE ARE ONGOING. SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SEE TABLE 3 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING MRI SCREENING. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE. IF RUPTURE OCCURS, SILICONE GEL MAY EITHER REMAIN WITHIN THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), MOVE OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE (EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), OR MOVE OUTSIDE THE BREAST (GEL MIGRATION).|STYLE 45 SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|45-550|07/25/2017||||N|R||0HP|FTR|1.0|06/06/2005|PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||554282|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

THE REPORTED EVENTS ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THESE EVENTS. REVIEW OF DHR (DEVICE HISTORY RECORD) FOR WORK ORDER (B)(4) DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY DEVIATIONS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS OR NON-CONFORMANCES DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. ALL GEL BREAST IMPLANTS WERE REVIEWED AS PART OF THE ASSEMBLY OPERATIONS AND THESE TASKS WERE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO APPLICABLE CURRENT PROCEDURES TO ENSURE THAT ASSEMBLY MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. DHR FOR WORK ORDER (B)(4) INDICATES THAT THERE WAS A REPROCESS FOR TWO UNITS ON THE PRIMARY PACKAGING OPERATION, HOWEVER THIS WAS COMPLETED ON A DIFFERENT SERIAL NUMBER UNIT AND THIS HAS NO RELATION NEITHER CAN CAUSE THE REPORTED EVENT. THE DHR ASSEMBLY REPORT FROM ORACLE WAS VERIFIED AND THERE WAS NOT ANY SCRAP RELATED WITH REPORTED EVENT, ALL DEVICES WERE CONFORMANCE DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION GATHERED DURING THE DHR REVIEW, THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT DEVICES FROM WORK ORDER (B)(4) WERE ASSEMBLED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALLERGAN MEDICAL PROCEDURES AND SPECIFICATIONS. THE REPORTED DEVICE WAS INTACT AT THE TIME OF PRODUCTION AND MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. REPORTED EVENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN THE LABELING: ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. YOU SHOULD PERFORM SELF-EXAMINATION OF YOUR BREASTS EVERY MONTH FOR CANCER SCREENING. HOWEVER, THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU DISTINGUISH THE IMPLANT FROM YOUR BREAST TISSUE. THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGES IN IMPLANT SHAPE, MAY BE SIGNS OF A RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. THESE SIGNS SHOULD BE REPORTED TO YOUR SURGEON AND POSSIBLY EVALUATED WITH AN MRI. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.|INSPIRA TEXTURED SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|TRM310|05/04/2017||||N|R||0HP|FTR|1.0|09/14/2011|PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||1327562|KILBRIDE INDUSTRIAL ESTATE||ARKLOW, COUNTY WICKLOW||ALLERGAN (ARKLOW)|||||||True

ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM.

THE REPORTED EVENTS ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THESE EVENTS. REPORTED EVENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN THE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|05/18/2017||||N|R||0HP|FWM|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||NI|||||UNKNOWN MANUFACTURER|||||||True

6571985|75334429|N|1||ARTICLE CITATION: Â¿COMMENTARY ON: CLINICAL EVALUATION OF SHAPED GEL BREAST IMPLANT ROTATION USING HIGH-RESOLUTION ULTRASOUND,Â¿ BY BRADLEY P. BENGSTON, MD, FACS, PUBLISHED IN AESTHETIC SURGERY JOURNAL, VOL. 37, ISSUE 3, 01MAR2017 PP. 297-300. THE EVENT OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, BAKER GRADE IV, IS A PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLAINT, AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THESE EVENTS. FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTER REGARDING THE EVENT, PRODUCT, AND/OR PATIENT DETAILS WAS REQUESTED. DEVICE LABELING: Â¿POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE.Â¿ Â¿CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER THESE ADDITIONAL SURGERIES. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF DEFLATION.Â¿|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|05/17/2017||||N|R||0HP|FWM|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||NI|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTER REGARDING THE EVENT, PRODUCT, AND/OR PATIENT DETAILS WAS REQUESTED. NO FURTHER FOLLOW UP IS POSSIBLE, AS THE CORRESPONDING AUTHOR IS DECEASED. DEVICE LABELING: ACTIVE INFECTION ANYWHERE IN THE BODY MAY INCREASE RISK OF PERIPROSTHETIC INFECTION. DO NOT EXPOSE THE TISSUE EXPANDER OR INJECTION NEEDLES TO CONTAMINANTS, WHICH INCREASE THE RISK OF INFECTION. PATIENTS WHO PRESENT WOUND DEHISCENCE, TISSUE EROSION, ISCHEMIA OR NECROSIS RUN AN INCREASED RISK OF PERIPROSTHETIC INFECTION. MEASURES TO PROTECT SUCH AREAS FROM INFECTION SHOULD BE TAKEN. SIGNS OF ACUTE INFECTION REPORTED IN ASSOCIATION WITH TISSUE EXPANDERS INCLUDE, TENDERNESS, FLUID ACCUMULATION, PAIN AND FEVER. INFECTION MAY COMPROMISE THE EXPANSION PROCESS. POSTOPERATIVE INFECTIONS SHOULD BE TREATED AGGRESSIVELY ACCORDING TO STANDARD MEDICAL PRACTICES TO AVOID MORE SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS. INFECTION THAT IS UNRESPONSIVE TO TREATMENT OR NECROTIZING INFECTION MAY REQUIRE PREMATURE TISSUE EXPANDER REMOVAL. INFECTION IS AN INHERENT RISK FOLLOWING ANY TYPE OF INVASIVE SURGERY, AND MAY OCCUR DURING THE TISSUE EXPANSION PROCESS. PATIENTS WHO PRESENT WITH WOUND DEHISCENCE, TISSUE EROSION, ISCHEMIA OR NECROSIS, AND PATIENTS UNDERGOING IMMEDIATE BREAST RECONSTRUCTION RUN AN INCREASED RISK OF PERIPROSTHETIC INFECTION. SIGNS OF ACUTE INFECTION REPORTED IN ASSOCIATION WITH TISSUE EXPANDERS INCLUDE ERYTHEMA, TENDERNESS, FLUID ACCUMULATION, PAIN AND FEVER. ERYTHEMA MAY ALSO OCCUR AS A NORMAL RESPONSE TO EXPANSION. ASPIRATION TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THIS TYPE OF ERYTHEMA AND ERYTHEMA AS A SIGN OF EARLY INFECTION IS A RECOGNIZED PRECAUTION. RESEARCH IDENTIFIES STAPHYLOCOCCUS AND PSEUDOMONAS ORGANISMS IN ASSOCIATION WITH INFECTION AROUND TISSUE EXPANDERS. ESCHERICHIA AND STREPTOCOCCUS ORGANISMS HAVE ALSO BEEN NOTED IN ASSOCIATION WITH TISSUE EXPANDERS IN THE LOWER EXTREMITIES. INFECTION MAY OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER SURGERY, AND MAY COMPROMISE THE EXPANSION PROCESS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE RELATED TO INFECTION IN THE AREA SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT. POSTOPERATIVE INFECTIONS SHOULD BE TREATED AGGRESSIVELY ACCORDING TO STANDARD MEDICAL PRACTICES TO AVOID MORE SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS. INFECTION THAT IS UNRESPONSIVE TO TREATMENT OR NECROTIZING INFECTION MAY REQUIRE PREMATURE BREAST TISSUE EXPANDER REMOVAL. IN RARE INSTANCES, ACUTE INFECTION MAY OCCUR IN A BREAST WITH IMPLANTS. THE SIGNS OF ACUTE INFECTION INCLUDE ERYTHEMA, TENDERNESS, FLUID ACCUMULATION,PAIN, AND FEVER. VERY RARELY, TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME, A POTENTIALLY LIFE-THREATENING CONDITION, HAS BEEN REPORTED IN WOMEN AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY. IT IS CHARACTERIZED BY SYMPTOMS THAT OCCUR SUDDENLY AND INCLUDE HIGH FEVER (102Â°F, 38.8Â°C OR HIGHER), VOMITING, DIARRHEA, A SUNBURN-LIKE RASH, RED EYES, DIZZINESS, LIGHTHEADEDNESS, MUSCLE ACHES, AND DROPS IN BLOOD PRESSURE, WHICH MAY CAUSE FAINTING. PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED TO CONTACT A PHYSICIAN IMMEDIATELY FOR DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT FOR ANY OF THESE SYMPTOMS. POSTOPERATIVE HEMATOMA AND SEROMA MAY CONTRIBUTE TO INFECTION. POSTOPERATIVE HEMATOMA AND SEROMA MAY BE MINIMIZED BY METICULOUS ATTENTION TO HEMOSTASIS DURING SURGERY, AND POSSIBLY BY POSTOPERATIVE USE OF CLOSED DRAINS. PERSISTENT, EXCESSIVE BLEEDING MUST BE CONTROLLED BEFORE THE DEVICE IS IMPLANTED.

OF THIS YR THE PT HAD HER ANNUAL MAMMOGRAM WHICH WAS MORE DIFFICULT THAN USUAL AND LEFT HER WITH EXTENSIVE BRUISING AND SWELLING IN THE RT. BREAST. A F/U MAMMOGRAM REVEALED A RUPTURE OF THE RT IMPLANT. THE PT WAS TAKEN TO SURGERY AND THE RT IMPLANT WAS FOUND TO BE HEAVILY CALCIFIED WITH A VERY CRUNCHY TEXTURE AND COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF CHALKY FLUID WITH BITS OF CALCIUM FLECKS EXTRUDED FROM THE CAPSULAR OPENING. THE IMPLANT WAS FOUND TO HAVE A RUPTURE IN THE UPPER OUTER QUADRANT WHICH WAS DEMONSTRATED ON THE MAMMOGRAM. THE WALL OF THE IMPLANT WAS ESSENTIALLY DISINTEGRATING AND HAD VERY LITTLE INTEGRITY ACCOUNTING FOR THE PROBABLE SILICONE LEAKING.

I FOLLOWED UP WITH MY PLASTIC SURGEON AT LEAST TWICE A WEEK. BREAST SURGERY WAS VERY PAINFUL. ON THIRD WEEK POST-SURGERY, I HAD SEVERAL MEDICAL COMPLAINTS: HEADACHE, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, NUMBNESS OF FACE, AND EVENTUALLY MOTTLING, REDNESS AND SWELLING OF LEFT BREAST, SWELLING ON PORT BELOW INTRA-MAMMARY FOLD. I HAD SEVERAL VISITS TO URGENT CARE, EMERGENCY HOSPITAL, AND DOCTORS' OFFICES. I DEVELOPED FEVER AND CELLULITIS ON BREAST; WHICH FELT LIKE A BALLOON. I WENT TO URGENT CARE ON (B)(6) 2012; WAS GIVEN VANCOMYCIN IV. THE NEXT DAY, I FELT THAT THE LEFT BREAST DEFLATED AND AREA AROUND PORT (INTRA-MAMMARY FOLD) FILLED WITH MORE FLUID. I SAW MY SURGEON WHO ORDERED ADMISSION TO HOSPITAL FOR SURGICAL EXPLANTATION, IRRIGATION, AND DEBRIDEMENT. SURGERY WAS PERFORMED ON THE NEXT DAY, (B)(6) 2012. CLOUDY SEROMA AND GRANULATION TISSUE WAS EVACUATED AND SALINE BREAST EXPANDER AND PORT WAS REMOVED. SAMPLES OF FLUID AND TISSUE WERE SUBMITTED FOR CULTURE AND SENSITIVITY TESTING, BUT NO HISTOPATHOLOGICAL SAMPLES WERE TAKEN. SHE SAID THAT THE IMPLANT WILL BE SUBMITTED FOR EXAMINATION AND THEN RETURNED TO MFR. I WAS GIVEN CONTINUOUS VANCOMYCIN TREATMENT FOR 2 DAYS AND WAS PRESCRIBED CIPRO AND ORAL PAIN MEDS. I HAD FOLLOW-UP VISITS AT HER OFFICE AND 2 DRAIN TUBES WERE REMOVED AFTER SEVERAL DAYS. THE INITIAL CULTURE TEST RESULTS AT (B)(6) CAME OUT AS ACID-FAST BACILLI, A FAST GROWER. I SAW AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR FOR EMPIRICAL TREATMENT WHILE WAITING FOR SENSITIVITY TESTING RESULTS. I STARTED WITH A COMBINATION TREATMENT OF CLARITHROMYCIN AND DOXYCYCLINE. THE TREATMENT WAS CONCURRED BY MY CURRENT INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR AT (B)(6) HOSPITAL. THE SAMPLE WAS SENT TO (B)(6) FOR FURTHER IDENTIFICATION AND SENSITIVITY TESTING. RESULTS OF THE TEST IDENTIFIED AS M. FORTUITUM, SENSITIVE TO CLARITHROMYCIN, BUT RESISTANT TO DOXYCYCLINE. MY INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR, REPLACED THE DOXYCYCLINE TO CIPRO IN COMBINATION WITH CLARITHROMYCIN. I FINALLY CONSULTED WITH (B)(6); WELL KNOWN EXPERTS IN DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF MYCOBACTERIAL INFECTIONS. I WANTED TO GET A ""DEFINITE REGARDING CAUSE"" OF PERSISTENT FIBRINOUS NODULAR TISSUE ON MY LEFT BREAST AND AXILLA. I FINALLY SAW AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR, WHO THEN PRESENTED MY CASE FOR REVIEW AT THEIR DEPARTMENT STAFF MEETING. ASSESSMENT WAS POSSIBLE MYCOBACTERIUM FORTUITUM IATROGENIC HEALTH CARE ASSOCIATED INFECTION OF THE LEFT BREAST IMPLANT. BECAUSE OF ABSENCE OF PERI-OPERATIVE PATHOLOGY TO LOOK FOR GRANULOMAS, NOR ABILITY TO RE-CULTURE THE SITE, PLAN WAS TO GET MRI OF RESIDUAL BREAST TISSUE AND CONSULT WITH SURGEON WHO SPECIALIZED IN MYCOBACTERIAL INFECTIONS. MRI RESULTS: SOME ABNORMAL FINDINGS, BUT COULD NOT RULE OUT IF THIS IS DUE TO INFECTIOUS DISEASE OR POST-SURGICAL CHANGES. I SAW A SURGEON AT (B)(6). SHE CONCURRED WITH (B)(6) TREATMENT OF 6 MONTHS ANTIBIOTICS AND RETURN APPOINTMENT FOR REASSESSMENT IN 3 MONTHS. ANTIBIOTIC COMBINATION WERE PRESCRIBED, CHANGED FROM TIME TO TIME TO PREVENT BACTERIAL RESISTANCE AND SIDE EFFECTS. ON THE LAST FEW WEEKS OF TREATMENT, I WAS SWITCHED TO TAKING SULFISOXAZOLE/TRIMETHOPRIM ALONE BECAUSE I WAS NOT ABLE TO TOLERATE THE SIDE EFFECTS FROM AVELOX, CIPRO, ETC. ON (B)(6) 2012, I HAD A RETURN DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT AND MRI AND BLOOD TEST AT (B)(6). SURGEON'S ASSESSMENT WAS THAT I HAVE NO APPARENT LESION OF MYCOBACTERIAL DISEASE. MY INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR WITHDREW ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT ON (B)(6). I STARTED HAVING STOMACH PAINS RIGHT AFTER I WITHDREW MY ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT. THE PAIN CONTINUED AND SPREAD ON THE ABDOMEN SPECIALLY ON THE LEFT LOWER QUADRANT. MY OBGYN DOCTOR PERFORMED ENDOMETRIAL BIOPSY WHICH RESULT WAS NEGATIVE. MY GASTROENTEROLOGIST ALSO PERFORMED COLONOSCOPY LAST WEEK AND AWAITING FOR RESULTS OF THE BIOPSY. HE SUGGESTED BREATH TEST TO RULE OUT SIBO. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF I GET AN IMPROVEMENT FROM THE COLON CLEANSING BEFORE I SCHEDULE TESTING.

BASED ON INFO REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL, BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGAN'S AND OTHER MFRS' BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMENT FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION SHOWED A SYMMETRICAL BREASTS WITH NO OVERLYING SKIN OR NIPPLE CHANGES. THERE WERE TWO LARGE MOBILE NODES PALPABLE IN THE LEFT AXILLA. INITIAL BREAST MAMMOGRAPHY AND ULTRASONOGRAPHY CONFIRMED LEFT AXILLARY LYMPHADENOPATHY BUT DID NOT SHOW ANY PERI-IMPLANT FLUID COLLECTION. BIOPSY OF THE LEFT AXILLARY MASS SHOWED FINDINGS CONSISTENT WITH CLASSIC HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA, NODULAR SCLEROSING TYPE. IT LACKED TWO TYPICAL STAINS-CD15 AND PAX5. PET-CT SHOWED A 5-CM AREA OF PET-AVID LEFT AXILLARY LYMPHADENOPATHY. HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA STAGE IA WAS DIAGNOSED. THE PT THEN HAD TWO CYCLES OF ADRIAMYCIN, BLEOMYCIN, VINBLASTINE, AND DACARBAZINE (ABVD) AND 2000 GY OF FIELD RADIATION TO THE LEFT AXILLA. HER INITIAL TREATMENT WAS COMPLETED IN (B)(6) 2011. F/U CT SCAN IN (B)(6) 2011, SHOWED A DECREASE IN THE SIZE OF THE LEFT AXILLARY LYMPHADENOPATHY. UNILATERAL FLUID COLLECTION, HOWEVER, WAS NOTED AROUND THE LEFT BREAST IMPLANT (FIGURE). THE FLUID INCREASED IN SIZE AND SHE PRESENTED 6 MONTHS ALTER WITH LEAKAGE OF SEROUS FLUID FROM HER LEFT BREAST. CYTOLOGY OF THE PERI-IMPLANT FLUID SHOWED CD30+ LYMPHOMA CELLS OF INDETERMINATE LINEAGE. DIFFERENT DIAGNOSIS INCLUDED RECURRENT HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA OR IMPLANT-ASSOCIATED ANAPLASTIC LARGE-CELL LYMPHOMA. REPEAT PET-CT SHOWED PET-AVID AREAS ON BILATERAL AXILLARY LYMPH NODES.

F/U SONOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT BREAST 1 MONTH LATER SHOWED A HYPOECHOIC MASS. BIOPSY OF THE MASS SHOWED SIMILAR CELLS FROM THE PERI-IMPLANT FLUID, WHICH WERE CD30+ LYMPHOMA CELLS OF INDETERMINATE ORIGIN. THE MASS WAS RESECTED IN (B)(6) 2012, AND PATHOLOGICAL TESTS SHOWED (B)(6), SEROMA-ASSOCIATED (LARGE-CELL LYMPHOMA (ALK-NEGATIVE ALCL).

SUBSTANTIAL OVERLAP IN MORPHOLOGY AND IMMUNOPHENOTYPE OF CELLS FROM THE INITIAL AXILLARY LYMPH NODE BIOPSY, THE PERI-IMPLANT FLUID AND THE FINAL LEFT BREAST MASS BIOPSY SUGGESTED THE SAME MANIFESTATIONS OF THE ALCL.

ALLERGAN LABELING ADDRESSES THE EVENT OF BREAST LUMPS AS FOLLOWS: BREAST SELF-EXAMINATIONS: FOLLOWING BREAST AUGMENTATION, YOU SHOULD CONTINUE TO PERFORM BREAST SELF-EXAMINATION MONTHLY. THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH A BREAST IMPLANT IN PLACE. TO CONTINUE TO PERFORM A MONTHLY BREAST SELF EXAMINATION EFFICIENTLY, YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU IDENTIFY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLANT AND YOUR BREAST TISSUE. BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE IMPLANT FROM BREAST TISSUE WILL DECREASE THE NECESSITY OF EXCESSIVE SQUEEZING OF THE IMPLANT DURING EXAMINATION. ANY NEW LUMPS SHOULD BE EVALUATED WITH A BIOPSY, AS APPROPRIATE. IF A BIOPSY IS PERFORMED, BE SURE TO INFORM THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL PERFORMING THE BIOPSY THAT YOU HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS SO THAT CARE WILL BE TAKEN TO AVOID INJURING THE IMPLANT. THE 410 DEVICE LABELING ADDRESSES ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL): BASED ON INFO REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGAN'S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERS' BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.

A LARGE, LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP FOUND NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE RISK RATES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CANCERS, INCLUDING STOMACH CANCER, LEUKEMIA, AND LYMPHOMA. IN THE (B)(4) STUDY, AT LEAST 1 REOPERATION WAS PERFORMED ON 315 PTS (36.5%) THROUGH 10 YEARS. A TOTAL OF 424 REOPERATIONS WERE PERFORMED. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR REOPERATION THROUGH 10 YEARS ON AUGMENTATION PATIENTS WAS IMPLANT DEFLATION AT 21.7%. THE PERCENTAGE OF REOPERATIONS DUE TO LUMP/MASS/CYST INCREASED FROM 8.5% OF 293 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 5 YEARS TO 13.9% OF 424 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 10 YEARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF LUMPS, MASSES, AND CYSTS CAN BE EXPECTED TO NATURALLY INCREASE AS PTS AGE AND COULD BE AN EXPLANATION FOR THE INCREASE. IN RARE INSTANCES, ACUTE INFECTION MAY OCCUR IN A BREAST WITH IMPLANTS. THE SIGNS OF ACUTE INFECTION INCLUDE ERYTHEMA, TENDERNESS, FLUID ACCUMULATION, PAIN, AND FEVER. VERY RARELY, TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME, A POTENTIALLY LIFE-THREATENING CONDITION, HAS BEEN REPORTED IN WOMEN AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY. IT IS CHARACTERIZED BY SYMPTOMS THAT OCCUR SUDDENLY AND INCLUDE HIGH FEVER (102 DEGREE F, 38.8 DEGREE C OR HIGHER), VOMITING, DIARRHEA, A SUNBURN-LIKE RASH, RED EYES, DIZZINESS, LIGHTHEADEDNESS, MUSCLE ACHES, AND DROPS IN BLOOD PRESSURE, WHICH MAY CAUSE FAINTING.

BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS DEFLATE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR A HOLE. DEFLATION CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO DEFLATE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS; FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL; EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED); TRAUMA; COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING; AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF DEFLATION FOR ALLERGAN'S PRODUCT; HOWEVER, IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF DEFLATION.

AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. CALCIUM DEPOSITS CAN FORM IN THE TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT WITH SYMPTOMS THAT MAY INCLUDE PAIN AND FIRMNESS. LYMPHADENOPATHY HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED IN SOME WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS. PUBLISHED STUDIES INDICATE THAT BREAST CANCER IS NO MORE COMMON IN WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS THAN THOSE WITHOUT IMPLANTS. A LARGE, LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP FOUND NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE RISK RATES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CANCERS, INCLUDING STOMACH CANCER, LEUKEMIA, AND LYMPHOMA.

THE EVENT OF LYMPHOMA WAS INITIALLY REPORTED VIA (B)(4) ON (B)(4) 2012. DEVICE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, ASYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS DEFLATE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. DEFLATION CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO DEFLATE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS; FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL; EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (EG DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED); TRAUMA; COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING; AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF DEFLATION FOR ALLERGAN'S PROD; HOWEVER, IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF DEFLATION. PUBLISHED STUDIES INDICATE THAT BREAST CANCER IS NO MORE COMMON IN WOMAN WITH IMPLANTS THAN THOSE WITHOUT IMPLANTS.

IN ADDITION, ALLERGAN HAS INITIATED A SEPARATE LARGE 10-YEAR POSTAPPROVAL STUDY (BREAST IMPLANT F/U STUDIES, OR BIFS) TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC ISSUES WHICH ALLERGAN'S CORE STUDY WAS NOT DESIGNED TO FULLY ANSWER, AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE A REAL-WORLD ASSESSMENT OF SOME ENDPOINTS. THE ENDPOINTS IN THE BIFS LARGE POSTAPPROVAL STUDY INCLUDE LONG-TERM LOCAL COMPLICATIONS, CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE (CTD), CTD SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS, NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE, NEUROLOGICAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS, OFFSPRING ISSUES, REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES, CANCER SUICIDE, MAMMOGRAPHY ISSUES, AND MRI COMPLIANCE AND RESULTS. ALLERGAN WILL UPDATE THEIR LABELING ON A REGULAR BASIS WITH THE RESULTS OF THESE TWO STUDIES. THERE WAS 1 PRIMARY AUGMENTATION PT WITH A NEW DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER THROUGH 7 YEARS IN THE CORE STUDY. THERE WAS A 13% BENIGN BREAST DISEASE RATE AND 1% MALIGNANT BREAST DISEASE RATE. FOR REVISION-AUGMENTATION PTS, THERE WAS 1 PT WITH A NEW DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER. THER WAS A 15% BENIGN BREAST DISEASE RATE AND A 1% MALIGNANT BREAST DISEASE RATE THROUGH 7 YEARS. IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION PTS THERE WAS 1 REPORT OF THYROID CANCER AND 1 REPORT OF BRAIN CANCER. THERE WERE NO REPORTS OF OTHER CANCERS, SUCH AS RESPIRATORY OR CERVICAL/VULVAR, IN REVISION-AUGMENTATION PTS. THERE WERE 8 PRIMARY RECONSTRUCTION PTS (8%) WITH NEW REPORTS OF BREAST CANCER THROUGH 7 YEARS IN THE CORE STUDY. THERE WAS A 17% BENIGN BREAST DISEASE RATE AND A 10% MALIGNANT BREAST DISEASE RATE THROUGH 7 YEARS. FOR REVISION RECONSTRUCTION PTS, THERE WERE NO REPORTS OF NEW DIAGNOSES OR REOCCURRENCE OF BREAST CANCER. THERE WAS A 7% BENIGN BREAST DISEASE RATE THROUGH 7 YEARS.

5155756|28464643|N|0||DEVICE LABELING: PUBLISHED STUDIES INDICATE THAT BREAST CANCER IS NO MORE COMMON IN WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS THAN THOSE WITHOUT IMPLANTS. A LARGE, LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP FOUND NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE RISK RATES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CANCERS, INCLUDING STOMACH CANCER, LEUKEMIA, AND LYMPHOMA. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, ASYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. DEFLATION Â¿ BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS DEFLATE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. DEFLATION CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO DEFLATE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS; FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL; EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED); TRAUMA; COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING; AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF DEFLATION FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT; HOWEVER, IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF DEFLATION.|STYLE 168 SALINE FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|168-420|10/16/2015||||N|R||0HP|FWM|1.0|05/01/1996|PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||2-163072|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA.

BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. IN THE PASS STUDY, AT LEAST 1 REOPERATION WAS PERFORMED ON 315 PATIENTS (36.5%) THROUGH 10 YEARS. A TOTAL OF 424 REOPERATIONS WERE PERFORMED. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR REOPERATION THROUGH 10 YEARS ON AUGMENTATION PATIENTS WAS IMPLANT DEFLATION AT 21.7%. THE PERCENTAGE OF REOPERATIONS DUE TO LUMP/MASS/CYST INCREASED FROM 8.5% OF 293 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 5 YEARS TO 13.9% OF 424 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 10 YEARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF LUMPS, MASSES, AND CYSTS CAN BE EXPECTED TO NATURALLY INCREASE AS PATIENTS AGE AND COULD BE AN EXPLANATION FOR THE INCREASE. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, ASYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. OF THE 237 PATIENTS IN THE R95 STUDY, AT LEAST 1 REOPERATION WAS PERFORMED ON 99 PATIENTS (42%) FOR A TOTAL OF 125 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 5 YEARS. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR REOPERATION THROUGH 5 YEARS WAS CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE AT 25.6%. OF THE 237 RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS IN R95, THERE WERE 62 PATIENTS (26.2%) WHO HAD 70 IMPLANTS REMOVED THROUGH 5 YEARS. OF THE 70 RECONSTRUCTION IMPLANTS REMOVED THROUGH 5 YEARS, 70% WERE REPLACED. THE MOST COMMON REASON FOR IMPLANT REMOVAL WAS CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE (31.4%). THROUGH 10 YEARS, THERE WERE 104 IMPLANTS REMOVED FROM 85 PATIENTS.

CALCIUM DEPOSITS CAN FORM IN THE TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT WITH SYMPTOMS THAT MAY INCLUDE PAIN AND FIRMNESS. LYMPHADENOPATHY HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED IN SOME WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS. BASED ON INFO REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGAN'S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERS' BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MUFTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. USE CARE IN SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURES SUCH AS OPEN CAPSULOTOMY, BREAST POCKET REVISION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA ASPIRATION, AND BIOPSY/LUMPECTOMY TO AVOID DAMAGE TO THE IMPLANT SHELL OR VALVE. ANY POSTOPERATIVE EVACUATION OF HEMATOMA OR SEROMA MUST BE CONDUCTED WITH CARE TO AVOID BREAST IMPLANT CONTAMINATION, OR DAMAGE FROM SHARP INSTRUMENTS. THE USE OF MICROWAVE DIATHERMY IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST IMPLANTS IS NOT RECOMMENDED, AS IT HAS BEEN REPORTED TO CAUSE TISSUE NECROSIS, SKIN EROSION, AND EXTRUSION OF THE IMPLANT. ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE IN VIVO EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. PATIENTS SHOULD BE INFORMED THAT DISSATISFACTION WITH COSMETIC RESULTS RELATED TO SUCH THINGS AS SCAR DEFORMITY, HYPERTROPHIC SCARRING, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, INCORRECT SIZE, AND IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY MAY OCCUR. CAREFUL SURGICAL PLANNING AND TECHNIQUE CAN MINIMIZE, BUT NOT PRECLUDE, THE RISK OF SUCH RESULTS. PRE-EXISTING ASYMMETRY MAY NOT BE ENTIRELY CORRECTABLE. REVISION SURGERY MAY BE INDICATED TO MAINTAIN PATIENT SATISFACTION BUT CARRIES ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS AND RISKS.

THE ABSTRACT OF THIS ARTICLE WAS FIRST RECEIVED ON 11/09/2016. THIS EVENT WAS FIRST RECEIVED IN THE ABSTRACT. FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE AUTHOR REGARDING EVENT, PRODUCT, OR PATIENT DETAILS HAS BEEN REQUESTED. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. DEVICE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. BREAST IMPLANTS RUPTURE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. RUPTURES CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO RUPTURE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, STRESSING THE IMPLANT DURING IMPLANTATION AND WEAKENING IT, FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL, EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED), TRAUMA, COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING, AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF RUPTURE FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT. IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF RUPTURE. LABORATORY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RUPTURE ARE ONGOING. SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE. IF RUPTURE OCCURS, SILICONE GEL MAY EITHER REMAIN WITHIN THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), MOVE OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE (EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), OR MOVE OUTSIDE THE BREAST (GEL MIGRATION).

BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. BREAST IMPLANTS RUPTURE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. RUPTURES CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO RUPTURE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, STRESSING THE IMPLANT DURING IMPLANTATION AND WEAKENING IT, FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL, EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED), TRAUMA, COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING, AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF RUPTURE FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT. IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF RUPTURE. LABORATORY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RUPTURE ARE ONGOING. SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SEE TABLE 4 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING MRI SCREENING. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE. IF RUPTURE OCCURS, SILICONE GEL MAY EITHER REMAIN WITHIN THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), MOVE OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE (EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), OR MOVE OUTSIDE THE BREAST (GEL MIGRATION).

IT WAS REPORTED THAT A (B)(6) YEAR-OLD WOMAN WITH MASTECTOMY AND AXILLARY DISSECTION (2004) FOR LYMPH NODE-FREE LOBULAR CARCINOMA OF HER RIGHT BREAST WAS IN COMPLETE REMISSION FOR 11 YEARS. SHE UNDERWENT RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY WITH BILATERAL ALLERGAN IMPLANTS IN 2005, REPLACED BY MENTOR IMPLANTS IN 2008. A MODERATELY-LARGE LEFT PERI-PROSTHETIC EFFUSION SEEN BY MRI IN 2012 CONTAINED NON-ATYPICAL LYMPHOCYTES AND MACROPHAGES IN A PROTEINACEOUS BACKGROUND, AND WAS CYTOLOGICALLY INTERPRETED AS A SEROMA. SHE HAD TWO OTHER SEROMAS OF HER RIGHT BREAST (2013) THAT SPONTANEOUSLY REGRESSED WITHOUT EVACUATION. ON (B)(6) 2015, SHE COMPLAINED OF PAIN AND SWELLING OF HER RIGHT BREAST. A LARGE PERI-IMPLANT EFFUSION SUSPICIOUS OF AN INFLAMMATORY PROCESS BY ULTRASOUND WAS COMPLETELY DRAINED BY FNA, RECOVERING 85 CC OF CLOUDY YELLOW FLUID. BILATERAL IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED. SHE IS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING A WAIT-AND-SEE STRATEGY AND IS ALIVE WITHOUT DISEASE 8 MONTHS AFTER HER LYMPHOMA DIAGNOSIS.

FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE AUTHOR REGARDING EVENT, PRODUCT, OR PATIENT DETAILS HAS BEEN REQUESTED. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. DEVICE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. BREAST IMPLANTS RUPTURE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. RUPTURES CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO RUPTURE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, STRESSING THE IMPLANT DURING IMPLANTATION AND WEAKENING IT, FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL, EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED), TRAUMA, COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING, AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF RUPTURE FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT. IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF RUPTURE. LABORATORY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RUPTURE ARE ONGOING. SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SEE TABLE 4 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING MRI SCREENING. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE. IF RUPTURE OCCURS, SILICONE GEL MAY EITHER REMAIN WITHIN THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), MOVE OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE (EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), OR MOVE OUTSIDE THE BREAST (GEL MIGRATION). THERE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY THAT RUPTURE MAY PROGRESS FROM INTRACAPSULAR TO EXTRACAPSULAR AND BEYOND."|STYLE 153 SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|UNK STYLE 153|12/02/2016||||*|*||0HP|FTR|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||NI|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. BREAST IMPLANTS RUPTURE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. RUPTURES CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO RUPTURE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, STRESSING THE IMPLANT DURING IMPLANTATION AND WEAKENING IT, FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL, EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED), TRAUMA, COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING, AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF RUPTURE FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT. IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF RUPTURE. LABORATORY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RUPTURE ARE ONGOING. SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SEE TABLE 4 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING MRI SCREENING. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE. IF RUPTURE OCCURS, SILICONE GEL MAY EITHER REMAIN WITHIN THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), MOVE OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE (EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), OR MOVE OUTSIDE THE BREAST (GEL MIGRATION).
