11618|7262|D|1||RPTR'S PAIN IS LOCATED BELOW THE LEFT BREAST IN THE AREA OF A PREVIOUS BREAST AUGMENTATION SCAR. THE PAIN BEGAN ABOUT 12 YRS AGO, WHICH WAS TWO YRS AFTER BILATERAL BREAST AUGMENTATION SURGERY. THIS PAIN IS INTERMITTENT IN NATURE. SHE WILL GO A COUPLE OF YRS WITHOUT HAVING ANY PAIN AND IT NEVER LASTS MORE THAN 20 MINS. SHE DESCRIBES THE PAIN AS VERY SHARP, LOCATED IN THE AREA OF THIS SCAR AND SOMETIMES SHE NOTICES SOME KIND OF A TINGLING FEELING. THE PAIN INTENSITY IS ANYWHERE FROM A SCALE OF 1-10, SOMETIMES THE PAIN IS SO SEVERE SHE STATES THAT IT BRINGS HER TO HER KNEES. SOMETIMES JUST STIMULATION OF SKIN OVER HER POSTERIOR BACK INCREASES THE PAIN OVER THE SCAR. THE PAIN IS AGGRAVATED BY MOBILITY. ROLLING OVER IN BED AGGRAVATES THE PAIN. WHEN THE PAIN IS PRESENT BREATHING OR COUGHING MAKES THE PAIN WORSE. NO POSITIONS OR HEAT OR COLD HELP THE PAIN. SHE HAS BEEN ON NUMEROUS MEDICATIONS INCLUDING NONSTEROIDALS, MOTRIN AND TOLECTIN, THAT HAVE BEEN NO HELP WHATSOEVER. SHE HAD BEEN ON PAMELOR AND TEGRETOL WHICH ALSO HAVE BEEN NO HELP. THE ONLY MEDICATION THAT HAS GIVEN HER ANY HELP IS HYDROCODONE 5 MG QID. SHE STILL HAS THE PAIN WHILE ON THIS MEDICATION BUT IT SORT OF DULLS THE INTENSITY. HER CURRENT MEDICATIONS INCLUDE LIBRIUM 10 MG TID AND SHE IS ON HORMONE REPLACEMENT. THE PLASTIC SURGEON WHO DID THE INTITIAL SURGERY, HAS BEEN SEEING HER FOR THIS PROBLEM AND HAS INJECTED SCAR NUMEROUS TIMES WITH STEROIDS AND HAS DONE INTERCOSTAL BLOCKS. THE INTERCOASTAL BLOCKS SEEM TO HAVE BEEN INEFFECTIVE IN THAT THERE WAS NO NUMBNESS IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE INTERCOSTAL NERVE. BECAUSE OF HER HEALTH INSURANCE THE PLASTIC SURGEON HAD TO DO THESE BLOCKS BEFORE HE COULD RE-OPERATE ON HER. IN 10/91 HE RE-OPERATED ON HER AND FOUND THAT SHE HAD SILICONE LEAKS FROM THE BREAST IMPLANTS AND CAPSULITIS AND HAD SIGNS OF NERVE ENTRAPMENT. HE FIXED ALL THESE PROBLEMS, CLEARED OUT SCAR TISSUE AND PUT IN NEW BREAST IMPLANTS, THIS TIME BELOW THE PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE. SHE HAD NOTICED THAT THE PAIN HAS BEEN NO DIFFERENT SINCE THIS PARTICULAR OPERATION. AN ANESTHESIOLOGIST DID INTERCOASTAL BLOCK ON 7/22/92. SHE HAD NUMBNESS IN THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE NERVE BLOCKS WHICH WERE T6 THROUGH T9 ON THE LEFT, HOWEVER THE PAIN WAS NOT RELIEVED. THE PT STATES THAT THIS PAIN IS CAUSING HER A LOT OF STRESS. RECENTLY SHE HAS BEEN HAVING INCREASED INCIDENTS OF THESE PAINFUL EPISODES THAT SHE THINKS ARE RELATED TO STRESS. EXAM OF HER CHEST WALL REVEALS THE SCAR IS WELL-HEALED. IT IS VERY FLAT, THERE IS NO TENDERNESS ON PALPATION OF THE SCAR. NO SIGNS OF NEUROMAS. PT NOTES THAT THE PAIN WENT COMPLETELY AWAY FOR 7 MONTHS AFTER A TRIAL OF DILANTIN BUT SHE HAD A REACTION OT THE MEDICATION AND COULD NOT CONTINUE IT. DR WAS UNABLE TO REPRODUCE THE PT'S PAIN WITH DEEP PRESSURE, SUPERFICIAL PRESSURE, STROKING OR BRUSHING. HOWEVER, DR COULD REPRODUCE THE PAIN WITH TENS OVER RPTR'S INTERCOSTAL AREA, BOTH ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR. PHYSICAL THERAPY IMPRESSION IS INTERCOSTAL NEURALGIA.
