BREAST PROBLEMS ANYMORE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IT TURNED OUT TO BE A GREAT DISASTER RPTR HAD 18 SURGERIES PROSTHESIS INOUT INOUT TRANSPLANTATION OF OWN TISSUE WITHOUT SUCCESS ANOTHER RECONSTRUCTION-TRY PROSTHESIS INOUT ETC WITHIN 3 YEARS RPTR GOT RHEUMATISM RA DIAGNOSED WAS FORCED TO MOVE INTO A SPECIAL HOUSE FOR DISABLED PEOPLE AND A LOT OF OTHER DISEASES WHICH DIDNT FIT THEM AT ALL THEIR BODY TOLD ANOTHER TALE SO EVERYTHING WAS ALL IN THEIR MIND IN 1990 A RUPTURED IMPLANT WAS REMOVED AND A VERY SAFE THICK ONE RE-IMPLANTED SPECIALIST ASSURED RPTR THAT THIS NEW DEVICE DIDNT CAUSE PROBLEMS RPTR RECOVERED COULD WALK WITHOUT PAIN MIRACLE ALAS ONLY FOR 2 MOS THE NEW LOW BLEED IMPLANT STARTED TO POISON RPTRS BODY AGAIN AND MADE THEM SICK AS NEVER BEFORE RPTR WAS COMPLETELY DISABLED AND HELPLESS THE ONLY WAY TO SURVIVE WAS A RADICAL EXPLANTATION OF THIS SICK-MAKER A VERY HARD DECISION DURING THAT TIME RPTR LAID HANDS ON AN INTERESTING MEDICAL REPORT PUBLICIZED IN 1987 ABOUT THE POSSIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN SILICONE AND IMMUNE DISORDERS LIKE RHEUMATISM NAMED HAD ILUMAN ADJUVANT DISEASE RPTR COULD NOT AND STILL CANNOT FIND WORDS TO EXPRESS THEIR FEELINGS OF ANGER AND BETRAYAL ALL THOSE LOST YEARS ALL THIS PAIN SCARS DESPAIR NOT ONLY FOR THEMSELF ALSO FOR THEIR SPOUSE AND CHILDREN BEFORE RPTR REALIZED IT THEY WERE THE HEAD OF A FAST GROWING SUPPORT GROUP FOR WOMEN WITH SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS OFFICIALLY REGISTERED BY LAW 5792 RPTRS BODY LOOKED AWFUL ONE BREAST WAS COMPLETELY GONE SINCE RPTR STARTED THEIR CRUSADE THEY HAVE HEARD THE VERY SAME STORY OVER 4000 TIMES THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR RPTR CONTACTED OTHER GROUPS AROUND THE WORLD ONLY THE TONGUE WAS DIFFERENT THE TALE THE VERY SAME RPTR ALSO WROTE OR PHONED TO DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES ALL OVER THE WORLD TO INFORM THEMSELF AS WELL AS POSSIBLE PLASTIC SURGEONS HARDLY INFORM THE WOMEN ABOUT POSSIBLE FUTURE HEALTH RISKS BOTH TO THEMSELVES AND THEIR YET UNBORN BABIES THEY ONLY SHOW NICE PICTURES SILICONE IS AN INERT MATERIAL NO DANGER AT ALL THE WORLDWIDE COMMOTION IS GOSSIP FROM HYSTERICAL WOMEN OUT FOR MONEY NOTHING SCIENTIFIC PROVEN NO LINK IS FOUND TILL NOW AS LONG AS IT ISNT BANNED I GO ON IS THEIR FAVORITE SLOGAN IT IS POSSIBLE HERE TO BUY YOUR BREASTS NOW AND PAY MONTHLY YOU CAN READ THAT IN ALL ADS IN ALL NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES I THINK THAT IS A VERY HYPOCRITICAL WAY TO TRANSLATE THE OATH OF HYPOCRATIS THE MAMMON ABOVE THE HUMAN BEINGS SINCE THE START OF SUPPORT GROUP IN 1992 TILL NOW RPTR HAS ANSWERED OVER 20000 TELEPHONE-CALLS FROM 5 MINS TO 1 12 HRS OR EVEN MORE AND HEARD MORE THAN 4000 TIMES THE VERY SAME STORY SOMETIMES ANONYMOUS THEY ALL RECEIVED INFORMATION-PACKET TO HELP THEM TO FIND THEIR WAY GROUP ALSO SENT THE WOMEN DIFFERENT QUESTIONNAIRES FOR MORE INVESTIGATION THE FIRST ONE WITH ABOUT 100 ANSWER POSSIBILITIES AGE OF THE WOMEN BETWEEN 17-78 YEARS AGE OF IMPLANTS ONE MONTH-35 YEARS THE RESULTS WERE SHOCKING BUT NOT SCIENTIFIC THAT CAME LATER THANKS TO THE UNIVERSITY WHO ANALYZED ALL RESULTS THE MOST SHOCKING PART THE ANSWERS FROM MOTHERS WITH CHILDREN BEFORE AND AFTER THEIR IMPLANTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE KIDS AND THEIR MEDICAL COMPLAINTS OVER 199 CHILDREN ARE REGISTERED FINDINGS WERE THE VERY SAME AS WRITTEN IN A CHILDREN HOSPITAL REPORT 1993 83 OF THE WOMEN WHO CONTACTED SUPPORT GROUP DID HAVE MANY OF THE WELL-KNOWN DISEASES THAT IS OVER 10 OF THE VALUED 30000 WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS IN RTPRS COUNTRY 14 WANTED INFO ABOUT AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION 2 DID NOT YET HAVE PROBLEMS 1 WAS SUFFERING DUE TO OTHER MEDICAL DEVICES LIKE HIPS TESTICLES INJECTIONS NEEDLES ETC OF THOSE 83 IS THE SCORE 99 WITH MUSCLEJOINT PAINS OFTEN FALSELY DIAGNOSED AS RA OR FIBROMYALGIA CHRONIC FATIGUE 98 MEMORY LOSS SHORT MEMORY AND BAD CONCENTRATION 93 MOST OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS 1487 ALL DOCUMENTED SCORED HIGHER THAN 70 BY EXPLANATION OVER 80 OF THE IMPLANTS WERE RUPTURED OR VISIBLY LEAKINGBLEEDING THAT IS WHAT THE WOMEN TOLD RPTR BUT MOSTLY NOT WRITTEN IN THEIR FILES NOR REGISTERED 40 OF THE EXPLANTED WOMEN RECOVERED QUITE A LOT WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR ABOUT 45 NEEDED 2 TO 5 YEARS TO FEEL BETTER THE OTHERS ALAS HAVE PASSED THE WAY OF NO RETURN NO IDEA HOW LONG THEYLL STAY AMONG THEM 15-20 LADIES ARE TERRIBLY SICK GOING DOWN HILL DAILY SOME ARE TERMINAL BY NOW 7 TIMES THEY FOUND A TUMOR TOO LATE AS FAR AS RPTR HAS HEARD 16 LADIES ALREADY DIED WITHOUT KNOWING WHY FIVE OF THEM RPTR KNEW VERY WELL ALMOST TILL THE VERY LAST MINUTE ONE COMMITTED SUICIDE 34 YEARS OLD THEY COULD NOT STAND THE PAIN ANYMORE AND THEIR MAIMED BODY BUT MOST OF THE IMPLANTS WERE RUPTURED ENVELOPE GONE OR THERE WAS VISIBLE BLEEDING THERE ARE ALSO 2 BABIES RPTR KNOWS ABOUT ONE CHOKED IN MUCUS AFTER BEING BREASTFED ONLY 6 WEEKS OLD THE OTHER ONE BLED TO DEATH 2 WEEKS BEFORE BIRTH NO REASON FOUND ONLY A STRANGE DISORDER IN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM HEALTH GOVERNMENT DOESNT TAKE ALL COMPLAINTS SERIOUSLY THEY DONT REALIZE THE REALITY IS EVEN MORE THAN WORSE THEY HARDLY LISTEN TO RPTR THEY EVEN DONT BELIEVE RPTR AND DO NOTHING FOR THE SICK WOMEN CHILDREN AND MEN NO MEDICATION NO TREATMENT NO HELP AT ALL FOR THIS BETRAYED POPULATION RPTR THINKS ALL THEIR HEALTH

885245|19252514|D|1||I RECEIVED THE SILICON GUMMY BEAR BREAST IMPLANTS IN 2005 THE FIRST PROBLEM THAT NO ONE HAD ADVISED ME ABOUT IS THAT UPON WAKING UP FROM SURGERY AND FROM THEN ON THERE IS A REAL REDUCTION OF THE MUSCLES IN MY ARMS GIVING A MUCH WEAKER ARMS MOBILITY AND CONTROL AFFECTING DRIVING LIFTING ETC THEN AT ABOUT FOUR WEEKS LATER AFTER THE SURGERY I STARTED TO HAVE STRONG SHOOTING PAIN IN MY WRISTS AND FEET AND KNEES I FELT OFTEN TIRED AND ALSO GOT SICK EASILY I STARTED TO GET OUT OF BED USING KNUCKLES AND CLOSED FIST TO PUSH UP -TO REDUCE THE PAIN- AS TO AVOID PUTTING PRESSURE ON MY PAINFUL WRISTS THEN IT STARTED TO BE A PROBLEM TO WORK OUT AT THE GYM BECAUSE OF THE PAIN IN THE BOWL OF THE FOOT AND TO STAY IN CLASS FOR LONG HOURS I WAS WORKING AS A TEACHER IN 2006 I STARTED TO HAVE ASTHMA THAT WAS VERY DISTURBING AT NIGHT THEN COUGH AND APNEA EPISODES AND HAD TO TAKE TIME OFF WORK AND MORE MEDICAL EXPENSES AT ABOUT ONE MONTH LATER I HAD A STAPH INFECTION ON MY NECK THAT REQUIRED A SHOT AT THE EMERGENCY ROOM BECAUSE I HAD CHEST PRESSURE AND COULDNT BREATHE WELL THE STAPH SKIN INFECTION TOOK TWO ROUNDS OF ANTIBIOTICS TO CLEAR SINCE 2005 I ALSO EXPERIENCED RASHES ON MY CHESTS THAT I NEVER HAD BEFORE THE RED PATCHES-RASHES HAVE DIFFERENT SHAPES SOMETIMES GEOMETRIC SOMETIMES THE SIZE OF A SNAIL AND THEY COME AND GO WITHIN TWO TO FIVE DAYS AND I WEAR NECK HIGH SHIRTS MAKING IT VERY UNCOMFORTABLE IN THIS HEAT I ALSO NOTICED A DRAMATIC CHANGE IN THE SHAPE AND COLOR OF THE MOLES ON MY SKIN -MIGRATION DARKER- AND MY SKIN SENSITIVITY WITH SOME PARTS OF MY SKIN FEELING NUMB OR LESS SENSITIVE AROUND MY CHEST AND ARMS THE DERMATOLOGIST I CONSULTED DIDNT IDENTIFY THEM WITH A PARTICULAR TREATMENT BUT TRIED TO SELL ME SEVERAL LASER REJUVENATING TREATMENTS EACH DOCTOR I CONSULTED IN THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF TOLD ME THAT MY SYMPTOMS WERE UNLIKELY RELATED TO THE SILICON IMPLANTS BECAUSE THE FDA REPORTED THEM SAFE AND THERE WOULD BE NO FURTHER QUESTION ABOUT IT I CONSULTED MANY DOCTORS AND RAN MANY BLOOD AND URINE TESTS HIPS AND HANDS X-RAYS IMPLANTS X-RAYS CHIROPRACTOR SESSIONS ACUPUNCTURE AYURVEDIC -OUT OF FRUSTRATION- BUT NOTHING HAS RELIEVED ME FROM THE SHOOTING PAIN THE BLOOD TESTS RESULTS DIDNT SHOW ANY INFLAMMATION IN MY SYSTEM PAIN COMES AND GOES AND ACUPUNCTURE HELPS ONLY FOR A SHORT TIME AT NIGHT I WAKE UP COMPLETE AWAKE SOMETIMES AT 2AM OR 4AM AND CANNOT GO BACK TO SLEEP AND USE THE RESTROOM SEVERAL TIMES AT NIGHT UNABLE TO GET A COMPLETE EMPTYING FEELING WITH A SLOW FLOW WHICH IS ALSO SOMETHING I NEVER DEALT WITH BEFORE I HAVE SHOOTING PAIN IN MY KNEES AND HIPS AND SOMETIMES SMALL BONES TOES AS IF A METAL PIN WAS SHOVED WITH FORCE I HAVE CONSULTED A LOCAL SURGEON ABOUT ONE MONTH LATER WHO TOLD ME THAT HED HELP ME REMOVE THE IMPLANTS BUT I DONT HAVE THE RESOURCE TO PAY FOR SURGERY THE NEW SURGEON I CONSULTED RECENTLY SAID THAT HE PERFORMED ALREADY ABOUT 300 EXPLANTATIONS EN BLOC AND THAT THE WOMEN PRESENTED HEALTH COMPLAINTS SIMILAR TO MINE WITH 23 SUCCESS RATE OF HEALTH REVERSAL TO COMPLETE GOOD HEALTH AS THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY TO THE IMPLANTS INSERTION AT AN URGENT CARE AT ONE VERY PAINFUL EVENT I WAS PRESCRIBED PAIN KILLERS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS AS THERE ARE NO TESTS FOR MIGRATING SILICON I HAVE NOT TAKEN THE ANTIDEPRESSANTS AS IT IS NOT GOING TO ALLEVIATE THE PAIN IN MY JOINTS GIVING MY SIGHT BACK ALLEVIATE MY FINGER BONES PAIN AND NUMBNESS OR GIVE ME MY HEALTH AND STRENGTH BACK SINCE 2007 THINGS SEEM TO HAVE PRECIPITATED WITH MY HEALTH ADDING TO THE PREVIOUS PROBLEMS BECAUSE I WAS ALWAYS FEELING SO TIRED AND NOT GETTING ENOUGH REST AND WAKING UP AT NIGHT I DECIDED TO LEAVE MY TEACHING POSITION AND WORK FROM HOME AND HAVE A SLOWER PACE AND GET MORE REST WHEN I NEED IT I HAVE NEW SYMPTOMS SINCE 2007 AS FOLLOW MY FINGER TIPS ARE NUMB AND I HAVE CHEST PAIN WHEN I BREATHE ESPECIALLY WHEN I AM LAYING IN BED AND MY LOWER LEGS AND TOES GET NUMB WHICH MAKE ME WANT TO MOVE AROUND AND CHANGE POSITION AS TO HELP MY BODY BLOOD CIRCULATION I HAVE NEW BURNING SENSATION PATCHES ON MY ARMS THAT ALSO SEEM TO COME AND GO WHEN I TAKE A DEEP BREATH MY BACKBONE EXTENDS AND MAKES A LOUD POPPING SOUND ITS QUIET SCARY ESPECIALLY WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING I HAVE SORES IN MY MOUTHS THAT COME AND GO BETWEEN TWO MONTHS IN 2007 AND NOW MY VISION IS SUDDENLY BLURRY I CANNOT READ WELL REGULAR PRINT CLOSE OR DISTANT ITS REALLY SCARY ALTHOUGH THE SCARIEST PART IS THAT MY SKELETON IS PERFORMING DIFFERENTLY THE JOINTS IN HIPS AND KNEES HANDS FINGERS AND TOES STARTED ACTING UP BUT IN THE LAST FOUR MONTHS IT PRECIPITATED TO ALL THE OTHER ONES WITH A LOUD POPPING SOUND IN MY BACK ESPECIALLY MANDIBLE SHOULDERS AND THE NECK -MAKES A WHOOSHING SOUND- I HAVE PUT ON 15 POUNDS SINCE RECEIVING THE IMPLANTS AND I AM UNABLE TO GO THE GYM AS I USED TO OR TO RUN ANY LONGER BECAUSE OF PAIN IN FEET TOES AND KNEES LOOKING BACK AT THIS ONE YEAR AND A HALF I HAVE SPENT 35-45 OF MY WORKING TIME MEETING DOCTORS MANAGING THE SHOOTING PAIN DOING REPETITIVE AND INCONCLUSIVE LAB TESTS TAKING LONG NAPS DEALING WITH SLEEP INTERRUPTION AND URINE AND KIDNEY TRACK PROBLEM SOLVING AND SEARCHING FOR FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO FIND

2163607|2106125|D|1||IM WRITING MY STORY TO THE FDA THIS IS ABOUT MY BREAST SILICONE IMPLANTS THAT HAVE BEEN BLEEDING OUT FOR 7 OR MORE YEARS I STARTED TO CONTINUALLY TO BE SICK WITH SYMPTOMS LIKE LOW GRADE FEVERS 996 TO 1008 ALL THE TIME FATIGUE SWOLLEN LYMPH NODES FLU-LIKE SYMPTOMS NIGHT SWEATS INSOMNIA BACKACHES WEIGHT LOSS WEIGHT GAIN BONES HURTING CANKER SORES IN MY MOUTH FOR 4 MONTHS AND ON AND OFF FOR 2 YEARS LARGE SUB LINGUAL TONSILS COUGHING WEAKNESS SHORTNESS OF BREATH CHEST PAINS PAIN DEEP IN THE BONES MEMORY LOSS UNTIL B6 2007 WHEN MY BLOOD PRESSURE WENT UP AND I STARTED GETTING CHEST PAINS THEN I SAW MY CARDIOLOGIST HE RAN ALL THE TESTS ECHO THALLIUM TREADMILL AND BP MONITOR WITH BLOOD TESTS ALL THE TESTS CAME BACK NEGATIVE EXCEPT FOR MY CRP IT WAS 206 THIS HAD MY CARDIOLOGIST CONCERNED HE ASKED THAT I RETURNED IN 2 MONTHS FOR A REPEAT TEST TO SEE IF IT WAS STILL HIGH 201 IN B6 THE TEST WAS REPEATED WITH THE SAME RESULT 201 SENT ME FOR A CHEST CT SCAN CAME BACK ABNORMAL AGAIN MY CT SHOWED MANY SPOTS WITH INFILTRATES IN BOTH LUNGS AND PATCHY SPOTS WITH ABNORMAL LYMPH NODES HE REFERRED ME TO A PULMONOLOGIST SHE SAID I NEED A LYMPH NODE BIOPSY IN MY AXILLARYS NODES WANTED TO RO LYMPHOMA SHE HAD MORE BLOOD TEST DONE AND MY CPR WAS UP TO 43 AND SED RATE WAS UP WBC WAS UP BLOOD WORK IS STARTING TO COME BACK ABNORMAL SHE REFERRED ME TO A GENERAL SURGEON TO PERFORM THE BIOPSY AND THE BIOPSY CAME BACK SHOWING SILICONE IN THE LYMPH NODES AND ALSO IN MY MEDIA-STERNUM FROM THE LAST BIOPSY THE DOCTORS ARE NOW SAYING THIS HAS BEEN LEAKING INTO SYSTEM SLOWLY SINCE BEFORE 2004 AND MY AUTOIMMUNE SYSTEM HAS BEEN FIGHTING WHICH IS WHY I HAVE BEEN SO SICK WELL THE 1ST SURGERY WAS ON B6 2007 THE INCISIONS ARE ABOUT 3IN ON BOTH SIDE OF MY PELVIC AREA THIS SURGERY WILL BE DIVIDING THE INFERIOR EPIGASTRIC BLOOD VESSELS TRAINING THE TRAM TISSUES TO RELY ON THE SUPERIOR EPIGASTRIC SYSTEM THIS STEP IS NOT REQUIRED FOR SUCCESSFUL PEDICLE TRAM RECONSTRUCTION BUT CAN IMPROVE BLOOD SUPPLY TO THE FLAP SO-CALLED DELAY PROCEDURES MAY EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY OF PERFORMING MICROSURGERY SUPERCHARGING IF THE PEDICLE FLAP HAS ANY ARTERIAL OR VENOUS INSUFFICIENCY PROBLEMS SINCE THE VESSELS DIVIDED IN THE DELAY CANNOT BE USED IT IS INFECTING MY LUNGS AND IMMUNE SYSTEM AND OTHER MAJOR ORGANS IN ALL I HAD A MINIMUM OF 13 MAJOR SURGERIES WHICH INCLUDE MORE RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY AND WOUND CARE DEVELOP NECROSIS FROM THE SURGERY ALL THE SILICONE COULD NOT BE REMOVED I HAD DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH AND THERE IS VERY LITTLE ABOUT MY CONDITION AND SILICONE ILLNESS BOTH THE SURGEON AND PLASTIC SURGEON HAVE SAID THIS IS A VERY RARE CONDITION ON B6 2007 BILATERAL PEDICLES TRAM FLAP WITH THE REMOVAL OF SILICONE IMPLANTS BOTH IMPLANTS WERE RUPTURED AND BLEEDING OUT MORE ON THE LEFT THEN ON THE RIGHT SIDE BUT THE PLASTIC SURGEON -PS- SAID THESE HAVE BEEN LEAKING FOR A LONG TIME THE PS CLEANED ALL THE AREA WHILE NOT TO DISTURB THE BLOOD VESSEL FOR THE TRAM FLAPS THE PS USED THE SKIN OF THE BREASTS FROM WHERE HE REMOVED THE IMPLANTS AND TRANSPLANTED THE FLAPS BILATERALLY TO KEEP ME THE SAME SIZE AND SYMMETRICALLY THE ABDOMEN REPAIR TUMMY TUCK THERE HAS BEEN SOME BRUISING AROUND THE NEW PLACEMENT OF THE BELLY BUTTON AND ABDOMEN AROUND THERE THE PS USED MESH FOR MY ABDOMEN INSTEAD OF ALLODERM BECAUSE THE MESH WAS STRONGER I CAN FEEL THAT MESH WHEN I WALK I WAS IN SURGERY FOR 8 12 HOURS AND SUFFERED RESPIRATORY FAILURE WITH PULMONARY EDEMA WITHIN THE FIRST 24 HOURS I WAS MOVED TO THE FLOOR AND DEVELOPED PNEUMONIA IN THE RIGHT LOWER LOBE I SWEAR I WAS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT BASED ON BREATHING ANTIBIOTICS PUSH AND LASIX PUSH AND PLENTY OF RESPIRATORY THERAPY WHEN I GOT HOME I HAD EXTRA EQUIPMENT OXYGEN WALKER AND HOSPITAL BED I WAS ON A LOT OF ANTIBIOTICS AND PAIN PILLS I WENT TO THE DOCTOR AND IT LOOKS LIKE IM GOING TO BE ADMITTED BACK INTO THE HOSPITAL ON B6 2008 FOR MORE SURGERY FOR A WOUND THAT DEVELOPED IN THE ABDOMEN THE SURGERY IS FOR DEBRIDEMENT OF THE WOUND THAT IS NOT HEALING AND PLACING A WOUND VAC ON IT THE DOCTOR WILL HAVE TO REDO 8 INCHES OF THE INCISION I WILL BE IN THE HOSPITAL FOR 2-3 DAYS I WILL HAVE TO PRAY MORE THE SURGERY IS SUPPOSED TO TAKE 1 TO 1 12 HOUR WITH THE COMPLICATIONS OF MY LUNGS THAT TIME SHOULDNT BE TOO BAD I WAS AFRAID OF DEVELOPING INFECTION B6 THEN 6 WEEKS OF THE WOUND VAC ON MY ABDOMEN I DID DEVELOP B6 AND WAS HOSPITALIZE FOR 4 MONTHS IN 2008 I HAVE STARTED TO SEE THE TRANSPLANTATION TEAM TO HAVE A POSSIBLE LUNG REMOVED BEFORE I RUN OUT OF TIME BOTH LUNGS ARE FILLED WITH SILICONE AS WELL AS MY KIDNEYS AND MY GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT MY PULMONARY DOCTOR I HAVE HAS BEEN WITH ME FOR 4 YEARS AND SHE HAS SEEN ME GET WORSE THROUGH ON-GOING TESTS AND YEARS WITH THE LUNG BIOPSIES B6 2011 SHOWING SILICONE THROUGHOUT MY LUNGS SHE THEN SAW MY LAST PFTS AND IT WAS WORSE BY 80 SINCE B6 2011 AND MY O2 LEVEL IS AT 7 LITERS NOW IT HAS GONE UP BY 3 LITERS SINCE B6 2010 SO CURRENTLY I AM GOING THROUGH THE PRE-TESTING FOR LUNG TRANSPLANTS TO SEE IF I QUALIFY FOR THE TRANSPLANTS SO I HAVE TO GO THROUGH A LOT OF TESTING TO SEE IF MY BODY CAN HANDLE THE TRANSPLANTS ONLY MY DOCTOR UNDERSTANDS EVERYTHING ABOUT WHAT IMPLANTS CAN DO TO YOU SHE HAS SEEN ME GO THROUGH IT A LOT WHEN MY IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED IN 2007 THE DOCTOR HAD TO LEAVE THE OUTER PART IN BECAUSE MY TISSUE WAS ALREADY TAKEN OVER MY IMPLANTS HAD BEEN LEAKING UP TO 7 YEARS PER THE TIMELINE OF ALL THE ISSUE WITH MY HEALTH PER MY DOCTORS I HOPE THE LUNG TRANSPLANTS WILL BE APPROVE TO PLACE ME ON THE ORGAN
