178340|119725|D|1||"READS: ""ANATOMICALLY SHAPED BREAST IMPLANTS MADE BY MCGHAN MED. THESE BREAST IMPLANTS ARE SALINE FILLED-SILICONE ENVELOPES. IN 1976 MFR'S WERE PERMITTED TO MFR AND SELL BREAST IMPLANTS BY FDA. IN THE SAME YR FDA REQUIRED MFR'S TO SHOW RESEARCHED DATA TO SUPPORT THE USE OF BREAST IMPLANTS. UNTIL THIS RESEARCH COMES OUT, WOMEN PLANNING TO USE BREAST IMPLANTS NEED TO HAVE THE FOLLOWING INFO. BEFORE SURGERY IS SCHEDULED WOMEN NEED TO DISCUSS THE PROS AND CONS OF HAVING BREAST IMPLANTS. BREAST IMPLANTS CAN IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE. PLAY AN IMPORTANT PART IN THE RECOVERY OF WOMEN DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER. SOME WOMEN FIND EXTERNAL BREAST FORMS TO BE SATISFACTORY. TISSUES FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY CAN BE USED TO RECONSTRUCT BREAST. THIS REQUIRES A LONGER OPERATION, LONGER HEALING TIME. BREAST IMPLANT SURGERIES PRESENT THE SAME RISKS AS OTHER SURGERIES, EG ANESTHESIA RELATED RISKS. BREAST IMPLANTS CAN'T BE EXPECTED TO LAST FOREVER. THEY DEFLATE, RUPTURE FOR DIFFERENT REASONS. THEY CAN DEFLATE DUE TO WEAR WITH TIME, RUPTURE DUE TO INJURY. IT IS NOT KNOWN WHEN DEFLATION OCCURS. IT HAS BEEN FOUND THROUGH RESEARCH: WHEN THE SALINE LEAKS IT IS ABSORBED IN THE BODY BECAUSE NORMAL SALINE ALREADY EXISTS IN THE BODY. BREAST IMPLANTS NEED TO BE REMOVED WHEN WORN OUT, MAKE MAMMOGRAPHY DIFFICULT, WOMAN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS RECEIVE MORE RADIATION, THE FORMALIAR OF CAPSULES AROUND THE IMPLANT CAUSES CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CALCIUM DEPOSITS NEED TO BE IDENTIFIED FROM THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH CANCER, INFECTION CAN OCCUR, ESPECIALLY WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF THE OPERATION. INFECTION WITH IMPLANTS ARE HARDER TO TREAT THAN INFECTIONS WITH NORMAL TISSUE. RISK OF HAVING A HEMATOMA: CHANCES OF OCCURRING NOT KNOWN BUT USUALLY OCCURS AFTER SURGERY. SMALL HEMATOMAS CAN BE ABSORBED BY THE BODY, BUT LARGE ONES ARE SURGICALLY DRAINED WHICH CAUSES SCARRING. RESEARCH CONTINUES TO INDICATE THAT FEELING OF PAIN, BURNING SENSTAION MAY INTERFEAR WITH BREAT FEEDING AND SEXUAL RESPONSE. MANY FEEL IMPLANT SHIFTINGS AND FEEL IMPLANT THROUGH THE SKIN. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES LIKE LUPUS, SCLERODERMA, RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND NEUROLOGIC SYMPTOMS SEEN IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PT'S. IN SOME CASES THE SALINE USED HAS BEEN KNOWN TO BE CONTAMINATED WITH BACTERIA. IF SO, ORGANISMS MAY BE RELEASED IN THE BODY IF HER IMPLANTS DEFLATE. ACCORDING TO SCIENTIFIC STUDIES WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS IN GENERAL ARE NOT AT AN INCREASED RISK FOR AUTOIMMUNE OR SELECTIVE TISSUE DISEASES. HOWEVER, THESE STUDIES ARE TOO SMALL TO DETECT WETHER THERE MIGHT BE A SLIGHTLY INCREASED RISK OF ANY OF THESE RARE DISEASES. ALSO THESE CURRENT STUDIES HAVE LOOKED ONLY FOR THE SYMPTOMS OF KNOWN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES, RATHER THAN THE VARIETY OF SYMPTOMS THAT SOME WOMEN ARE EXPERIENCING. SUCH AS SWELLING, JOINT PAIN, ARTHRITIS LIKE PAIN, GENERAL ACHING, UNUSUAL HAIR LOSS, UNEXPLAINED OR UNUSUAL LOSS OF ENERGY, GREATER CHANCE OF GETTING COLDS, VIRUSES, AND FLU SWOLLEN GLANDS OR LYMPH NODES."|ANATOMICALLY SHAPED BREAST IMPLANTS||07/22/1998|A|||*||173408.0||FWM|1.0||BREAST IMPLANTS|Y||700 WARD DR.||SANTA BARBARA|US|MCGHAN MEDICAL CORP.||CA|93111||||True

AFTER HAVING MY SECOND DAUGHTER IN 7/71, PROBLEMS I HAD WITH BOTH MY BREASTS WERE GETTING WORSE. HAVING BEEN SEEN BY MY GENERAL PRACTITIONER, I WAS SENT FOR SCAN ON BOTH BREASTS. FIBROCYSTIC MASTITIS WAS DIAGNOSED, AND I ALSO HAD GREEN FLUID OOZING FROM BOTH NIPPLES ACCOMPANIED WITH SEVERE PAIN. THE TREATMENT I WAS ON WAS DANAZOL, BUT TO NO AVAIL. I SAW MY GENERAL PRACTITIONER AGAIN WHO THEN MADE ME AN APPOINTMENT TO SEE BREAST SURGEON. I HAD NO FURTHER SCANS THAT REVEALED I HAD FIBROCYSTIC MASTITIS; BY THAT TIME FLUID FROM BOTH MY NIPPLES HAD BECOME EMERALD GREEN COLOR, REALLY DARK GREEN, ALSO WITH PAIN BECOMING WORSE. I WAS TOLD TO WRAP HOT WATER BOTTLE IN TOWEL AND PLACE TO MY BREAST; AND I WAS GIVEN PAIN CONTROL DRUGS. I STOOD PAIN UNTIL I COULD NO MORE. IN 6/90, I SAW BREAST SURGEON AGAIN, ASKING HIM IF THERE WAS WAY HE COULD RELIEVE ME FROM TERRIBLE PAIN I WAS IN. I WAS TOLD THAT THERE COULD ONLY BE ONE SOLUTION, AND THAT WAS TO HAVE DOUBLE MASTECTOMY. HE WOULD ONLY DO IT IF I WAS TO HAVE SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. I AGREED. I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE. IN 8/89 I HAD BILATERAL ""MAMMADOCHECTOMY."" THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT EITHER, SO THAT'S WHY I ASKED FOR MASTECTOMY. I SAW BREAST SURGEON WHO REFERRED ME TO PLASTIC SURGEON, AND OPERATION WAS A JOINT ONE. THE BREAST WAS REMOVED, AND BREAST TISSUE DOWN TO MUSCLE (SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY); AND IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION WITH SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. THIS WAS CARRIED OUT IN 1990. I HAD BILATERAL SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY DEEP DOWN TO PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE, IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS IN 1990. THE IMPLANTS BECAME EXPOSED DUE TO SCARS GAPING OPEN, FLUID WAS OOZING OUT. SWABS TAKEN OF FLUID REVEALED AFTER CULTURED PLASMA (KLEBSIELLA AEROGENES). I WAS GIVEN IV 500 MG METRONIDAZOLE, TETRACYCLINE/FLUCLOXACILLIN/PAIN KILLERS TYLOX. I HAD BLOOD TRANSFUSION AND IMPLANTS REMOVED FOLLOWING DAY. I WAS TOLD WHAT HAPPENED WAS JUST A ONE IN A MILLION CHANCE OF EVER HAPPENING, AND THAT I COULD HAVE SECOND ATTEMPT OF BEING REINSERTED WITH THE BREAST IMPLANTS AFTER 8 MOS. I TOOK SURGEON'S OFFER, AND HAD SECOND ATTEMPT OF HAVING SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLANTS. AGAIN IN 1991 I HAD INSERTION OF BREAST IMPLANTS YET AGAIN. IN 1992 I ALSO HAD TO HAVE THEM REMOVED DUE TO SYSTEMIC INFECTION. IN 1997, I CAME ACROSS THE PACKAGE INSERT AND PRODUCT DATA SHEET, CLEARLY STATING THAT MASTITIS OR ANY ACTIVE INFECTION IS CONTRAINDICATED TO USE OF BREAST IMPLANTS MADE FROM SILICONE GEL. I AM SO ILL WITH FIBRO-FATTY CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDER, ACCOMPANIED WITH SEVERE PAIN, PROMINENTLY MARKED VASCULARITY, FIBROMYALGIA, CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME, HYPOTHYROIDISM, PLANTAR FASCIITIS, ARTHRITIS IN KNEES, HANDS AND BACK. I EXPERIENCE NOW SEVERE PAIN IN HANDS, FINGERS, ARMS, THIGHS, BUTTOCKS CHEEKS, HIPS, AND CALVES OF BOTH LEGS. I HAVE LOSS OF BALANCE, LOSS OF WORDS, CONCENTRATION PROBLEMS, DRY EYES, MOUTH, NOSE AND VAGINA. I ALSO HAVE A LOT OF INFECTIONS, BREATHING DIFFICULTY, BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS, THRUSH IN MOUTH/VAGINA, CHEST INFECTIONS, THROAT INFECTIONS, EAR INFECTIONS, BOWEL DISORDER, AND BLADDER PROBLEMS. I HAVE WIDESPREAD PAPILLOMAS, CHEST THROUGH ARMS AND NECK. I HAVE FIBROS TISSUE IN MY JOINTS. I ALSO HAVE PAIN IN MY HEAD; IT IS NOT A HEADACHE, IT IS LIKE WHEN INFECTION AND PUSS THROB LIKE PAIN. LOSS OF SLEEP, DROPPING THINGS, BUMPING INTO THINGS, ELECTRIC SHOCK - LIKE WHEN YOU TOUCH BARE WIRES ON ELECTRICAL GOODS, IF I TOUCH ANYTHING METAL. CRAWLING SENSATION IF I TOUCH NYLON, DRYLON, LEATHER OR POLYESTER; IF I USE TALC PERFUMED AND COLORED SOAP. I ALSO HAVE FOOD ALLERGIES. DUE TO HAVING BACTERIAL INFECTIONS I STILL EVEN TODAY TAKE METRONIDAZOLE, ANTIBIOTICS, AND ANTIFUNGAL MEDICATION TOO. I FEEL VERY WEAK, I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING CHRONIC FLU-LIKE SYMPTOMS, BUT I DON'T HAVE THE FLU. I CAN ONLY STAND, EVEN WALK SHORT PACES BEFORE BECOMING EXHAUSTED, AND MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE SEVERE PAIN I SUFFER FROM. I'M IN MY EARLY 40'S, BUT AT THIS MOMENT I FEEL LIKE 90, AND IT ISN'T RIGHT. DOCTORS I'M UNDER DON'T KNOW HOW TO BEGIN TO TREAT ME. HOWEVER, THEY KNOW WHAT CAUSE IS BUT AT THIS MOMENT CANNOT OFFER ANY KIND OF TREATMENT. I AM A TEST CASE OVER HERE OF THE DOCTORS WHO ARE DEALING WITH ME. LET'S HOPE SOMETHING CAN BE DONE PRETTY SOON. I DO BLAME SURGEONS FOR THEIR IGNORANCE AND STUPIDITY OF WAY THEY HAVE TREATED ME IN THE FIRST PLACE. TO BEGIN WITH, FOR IGNORING THE PRODUCT DATA SHEETS OF ALL BREAST IMPLANTS, ALONG WITH IGNORING THE PACKAGE INSERTS TOO. I HAVE LOST ALL TRUST AND FAITH IN MEDICAL PROFESSION. THE GOVERNMENT: FOR REFUSING TO CARRY OUT ANY KIND OF RESEARCH OR TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE LIKE ME WITH SAME ILLNESS; TREATMENT WE NEED SO DESPERATELY TO GET WELL. I KNOW I'M AS TOUGH AS NAILS. I DON'T INTEND TO SIT BACK AND DO NOTHING. I'M DETERMINED TO GET SOMEWHERE AND GET TREATMENT I SO DESPERATELY NEED. UP UNTIL 1989 I USED TO WORK FULL TIME, 16 HRS A DAY IN A CUTLERY FACTORY. I ALSO TOOK CARE OF MY MOM WHO DIED FROM TERMINAL CANCER BACK IN 1985. I ALSO TOOK CARE OF MY FATHER WHO ALSO DIED FROM A TERMINAL DISEASE. BOTH OF MY PARENTS DIED FROM CHEST ILLNESSES, MOST OF MY FATHER'S FAMILY DIED FROM TUBERCULOSIS, LUNG CANCER, HEART ATTACKS, AND STROKES. IN MY MOM'S FAMILY THEY DIED OF LUNG/BREAST CANCER ETHACENIA. THEY ALL WENT TO OPEN AIR SCHOOL. I WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS BORN IN PERFECT HEALTH, THAT IS UNTIL I MARRIED AND HAD CHILDREN AT THE AGE OF 16."" HISTORY: PT SUFFERED FROM CHRONIC BREAST PAIN FOR A PERIOD OF APPROX 20 YRS AND WHICH WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CYSTIC MASTITIS. VARIOUS CONSERVATIVE, DRUG TREATMENT REGIMES WERE TRIED TO HELP HER WITH THIS PROBLEM BUT TO NO AVAIL. SHE DESCRIBES HAVING A COLORED DISCHARGE COMING FROM HER NIPPLES IN ADDITION TO THE PAIN. SHE CAME UNDER THE CARE OF A CONSULTANT GENERAL SURGEON WHO PERFORMED AN OPERATION ON HER BREAST DUCTS IN 1989.

ATTEMPTING TO REMOVE THE POSTERIOR CAPSULE RESULTED IN BLEEDING, SO THE POSTERIOR CAPSULES AND CHEST WALL WERE LEFT IN PLACE. 6 MOS AFTER EXPLANTATION, BREASTS BECAME SWOLLEN AND SEVERELY PAINFUL - SO TENDER THAT CLOTHES COULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO TOUCH THEM. USER WENT TO PAIN CLINIC FOR 2 YEARS, RECEIVED PAIN MEDICATION, ADD'L SURGERY AND WAS REFERRED TO HAVE A NEUROLOGY CONSULTATION. THE PAIN MEDICATION AND TREATMENTS HAVEN'T BEEN EFFECTIVE SO FAR, BUT THE DRS PERSIST IN TRYING TO HELP. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: BILATERAL CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. MATERIAL FORWARDED TO LAB FOR EXAMINATION: 1. IMPLANT RIGHT BREAST. 2. IMPLANT LEFT BREAST. 3. RIGHT BREAST IMPLANT CAPSULE. 4. LEFT BREAST IMPLANT CAPSULE. OPERATION PERFORMED: EXPLANTATION AND ANTERIOR CAPSULECTOMY BILATERAL BREASTS. DATE OF OPERATION: 1996. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: INDICATIONS: THIS PT IS A 45-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH A HISTORY OF BILATERAL IMPLANTS AFTER SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMIES IN 1984. SHE HAS HAD INCREASE IN DISTORTION AND PAIN OVER ONE YEAR AND WISHES TO HAVE THE IMPLANTS REMOVED. I HAVE DISCUSSED MULTIPLE RECONSTRUCTIVE OPTIONS WITH THIS PT IN DETAIL AND AT THIS TIME SHE CURRENTLY WISHES TO HAVE EXPLANT ONLY. PROCEDURE: THE PT WAS BROUGHT IN THE OR AND PLACED IN A SUPINE POSITION WHERE SATISFACTORY GENERAL ENDOTRACHEAL ANESTHESIA WAS PERFORMED. SHE WAS THEN PREPPED AND DRAPED IN THE NORMAL STERILE MANNER. AFTER STERILE PREPPING AND DRAPING, AN INCISION WAS PERFORMED ON THE RIGHT BREAST LATERALLY THROUGH THE OLD MASTECTOMY INCISION. DISSECTION WAS CARRIED DOWN THROUGH SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE TO THE IMPLANT. THE IMPLANT AND IMPLANT GAPS WERE DISSECTED FREE SUPERIORLY, MEDIALLY AND LATERALLY AND WHEN THE LIMITS OF DISSECTION WERE REACHED THE CAPSULE WAS OPENED AND THE IMPLANT WAS REMOVED. THE IMPLANT WAS NOTED TO BE INTACT BUT WAS NOTED TO BE A MCGHAN 320 CC IMPLANT. THE ANTERIOR CAPSULE WAS THEN REMOVED AND THE POSTERIOR CAPSULE AND THE CHEST WALL WERE LEFT INTACT, AS THERE WAS NO RUPTURE AND ATTEMPTING TO GET THIS CAPSULE OFF RESULTED IN SOME BLEEDING. THEREFORE, THIS WAS ABANDONED. ATTENTION WAS DIRECTED TO THE CONTRALATERAL SIDE, WHERE A SIMILAR INCISION WAS MADE AND DISSECTION ONCE AGAIN CARRIED DOWN THROUGH SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE TO THE IMPLANT CAPSULE. DISSECTION AGAIN PROCEEDED SUPERIORLY, MEDIALLY AND LATERALLY AND THE IMPLANT CAPSULE WAS OPENED AND INTACT IMPLANT WAS REMOVED. THIS WAS ALSO A MCGHAN 320 CC IMPLANT. THE ANTERIOR CAPSULE WAS THEN REMOVED. THE WOUNDS WERE THOROUGHLY AND COPIOUSLY IRRIGATED AND A JACKSON-PRATT DRAIN WAS PLACED THROUGH A SEPARATE STAB INCISION; AND THE WOUND WAS CLOSED IN LAYERS. THE DEEP TISSUE WAS CLOSED USING INTERRUPTED 4-0 VICRYL. DEEP DERMIS WAS CLOSED USING 4-0 VICRYL AND THE SKIN WAS CLOSED USING A RUNNING 6-0 NYLON. THE PT TOLERATED THE PROCEDURE WELL AND WAS EXTUBATED IN THE OR AND WAS TAKEN TO THE RECOVERY ROOM IN STABLE CONDITION. DOCTOR'S PROGRESS NOTE STATES ""PT S/P REMOVAL OF RT BREAST IMPLANT IN 1996.

PHYSICIAN WRITES, ""I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST POINT OUT THAT I INITIALLY SAW AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONSULTANT DURING HER HOSPITALIZATION IN JUNE OF 1978. AT THAT TIME, SHE HAD UNDERGONE BILATERAL BREAST REMOVAL WITH THE SUBSEQUENT REPLACEMENT OF SILASTIC IMPLANTS. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING SURGERY, SHE DEVELOPED A FEVER THAT PERSISTED. NO OBVIOUS SIGN OF INFECTION WAS DETACHED.

226777|15491731|D|1||"RPTR WRITES, ""AFTER HAVING MY DAUGHTER IN 6/70 I HAD PROBLEMS WITH BOTH MY BREASTS. AFTER HAVING MY SECOND DAUGHTER IN 7/71, THE PROBLEMS I HAD WITH BOTH MY BREASTS WERE GETTING WORSE. HAVING BEEN SEEN BY MY GENERAL PRACTITIONER, I WAS SENT FOR SCAN ON BOTH BREASTS. FIBROCYSTIC MASTITIS WAS DIAGNOSED; I ALSO HAD GREEN FLUID OOZING FROM BOTH NIPPLES ACCOMPANIED WITH SEVERE PAIN. THE TREATMENT I WAS ON WAS DANAZOL, BUT TO NO AVAIL. I SAW MY GENERAL PRACTITIONER AGAIN WHO THEN MADE ME APPOINTMENT TO SEE BREAST SURGEON. I HAD NO FURTHER SCANS THAT REVEALED I HAD FIBROCYSTIC MASTITIS; BY THAT TIME FLUID FROM BOTH MY NIPPLES HAD BECOME EMERALD GREEN COLOR, REALLY DARK GREEN, ALSO WITH PAIN BECOMING WORSE. I WAS TOLD TO WRAP HOT WATER BOTTLE IN TOWEL AND PLACE TO MY BREAST; AND I WAS GIVEN PAIN CONTROL DRUGS. I STOOD THE PAIN UNTIL I COULD NO MORE. IN 6/90, I SAW BREAST SURGEON AGAIN, ASKING HIM IF THERE WAS A WAY HE COULD RELIEVE ME FROM TERRIBLE PAIN I WAS IN. I WAS TOLD THAT THERE COULD ONLY BE ONE SOLUTION, AND THAT WAS TO HAVE DOUBLE MASTECTOMY. HE WOULD ONLY DO IT IF I WAS TO HAVE SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. I AGREED. I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE. IN 8/89 I HAD BILATERAL ""MAMMADOCHECTOMY."" THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT EITHER, SO THAT'S WHY I ASKED FOR MASTECTOMY. I SAW BREAST SURGEON WHO REFERRED ME TO PLASTIC SURGEON, AND THE OPERATION WAS A JOINT ONE. THE BREAST WAS REMOVED, AND BREAST TISSUE DOWN TO MUSCLE (SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY); AND IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION WITH SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. THIS WAS CARRIED OUT IN 1990. I HAD BILATERAL SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY DEEP DOWN TO PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE, IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS IN 1990. THE IMPLANTS BECAME EXPOSED DUE TO SCARS GAPING OPEN, FLUID WAS OOZING OUT. SWABS TAKEN OF FLUID REVEALED AFTER CULTURED PLASMA (KLEBSIELLA AEROGENES). I WAS GIVEN IV 500 MG METRONIDAZOLE, TETRACYCLINE/FLUCLOXACILLIN/PAIN KILLERS TYLOX. I HAD BLOOD TRANSFUSION AND THE IMPLANTS REMOVED THE FOLLOWING DAY. I WAS TOLD WHAT HAPPENED WAS JUST A ONE IN A MILLION CHANCE OF EVER HAPPENING, AND THAT I COULD HAVE SECOND ATTEMPT OF BEING REINSERTED WITH THE BREAST IMPLANTS AFTER 8 MOS. I TOOK SURGEON'S OFFER, AND HAD SECOND ATTEMPT OF HAVING SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLANTS. AGAIN IN 1991 I HAD INSERTION OF BREAST IMPLANTS YET AGAIN. IN 1992 I ALSO HAD TO HAVE THEM REMOVED DUE TO SYSTEMIC INFECTION. IN 1997, I CAME ACROSS THE PACKAGE INSERT AND PRODUCT DATA SHEET, CLEARLY STATING THAT MASTITIS OR ANY ACTIVE INFECTION IS CONTRAINDICATED TO THE USE OF BREAST IMPLANTS MADE FROM SILICONE GEL. I AM SO ILL WITH FIBRO-FATTY CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDER, ACCOMPANIED WITH SEVERE PAIN, PROMINENTLY MARKED VASCULARITY, FIBROMYALGIA, CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME, HYPOTHYROIDISM, PLANTAR FASCIITIS, ARTHRITIS IN KNEES, HANDS AND BACK. I EXPERIENCE NOW SEVERE PAIN IN HANDS, FINGERS, ARMS, THIGHS, BUTTOCKS CHEEKS, HIPS, AND CALVES OF BOTH LEGS. I HAVE LOSS OF BALANCE, LOSS OF WORDS, CONCENTRATION PROBLEMS, DRY EYES, MOUTH, NOSE AND VAGINA. I ALSO HAVE A LOT OF INFECTIONS, BREATHING DIFFICULTY, BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS, THRUSH IN MOUTH/VAGINA, CHEST INFECTIONS, THROAT INFECTIONS, EAR INFECTIONS, BOWEL DISORDER, AND BLADDER PROBLEMS. I HAVE WIDESPREAD PAPILLOMAS, CHEST THROUGH ARMS AND NECK. I HAVE FIBROS TISSUE IN MY JOINTS. I ALSO HAVE PAIN IN MY HEAD; IT IS NOT A HEADACHE, IT IS LIKE WHEN INFECTION AND PUSS THROB LIKE PAIN. LOSS OF SLEEP, DROPPING THINGS, BUMPING INTO THINGS, ELECTRIC SHOCK - LIKE WHEN YOU TOUCH BARE WIRES ON ELECTRICAL GOODS, IF I TOUCH ANYTHING METAL. CRAWLING SENSATION IF I TOUCH NYLON, DRYLON, LEATHER OR POLYESTER; IF I USE TALC PERFUMED AND COLORED SOAP. I ALSO HAVE FOOD ALLERGIES. DUE TO HAVING BACTERIAL INFECTIONS I STILL EVEN TODAY TAKE METRONIDAZOLE, ANTIBIOTICS, AND ANTIFUNGAL MEDICATION TOO. I FEEL VERY WEAK, I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING CHRONIC FLU-LIKE SYMPTOMS, BUT I DON'T HAVE THE FLU.

226777|15491731|D|1||"RPTR WRITES, ""AFTER HAVING MY DAUGHTER IN 6/70 I HAD PROBLEMS WITH BOTH MY BREASTS. AFTER HAVING MY SECOND DAUGHTER IN 7/71, THE PROBLEMS I HAD WITH BOTH MY BREASTS WERE GETTING WORSE. HAVING BEEN SEEN BY MY GENERAL PRACTITIONER, I WAS SENT FOR SCAN ON BOTH BREASTS. FIBROCYSTIC MASTITIS WAS DIAGNOSED; I ALSO HAD GREEN FLUID OOZING FROM BOTH NIPPLES ACCOMPANIED WITH SEVERE PAIN. THE TREATMENT I WAS ON WAS DANAZOL, BUT TO NO AVAIL. I SAW MY GENERAL PRACTITIONER AGAIN WHO THEN MADE ME APPOINTMENT TO SEE BREAST SURGEON. I HAD NO FURTHER SCANS THAT REVEALED I HAD FIBROCYSTIC MASTITIS; BY THAT TIME FLUID FROM BOTH MY NIPPLES HAD BECOME EMERALD GREEN COLOR, REALLY DARK GREEN, ALSO WITH PAIN BECOMING WORSE. I WAS TOLD TO WRAP HOT WATER BOTTLE IN TOWEL AND PLACE TO MY BREAST; AND I WAS GIVEN PAIN CONTROL DRUGS. I STOOD THE PAIN UNTIL I COULD NO MORE. IN 6/90, I SAW BREAST SURGEON AGAIN, ASKING HIM IF THERE WAS A WAY HE COULD RELIEVE ME FROM TERRIBLE PAIN I WAS IN. I WAS TOLD THAT THERE COULD ONLY BE ONE SOLUTION, AND THAT WAS TO HAVE DOUBLE MASTECTOMY. HE WOULD ONLY DO IT IF I WAS TO HAVE SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. I AGREED. I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE. IN 8/89 I HAD BILATERAL ""MAMMADOCHECTOMY."" THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT EITHER, SO THAT'S WHY I ASKED FOR MASTECTOMY. I SAW BREAST SURGEON WHO REFERRED ME TO PLASTIC SURGEON, AND THE OPERATION WAS A JOINT ONE. THE BREAST WAS REMOVED, AND BREAST TISSUE DOWN TO MUSCLE (SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY); AND IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION WITH SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. THIS WAS CARRIED OUT IN 1990. I HAD BILATERAL SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY DEEP DOWN TO PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE, IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS IN 1990. THE IMPLANTS BECAME EXPOSED DUE TO SCARS GAPING OPEN, FLUID WAS OOZING OUT. SWABS TAKEN OF FLUID REVEALED AFTER CULTURED PLASMA (KLEBSIELLA AEROGENES). I WAS GIVEN IV 500 MG METRONIDAZOLE, TETRACYCLINE/FLUCLOXACILLIN/PAIN KILLERS TYLOX. I HAD BLOOD TRANSFUSION AND THE IMPLANTS REMOVED THE FOLLOWING DAY. I WAS TOLD WHAT HAPPENED WAS JUST A ONE IN A MILLION CHANCE OF EVER HAPPENING, AND THAT I COULD HAVE SECOND ATTEMPT OF BEING REINSERTED WITH THE BREAST IMPLANTS AFTER 8 MOS. I TOOK SURGEON'S OFFER, AND HAD SECOND ATTEMPT OF HAVING SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLANTS. AGAIN IN 1991 I HAD INSERTION OF BREAST IMPLANTS YET AGAIN. IN 1992 I ALSO HAD TO HAVE THEM REMOVED DUE TO SYSTEMIC INFECTION. IN 1997, I CAME ACROSS THE PACKAGE INSERT AND PRODUCT DATA SHEET, CLEARLY STATING THAT MASTITIS OR ANY ACTIVE INFECTION IS CONTRAINDICATED TO THE USE OF BREAST IMPLANTS MADE FROM SILICONE GEL. I AM SO ILL WITH FIBRO-FATTY CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDER, ACCOMPANIED WITH SEVERE PAIN, PROMINENTLY MARKED VASCULARITY, FIBROMYALGIA, CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME, HYPOTHYROIDISM, PLANTAR FASCIITIS, ARTHRITIS IN KNEES, HANDS AND BACK. I EXPERIENCE NOW SEVERE PAIN IN HANDS, FINGERS, ARMS, THIGHS, BUTTOCKS CHEEKS, HIPS, AND CALVES OF BOTH LEGS. I HAVE LOSS OF BALANCE, LOSS OF WORDS, CONCENTRATION PROBLEMS, DRY EYES, MOUTH, NOSE AND VAGINA. I ALSO HAVE A LOT OF INFECTIONS, BREATHING DIFFICULTY, BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS, THRUSH IN MOUTH/VAGINA, CHEST INFECTIONS, THROAT INFECTIONS, EAR INFECTIONS, BOWEL DISORDER, AND BLADDER PROBLEMS. I HAVE WIDESPREAD PAPILLOMAS, CHEST THROUGH ARMS AND NECK. I HAVE FIBROS TISSUE IN MY JOINTS. I ALSO HAVE PAIN IN MY HEAD; IT IS NOT A HEADACHE, IT IS LIKE WHEN INFECTION AND PUSS THROB LIKE PAIN. LOSS OF SLEEP, DROPPING THINGS, BUMPING INTO THINGS, ELECTRIC SHOCK - LIKE WHEN YOU TOUCH BARE WIRES ON ELECTRICAL GOODS, IF I TOUCH ANYTHING METAL. CRAWLING SENSATION IF I TOUCH NYLON, DRYLON, LEATHER OR POLYESTER; IF I USE TALC PERFUMED AND COLORED SOAP. I ALSO HAVE FOOD ALLERGIES. DUE TO HAVING BACTERIAL INFECTIONS I STILL EVEN TODAY TAKE METRONIDAZOLE, ANTIBIOTICS, AND ANTIFUNGAL MEDICATION TOO. I FEEL VERY WEAK, I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING CHRONIC FLU-LIKE SYMPTOMS, BUT I DON'T HAVE THE FLU. I CAN ONLY STAND, EVEN WALK SHORT PACES BEFORE BECOMING EXHAUSTED, AND MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE SEVERE PAIN I SUFFER FROM. I'M IN MY EARLY 40'S, BUT AT THIS MOMENT I FEEL LIKE 90, AND IT ISN'T RIGHT.

I BEGAN TO ACHE ALL OVER, HAD PANIC ATTACKS, MY VISION CHANGED RAPIDLY. I KEPT REPORTING VARIOUS COMPLAINTS TO MY PHYSICIANS, NO ONE COULD HELP ME, EVEN THOUGH THEY KEPT TRYING.

THE SYMPTOMS PROGRESSED RAPIDLY, EACH TIME THEY WENT BACK IN, THEY USED THE SAME IMPLANTS, EVEN REFILLED THE ONE THAT LEAKED. MY MAMMOGRAMS SHOWED A BULGE, THE RADIOLOGIST ADVISED ME TO REMOVE THEM, THE PLASTIC SURGEON DENIED WHAT THE FILM SHOWED. I HAD A SONOGRAM LATER, AND IT SHOWED MY LYMPH NODES WERE SWOLLEN.

I HAVE NIGHT SWEATS, MY FACE IS GETTING A PINK RASH OVER MY NOSE. MY BRAIN HAS ELECTRIC LIGHT SHOWS, AND I WAKE UP EXHAUSTED. MY WHOLE LIFE HAS CHANGED.

MY VOICE HAS CHANGED, MY SPEECH IS SLURRED, I'M NOT ME NOW. MY FACE HAS BROKEN OUT IN BLISTERS, I'M ALLERGIC TO THE SUN, AND I HAVE ASTHMA NOW. I CAN'T BEGIN TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAS HAPPENED. I HAVE SOMEONE TYPING FOR ME, MY BRAIN CAN'T PUT THE WORDS TOGETHER NOW. I HAD NONE OF THESE PROBLEMS BEFORE IMPLANTS. I WAS NEVER TOLD OF THE CHEMICALS IN IMPLANTS. I WAS TOLD THAT IT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER TO DETECT BREAST CANCER. I HAD FIBRO-CYSTIC BREAST DISEASE. I AM POSITIVE THE IMPLANTS ARE WHAT HAS CAUSED ME TO BECOME EXTREMELY DISABLED, I AM FORCED TO FILE FOR DISABILITY. I WOULD RATHER BE THE PRODUCTIVE PERSON I WAS BEFORE I HAD SILICONE IMPLANTS. I RARELY AM ABLE TO GO OUT. I CAN'T HOLD MY GRANDBABIES OR PARTICIPATE IN A NORMAL LIFE. I AM SEXUALLY NOT A LADY NOW. I CAN'T HAVE A CLIMAX, MY VAGINA IS SO DRY, AND PAINFUL. WHY DID THE FDA ALLOW THIS? I THOUGHT IMPLANTS WERE SAFE, AND HAD BEEN APPROVED. NOW I'M READING I'VE BEEN TOXICALLY POISONED. I TRY TO USE MY MIND TO CONTROL PAIN. I AM ILL, I WANT TO BE WELL, I WANT TO BE FREE FROM ALL OF THE THINGS I HAVE WRONG WITH ME NOW. I TRY SO HARD, BUT I CAN'T DO THINGS. I WILL NEVER GIVE UP TRYING. I WISH I WAS WELL ENOUGH TO BE ME AGAIN NOW. I STAY AWAY FROM THE DOCTORS, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY MORE. I CAN'T HEAR WELL, AND I'M SO TIRED. I DON'T LEAD A NORMAL LIFE. I'M SICK, AND I'M JUST TRYING TO HIDE FROM ANY MORE TESTS, OR HOSPS. THESE CHEST PAINS WERE NEVER NORMAL FOR A 35 YEAR OLD LADY WHO EXERCIZED, WAS PHYSICALLY IN SHAPE. NOW I CAN'T RAISE MY ARMS, THE PAIN GOES FROM MY BREAST CLEAR DOWN TO MY FINGERTIPS. I CAN'T TELL YOU ANY MORE, IT'S TOO UPSETTING TO LOOK AT. I HAD A HYSTERECTOMY, I HEMORRHAGED FOR MONTHS. I'VE HAD A KIDNEY STONE, MY BLADDER IS BLOCKED, INFECTED ALL THE TIME, AND THEY CAN'T DO SURGERY. I HAVE A YEAST INFECTION CONTINUALLY. MY NAILS HAVE HAD A FUNGUS. MY SKIN HAS HUGE BLOOD PLACES THE SIZE OF A MAN'S HAND, ON MY FOREARMS ALWAYS, MY SKIN IS LIKE TISSUE PAPER. I FREEZE WHEN IT IS 90 DEGREES. SINUS, OH I COULD JUST KEEP GOING ON, AND ON BUT I WON'T. I THINK YOU HAVE READ ENOUGH. I'M BACK IN KINDERGARTEN, AND I WAS INTELLIGENT ONCE.

487721|302479|D|1||"PT WAS RAISED ON A RANCH AND PT OWNED A RANCH MOST OF THEIR ADULT LIFE. PT WAS A VERY HARD WORKER AND PT WAS HARDLY SICK A DAY IN THEIR LIFE. IN 1990 PT HAD REMARRIED AND THOUGHT THEY NEEDED TO LOOK YOUNGER, SO THEY OPTED TO GET SILICONE BREAST IMPALNTS. PT HAD TALKED TO A PLASTIC SURGEON AND HE TOLD THEM THEY WERE SAFE AND THEY WOULD LAST PT'S LIFETIME. HE TOLD THEM THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD RUPTURE THEM WOULD BE A CAR WRECK OR SOME OTHER HARD BLOW. SO, IN 1990 PT HAD MCGHAN SILICONE IMPLANTS IMPLANTED. PT HAD BEEN WORKING IN CLOTHING FACTORY FOR THREE YEARS AT THE TIME PT GOT THE SILICONE IMPLANTS. PT LOVED THEIR JOB AND HAD NEVER MISSED A DAY OF WORK DUE TO ILLNESS. WITHIN FOUR MONTHS OF GETTING THE IMPLANTS PT NOTICED THEY WERE ACHING ALL OVER AND HAD DEVELOPED HEADACHES. THEY WENT BACK TO THE SURGEON WHO THEY HAD GOTTEN THE IMPLANTS FROM AND TOLD HIM THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE MAKING PT SICK. HE TOLD PT THEY WERE LISTENING TOO MUCH TO THE MEDIA AND HE SAW NO REASON TO REMOVE THEM. HE SAID HE SERIOUSLY DOUBTED THE IMPLANTS HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH PT'S ILLNESS. HE TOLD PT THEY HAD MORE RISK FROM GETTING AN INFECTION FROM THE EXPLANTATION THAN THE IMPLANTS HARMING PT. PT BELIEVED HIM AND LEFT THEM IN. PT BECAME MORE ILL AND THE HEADACHES BECAME ALMOST UNBEARABLE. PT MISSED WORK WEEKLY. PT STARTED HAVING SUCH BACK PAIN WITH THE HEADACHES THAT THEY HAD TO QUIT THEIR JOB. IN THE NEXT YEAR PT HAD TO HAVE BACK SURGERY. PT HAD BECOME SO ILL THAT THEY WERE PUT ON SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY. IN THE MID NINETIES PT'S NASAL PASSAGES STARTED BURNING AND THEIR NOSE WAS SWELLING SHUT, IN ADDITION TO THE HORRIBLE HEADACHES. BY THEN THE HEADACHES WERE SO BAD THAT PT HAD TO GO TO ER WITH THEM. THEIR GP SENT PT TO A NEUROLOGIST WHO DID MANY TESTS AND SENT PT TO AN ENT. PT ENDED UP GOING TO THREE ENTS AND HAVING THREE SINUS SURGERIES. THEY ALL TOLD PT THAT SOMETHING WAS INFLAMING THEIR NASAL PASSAGES. THEY TOLD PT THAT IF PT DIDN'T FIND OUT WHAT THEIR BODY WAS REACTING TO, THEY COULDN'T HELP PT. PT WENT TO AN ALLERGIST AND HE FOUND NO ALLERGIES. PT TOLD THEIR SPOUSE MANY TIMES THAT THEY FELT LIKE THEY WERE BEING POISONED. PT HAD THE HOUSE CHECKED FOR ANY TOXINS. SPOUSE CHECKED THE VEHICLES. BY NOW, THEY WERE FEELING MUCH WORSE. THEY FELT DIZZY AND NAUSEATED OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, PT WENT TO MANY DRS. PT WENT TO OTHER FACILITY AND THEY TOLD PT THEIR ILLNESS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THEIR IMPLANTS. PT WENT TO ANOTHER FACILITY AND THEY BOTH TOLD PT THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THEM. PT FOUND ALL THE DRS THAT THEY WENT TO, HEDGING AROUND THE SILICONE SUBJECT. IT WAS LIKE THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. SO THEY JUST SENT PT ON THEIR WAY. PT WAS BECOMING SO VERY FRUSTRATED AND ALONE. THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS PT BECAME SO ILL THEY ARE ALMOST BEDRIDDEN. THEIR NASAL PASSAGES BURN ALL THE TIME AND THEIR HEADACHES ARE CONSTANT. PT CAN HARDLY WALK AS THEIR LEGS AND FEET SWELL AND THEY ACHE ALL OVER. PT IS DIZZY AND NAUSEATED. PT HAS LOST MUCH OF THEIR SHORT-TERM MEMORY. PT HAS DEVELOPED AN IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT. PT FEELS ELECTRIC JOLTS SHOOTING THROUGH THEIR BRAIN. SOME TIMES THEY FEEL LIKE THEY WILL PASS OUT. THEY SWEAT SO BADLY DAY AND NIGHT THAT THEY HAVE TO CHANGE BEDDING AND CLOTHES CONSTANTLY. OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THEY HAVE BECOME INTOLERANT OF MOST CHEMICALS. THEY CAN'T CONSUME OR BREATH ANY CHEMICAL WITHOUT BECOMING EXTREMELY ILL. IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR, THEY FINALLY DECIDED THEY WERE GOING TO DIE IF THEY DIDN'T DO SOMETHING. THE DRS WERE NOT ABLE TO HELP PT. THEY EITHER WEREN'T ABLE TO OR WERE UNWILLING, DUE TO THEIR LACK OF THE PROPER FACTS. DUE TO THE CHEMICAL REACTION, PT DECIDED ON THEIR OWN THAT IT WAS THE SILICONE. PT DOSEN'T CARE HOW MANY DRS TOLD THEM IT WASN'T THE SILICONE. PT KNOWS IT IS. IN AUGUST OF THIS YEAR PT WENT TO A VERY GOOD PLASTIC SURGEON AND SHE TOOK THE IMPLANTS OUT. SHE FOUND THE LEFT IMPANT RUPTURED. SHE SAID THERE WAS VERY LITTLE SILICONE ACTUALLY LEFT IN THE CASE. THE SILICONE HAD MIGRATED DOWN INTO PT'S CHEST AND INTO PT'S LYMPH NODES. THEY DESCRIBED IT AS ""A STICKY MESS"". SHE ALSO REMOVED THE LYMPH NODES WITH SILICONE IN THEM. AT THAT TIME SHE TOLD PT ""THERE WAS PROBABLY SILICONE IN THEIR LIVER, LUNGS AND BRAIN"". THE RIGHT IMPLANT WAS INTACT. PT HAS NO IDEA HOW LONG THE LEFT IMPLANT HAD BEEN RUPTURED. SINCE PT IS DISABLED AND ON MEDICARE, PT HAD TO PAY FOR THE EXPLANTATION. SPOUSE HAD TO TAKE OFF FROM WORK TO TAKE PT AND THEY LOST 10 DAYS OF WORK. IT COSTS THEM $15,000 FOR THE SURGERY, GAS, MOTELS AND LOSS OF SPOUSE'S WAGES. FAMILY USED THEIR SAVING TO PAY FOR THE SURGERY AND TRIP EXPENSES. PT FEELS THEY HAVE LOST THE LAST 13 YEARS OF THEIR LIFE. IF THE DR HAD NOT TOLD PT THEIR ILLNESS WAS NOT CAUSED BY THE SILICONE IMPLANTS, PT WOULD HAVE HAD THEM OUT MANY YEARS AGO AND COULD HAVE SAVED MUCH MORE OF THEIR HEALTH. IT TAKES MANY YEARS TO TEST TO SEE IF A PRODUCT IS SAFE. PT FEELS MANY OF US HAVE BEEN THE GUINEA PIGS. AND PT FEELS IT IS PROVEN THAT SILICONE IS NOT SAFE. IT'S TOO LATE TO DO MUCH FOR PEOPLE LIKE PT, BUT LET'S PLEASE SAVE THE NEXT GENERATION. THERE ARE SO MANY WOMEN OUT HERE SUFFERING IN SILENCE AND FEELING LOST, HELPLESS AND BETRAYED. PLEASE DO ANYTHING YOU CAN TO STOP THE PEOPLE FROM BRINGING THEIR PRESCRIPTIONS BACK FROM CANADA BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID THE DRUGS WEREN'T SAFE. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE CLAIMING TO BE ILL FROM THAT? PT FEELS NO ONE SEEMS TO CARE THAT SILICONE IS POISONING WOMEN BY THE THOUSANDS."|MCGHAN|*|09/13/2003|V|||Y||476585.0|0HP|FTR|1.0||SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS|Y|CY6259|*||*|*|MCGHAN|||||*|NO. 25-45361|True

TWENTY YEARS AGO, I GOT MY 1ST IMPLANTS (SILICONE). AFTER A FEW YEARS I GOT A ""CAPSULE"" AND LIVED WITH IT UNTIL THE FOLLOWING FIVE YEARS. AT THAT POINT, I WENT TO DR AND HAD THEM REPLACED WITH ANOTHER SET OF SILICONE IMPLANTS. I FEEL THAT HE DID A VERY GOOD JOB AND WAS HAPPY WITH THEM FOR ALMOST 10 YEARS. IN 2004, I STARTED FEELING SICK, IN MANY WAYS AND MY IMPLANTS FELT DIFFERENT TO ME. I FELT STRONGLY THAT ONE OR BOTH HAD BURST BUT BECAUSE OF LACK OF FUNDS I WAS UNABLE TO FIND OUT OR HAVE THEM REPLACED. EVER SINCE THE SPRING/SUMMER OF 2004, I ""MYSTERIOUSLY"" DEVELOPED VITILIGO (A VERY RARE DISEASE. ESPECIALLY IN CAUCASIANS). I ALSO CAME DOWN WITH INFECTION AFTER INFECTION, AFTER INFECTION, WITH NO BREAKS. MY DOCTORS RAN COUNTLESS TESTS AND COULD NOT FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING. I WAS TESTED FOR AIDS, HIV, LUPUS, STRESS ECO, ULTRA SOUNDS, THYROID, ETC... TOO MANY TO NOTE HERE. I WOULD GLADLY GIVE YOU PERMISSION TO TALK TO MY DOCTOR WHO HAS YET TO FIGURE OUT WHY I WAS BEING PLAGUED WITH ALL THIS ILLNESS. I ALSO CAME DOWN WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AT THAT SAME TIME. I WAS CONSTANTLY EXHAUSTED AND TORTURED BY MY ILLNESSES AND NOT KNOWING WHY. I WAS ON MANY ANTIBIOTICS EVERY 2-3 WEEKS, MOSTLY CIPRO, FROM 2004-2006. THE DEPRESSION I HAVE SUFFERED AND TIME LOST COULD NEVER BE REPLACED OR PAID FOR. IN 2006, I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO AFFORD TO HAVE THEM REPLACED BY DR. WHEN I EXPRESSED TO HIM THAT I FELT MY IMPLANTS HAD RUPTURED AND CAUSED MY ILLNESS HE SUDDENLY REFUSED TO DO MY SURGERY. HIS PARTNER DR AGREED TO DO THE SURGERY AND AFTER THE SURGERY ADMITTED THAT THE LONGEST AND MOST DIFFICULT PART OF THE SURGERY WAS REMOVING LARGE AMOUNTS OF SILICONE FROM MY BODY. HIS EXACT WORDS WERE THAT ""IT WAS A MESS."" THE DAY I LEFT HIS OFFICE THAT DAY, I HAVEN'T HAD ANYMORE INFECTIONS. HOWEVER, THE VITILIGO REMAINS AND IS GETTING WORSE. I BELIEVE THAT REGARDING THAT, THE DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE AND CANNOT BE REVERSED. I FEEL MUCH BETTER SINCE THEY WERE REMOVED AND REPLACED. ALMOST A YEAR AFTER MY SURGERY, I CALLED FOR A CHECK UP, TO MAKE SURE THEY LOOKED RIGHT AND WERE AS THEY SHOULD BE. ONE DAY AFTER THAT I RECEIVED A CALL FROM DR'S OFFICE AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD FORGOTTEN TO HAVE ME SIGN A CONSENT FORM BEFORE MY SURGERY (ALMOST A YEAR BEFORE) AND THAT THEY WERE SENDING IT TO ME IN THE MAIL TO SIGN AND SEND BACK TO THEM. THE FORM WAS FOR MY CONSENT TO HAVE MENTOR IMPLANTS PUT IN MY BODY AND BE PART OF THEIR STUDY. I NEVER RECEIVED OR SAW THIS PRIOR TO MY SURGERY. IF I HAD SEEN THAT IT WAS THE SAME COMPANY, THAT I STRONGLY BELIEVE, MADE ME SICK, I MAY HAVE CHOSEN ANOTHER OPTION. I WAS NOT GIVEN A CHOICE AND I AM NOW ""PART OF A STUDY"".

NOTE: I HAVE NOT BEEN ASKED TO COME FOR ANY F/U VISITS, I HAVE NOT BEEN ASKED TO COMPETE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FORMS - 3- PRE-. EVEN THOUGH I HAVE CONTRACTED AN AUTO IMMUNE DISORDER. I HAVE HAD 2 BAD INFECTIONS. I HAVE NOT BEEN ASKED TO DO ANY KIND OF MRI TO DETERMINE IF PERHAPS A RUPTURE IS CAUSING MY DISORDER, OR IF A RUPTURE IS CAUSING MY INFECTIONS. GIVEN THIS IS A CLINICAL STUDY, I WOULD THINK THIS WOULD BE A NORMAL COURSE OF ACTION. IN 2008, I WENT TO MY DR DUE TO ISSUES WITH MY LEFT BREAST. IT WAS INFLAMED AND VERY RED. HE PRESCRIBED ANTIBIOTICS. AT THIS TIME IT WAS MENTIONED THAT I HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH THE AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE, BUT NOTHING WAS WRITTEN DOWN THAT I SAW, I WAS NOT ASKED TO COMPLETE FORM 3 PRE FOR QUAL OF LIFE -AS DETAILED IN THE FDA'S DOCUMENTATION-. THERE WAS NO MRI TAKEN. I WILL NOTE THAT I HAD BEEN HOSPITALIZED, DUE TO CELLULITIS IN THE PREVIOUS MONTH, SO PERHAPS THE THOUGHT WAS THAT MY INFECTION IN MY BREAST WAS A RESULT OF THE PREVIOUS INFECTION. HOWEVER, MY EXPECTATION GIVEN THE FACT THAT I AM IN A CLINICAL STUDY, AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT I HAD TOLD DR WEISER THAT I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH THE DISORDER, WOULD LEAD ME TO BELIEVE THAT FURTHER DATA GATHERING AND ANALYSIS WOULD START TAKING PLACE. SIX MONTHS LATER, I CAME DOWN WITH YET ANOTHER INFECTION. I HAD ALSO BEEN DIAGNOSED EARLIER IN THE YEAR WITH MIXED CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDER IN ADDITION TO THE ELEVATED ANA, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS OVERLAPPING IMMUNE DISORDER. DR WEISER AGAIN ORDERED ANTIBIOTICS. WHEN TOLD ABOUT THE LUPUS - HIGH ANA- DR STATED ""THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT IMPLANTS CAUSE LUPUS"". AGAIN, I WAS NOT GIVEN THE QUAL OF LIFE FORM TO COMPLETE, I WAS NOT ASKED FOR MY RHEUMATOLOGIST'S NAME, THERE WAS NO SCRIPT TO MY RHEUMY TO DO ANY ADD'L TEST FOR SILICONE ANTIBODIES, FOR SILICONE IN THE BLOOD, OR TO OBTAIN COPIES OF MY BLOOD WORK TO PUT IN MY FILE. AND, THERE WAS NO MRI ORDERED. I WAS NOT ASKED TO COME BACK AFTER THE VISIT - EXCEPT FOR POST SURGICAL F/U, I AM NEVER COMMUNICATED WITH OR NEVER HAVE F/U VISITS SCHEDULED. THE FOLLOWING MONTH, I CALLED MY DR. TO LET THEM KNOW THAT I WANTED MY IMPLANTS REMOVED -EXPLANTED-. AGAIN, THERE WAS NO ORDER OF AN MRI BEFORE REMOVAL. I HAVE MY APPOINTMENT WITH THE DR THE FOLLOWING MONTH, AND THE REMOVAL IS SCHEDULED FOR EIGHT DAYS LATER. GIVEN THE SCHEDULING OF SUCH PROCEDURES, I WOULD THINK THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TOLD ME TO GET AN MRI. THERE AGAIN WAS NO REQUEST FOR BLOOD WORK FROM MY RHEUMATOLOGIST, OR A SCRIPT FOR ANY ADD'L BLOOD WORK. AGAIN - THERE WAS NO REQUEST TO COME IN AND COMPLETE THE QUAL OF LIFE FORM. I AM SOMEWHAT UPSET. WHEN DR. WEISER STATED ""THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT IMPLANTS CAUSE LUPUS"" MY FIRST THOUGHT NOW IS, WELL IF THE DRS ARE NOT REPORTING ANYTHING, NO WONDER THERE IS NO EVIDENCE. IF IT WERE NOT FOR ME FORCING THE ISSUE. I INTEND TO MAKE A REQUEST FOR MY MEDICAL FILE TO SEE WHAT IS BEING REPORTED MONTHLY, AND I INTEND TO SPEAK WITH AN ATTORNEY BECAUSE IF THIS IS HOW ""CLINICAL TRIALS"" ARE CONDUCTED, THEN THIS IS A FARCE, AND WOMEN ARE SUFFERING. THE MOCKERY ABOUT THE AUTO IMMUNE DISORDER AND LACK OF PROOF IN PARTICULAR IS WHAT MAKES ME MOST ANGRY, I AM LIVING PROOF. I AM TAKING THE LEAD TO ASK MY RHEUMATOLOGIST TO CONDUCT FURTHER TESTING, AND ASKING MY ONCOLOGIST TO ORDER THE MRI. I AM BEING MY OWN ADVOCATE, AND HOPEFULLY WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE INFO THAT IS USEFUL. COMMON SENSE SAYS: SILICONE IS A TOXIN USED IN PESTICIDES AND WAS CONSIDERED FOR CHEMICAL WARFARE BY DOW. DOW DIDN'T COVER UP A NUMBER OF FINDINGS BECAUSE THEY FELT SILICONE WAS SAFE. ALL OF THE CYA AND VOLUNTARY FORMS DO NOT TAKE AWAY THE FACT THAT SILICONE IS A TOXIN THAT CAUSES HARM TO THE BODY."|INAMED CORPORATION STYLE 410 SILICONE-FILLED BREAST||11/24/2008||||Y|||0HP|FTR|1.0||GUMMY BEAR IMPLANT|||||||INAMED CORP|||||||True

885245|19252514|D|1||"I RECEIVED THE SILICON ""GUMMY BEAR"" BREAST IMPLANTS IN 2005. THE FIRST PROBLEM THAT NO ONE HAD ADVISED ME ABOUT, IS THAT UPON WAKING UP FROM SURGERY, AND FROM THEN ON, THERE IS A REAL REDUCTION OF THE MUSCLES IN MY ARMS, GIVING A MUCH WEAKER ARMS MOBILITY AND CONTROL, AFFECTING DRIVING, LIFTING ETC. THEN AT ABOUT FOUR WEEKS LATER AFTER THE SURGERY I STARTED TO HAVE STRONG SHOOTING PAIN IN MY WRISTS AND FEET AND KNEES. I FELT OFTEN TIRED AND ALSO GOT SICK EASILY. I STARTED TO GET OUT OF BED USING KNUCKLES AND CLOSED FIST TO PUSH UP -TO REDUCE THE PAIN- AS TO AVOID PUTTING PRESSURE ON MY PAINFUL WRISTS. THEN IT STARTED TO BE A PROBLEM TO WORK OUT AT THE GYM BECAUSE OF THE PAIN IN THE BOWL OF THE FOOT, AND TO STAY IN CLASS FOR LONG HOURS. I WAS WORKING AS A TEACHER. IN 2006, I STARTED TO HAVE ASTHMA THAT WAS VERY DISTURBING AT NIGHT, THEN COUGH, AND APNEA EPISODES AND HAD TO TAKE TIME OFF WORK AND MORE MEDICAL EXPENSES. AT ABOUT ONE MONTH LATER, I HAD A STAPH INFECTION ON MY NECK THAT REQUIRED A SHOT AT THE EMERGENCY ROOM, BECAUSE I HAD CHEST PRESSURE AND COULDN'T BREATHE WELL. THE STAPH SKIN INFECTION TOOK TWO ROUNDS OF ANTIBIOTICS TO CLEAR. SINCE 2005, I ALSO EXPERIENCED RASHES ON MY CHESTS THAT I NEVER HAD BEFORE. THE RED PATCHES-RASHES HAVE DIFFERENT SHAPES, SOMETIMES GEOMETRIC SOMETIMES THE SIZE OF A SNAIL, AND THEY COME AND GO WITHIN TWO TO FIVE DAYS, AND I WEAR NECK HIGH SHIRTS, MAKING IT VERY UNCOMFORTABLE IN THIS HEAT. I ALSO NOTICED A DRAMATIC CHANGE IN THE SHAPE AND COLOR OF THE MOLES ON MY SKIN -MIGRATION, DARKER- AND MY SKIN SENSITIVITY, WITH SOME PARTS OF MY SKIN FEELING NUMB OR LESS SENSITIVE AROUND MY CHEST AND ARMS. THE DERMATOLOGIST I CONSULTED DIDN'T IDENTIFY THEM WITH A PARTICULAR TREATMENT BUT TRIED TO SELL ME SEVERAL LASER REJUVENATING TREATMENTS. EACH DOCTOR I CONSULTED IN THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF TOLD ME THAT MY SYMPTOMS WERE UNLIKELY RELATED TO THE SILICON IMPLANTS BECAUSE THE FDA REPORTED THEM SAFE AND THERE WOULD BE NO FURTHER QUESTION ABOUT IT. I CONSULTED MANY DOCTORS, AND RAN MANY BLOOD AND URINE TESTS, HIPS AND HANDS X-RAYS, IMPLANTS X-RAYS, CHIROPRACTOR SESSIONS, ACUPUNCTURE, ""AYURVEDIC"" -OUT OF FRUSTRATION- BUT NOTHING HAS RELIEVED ME FROM THE SHOOTING PAIN. THE BLOOD TESTS RESULTS DIDN'T SHOW ANY INFLAMMATION IN MY SYSTEM. PAIN COMES AND GOES, AND ACUPUNCTURE HELPS ONLY FOR A SHORT TIME. AT NIGHT I WAKE UP, COMPLETE AWAKE SOMETIMES AT 2AM OR 4AM AND CANNOT GO BACK TO SLEEP, AND USE THE RESTROOM SEVERAL TIMES AT NIGHT, UNABLE TO GET A COMPLETE EMPTYING FEELING, WITH A SLOW FLOW, WHICH IS ALSO SOMETHING I NEVER DEALT WITH BEFORE. I HAVE SHOOTING PAIN IN MY KNEES AND HIPS, AND SOMETIMES SMALL BONES TOES AS IF A METAL PIN WAS SHOVED WITH FORCE. I HAVE CONSULTED A LOCAL SURGEON ABOUT ONE MONTH LATER, WHO TOLD ME THAT HE'D HELP ME REMOVE THE IMPLANTS BUT I DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCE TO PAY FOR SURGERY. THE NEW SURGEON I CONSULTED RECENTLY SAID THAT HE PERFORMED ALREADY ABOUT 300 EXPLANTATIONS ""EN BLOC"" AND THAT THE WOMEN PRESENTED HEALTH COMPLAINTS SIMILAR TO MINE WITH 2/3 SUCCESS RATE OF HEALTH REVERSAL TO COMPLETE GOOD HEALTH AS THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY TO THE IMPLANTS INSERTION. AT AN URGENT CARE AT ONE VERY PAINFUL EVENT, I WAS PRESCRIBED PAIN KILLERS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS, AS THERE ARE NO TESTS FOR MIGRATING SILICON. I HAVE NOT TAKEN THE ANTIDEPRESSANTS AS IT IS NOT GOING TO ALLEVIATE THE PAIN IN MY JOINTS, GIVING MY SIGHT BACK, ALLEVIATE MY FINGER BONES PAIN AND NUMBNESS OR GIVE ME MY HEALTH AND STRENGTH BACK. SINCE 2007, THINGS SEEM TO HAVE PRECIPITATED WITH MY HEALTH, ADDING TO THE PREVIOUS PROBLEMS. BECAUSE I WAS ALWAYS FEELING SO TIRED, AND NOT GETTING ENOUGH REST AND WAKING UP AT NIGHT, I DECIDED TO LEAVE MY TEACHING POSITION AND WORK FROM HOME AND HAVE A SLOWER PACE AND GET MORE REST WHEN I NEED IT. I HAVE NEW SYMPTOMS SINCE 2007 AS FOLLOW: MY FINGER TIPS ARE NUMB AND I HAVE CHEST PAIN WHEN I BREATHE, ESPECIALLY WHEN I AM LAYING IN BED, AND MY LOWER LEGS AND TOES GET NUMB WHICH MAKE ME WANT TO MOVE AROUND AND CHANGE POSITION AS TO HELP MY BODY BLOOD CIRCULATION. I HAVE NEW BURNING SENSATION PATCHES ON MY ARMS THAT ALSO SEEM TO COME AND GO. WHEN I TAKE A DEEP BREATH MY BACKBONE EXTENDS AND MAKES A LOUD POPPING SOUND. IT'S QUIET SCARY, ESPECIALLY WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING. I HAVE SORES IN MY MOUTHS THAT COME AND GO BETWEEN TWO MONTHS IN 2007, AND NOW MY VISION IS SUDDENLY BLURRY, I CANNOT READ WELL REGULAR PRINT CLOSE OR DISTANT. IT'S REALLY SCARY. ALTHOUGH THE SCARIEST PART IS THAT MY SKELETON IS PERFORMING DIFFERENTLY. THE JOINTS IN HIPS AND KNEES, HANDS, FINGERS, AND TOES STARTED ACTING UP, BUT IN THE LAST FOUR MONTHS IT PRECIPITATED TO ALL THE OTHER ONES WITH A LOUD POPPING SOUND, IN MY BACK ESPECIALLY, MANDIBLE, SHOULDERS, AND THE NECK -MAKES A WHOOSHING SOUND.- I HAVE PUT ON 15 POUNDS SINCE RECEIVING THE IMPLANTS, AND I AM UNABLE TO GO THE GYM AS I USED TO OR TO RUN ANY LONGER BECAUSE OF PAIN IN FEET, TOES, AND KNEES. LOOKING BACK AT THIS ONE YEAR AND A HALF I HAVE SPENT 35-45% OF MY WORKING TIME MEETING DOCTORS, MANAGING THE SHOOTING PAIN, DOING REPETITIVE AND INCONCLUSIVE LAB TESTS, TAKING LONG NAPS, DEALING WITH SLEEP INTERRUPTION AND URINE AND KIDNEY TRACK PROBLEM SOLVING, AND SEARCHING FOR FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THE ONLY PROBLEM THAT IS VERY EVIDENT, THE SILICON -GUMMY BEAR- IN MY BREASTS IMPLANTS ARE MAKING ME VERY SICK."|GUMMY BEARS||07/20/2007||||N|||0|FTR|1.0||BREAST IMPLANTS|||||||nan|||||||True

SURGERY WAS UNEVENTFUL, I HAD HUGE SWELLING UPPER LEFT BREAST AREA POST SURGERY. I WAS DISCHARGED THE NEXT DAY WITH 2 BREAST DRAINS AND INSTRUCTED TO FOLLOW-UP WITH SURGEON. I FOLLOWED UP WITH MY PLASTIC SURGEON AT LEAST TWICE A WEEK. BREAST SURGERY WAS VERY PAINFUL. ON THIRD WEEK POST-SURGERY, I HAD SEVERAL MEDICAL COMPLAINTS: HEADACHE, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, NUMBNESS OF FACE, AND EVENTUALLY MOTTLING, REDNESS AND SWELLING OF LEFT BREAST, SWELLING ON PORT BELOW INTRA-MAMMARY FOLD. I HAD SEVERAL VISITS TO URGENT CARE, EMERGENCY HOSPITAL, AND DOCTORS' OFFICES. I DEVELOPED FEVER AND CELLULITIS ON BREAST; WHICH FELT LIKE A BALLOON. I WENT TO URGENT CARE ON (B)(6) 2012; WAS GIVEN VANCOMYCIN IV. THE NEXT DAY, I FELT THAT THE LEFT BREAST DEFLATED AND AREA AROUND PORT (INTRA-MAMMARY FOLD) FILLED WITH MORE FLUID. I SAW MY SURGEON WHO ORDERED ADMISSION TO HOSPITAL FOR SURGICAL EXPLANTATION, IRRIGATION, AND DEBRIDEMENT. SURGERY WAS PERFORMED ON THE NEXT DAY, (B)(6) 2012. CLOUDY SEROMA AND GRANULATION TISSUE WAS EVACUATED AND SALINE BREAST EXPANDER AND PORT WAS REMOVED. SAMPLES OF FLUID AND TISSUE WERE SUBMITTED FOR CULTURE AND SENSITIVITY TESTING, BUT NO HISTOPATHOLOGICAL SAMPLES WERE TAKEN. SHE SAID THAT THE IMPLANT WILL BE SUBMITTED FOR EXAMINATION AND THEN RETURNED TO MFR. I WAS GIVEN CONTINUOUS VANCOMYCIN TREATMENT FOR 2 DAYS AND WAS PRESCRIBED CIPRO AND ORAL PAIN MEDS. I HAD FOLLOW-UP VISITS AT HER OFFICE AND 2 DRAIN TUBES WERE REMOVED AFTER SEVERAL DAYS. THE INITIAL CULTURE TEST RESULTS AT (B)(6) CAME OUT AS ACID-FAST BACILLI, A FAST GROWER. I SAW AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR FOR EMPIRICAL TREATMENT WHILE WAITING FOR SENSITIVITY TESTING RESULTS. I STARTED WITH A COMBINATION TREATMENT OF CLARITHROMYCIN AND DOXYCYCLINE. THE TREATMENT WAS CONCURRED BY MY CURRENT INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR AT (B)(6) HOSPITAL. THE SAMPLE WAS SENT TO (B)(6) FOR FURTHER IDENTIFICATION AND SENSITIVITY TESTING. RESULTS OF THE TEST IDENTIFIED AS M. FORTUITUM, SENSITIVE TO CLARITHROMYCIN, BUT RESISTANT TO DOXYCYCLINE. MY INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR, REPLACED THE DOXYCYCLINE TO CIPRO IN COMBINATION WITH CLARITHROMYCIN. I FINALLY CONSULTED WITH (B)(6); WELL KNOWN EXPERTS IN DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF MYCOBACTERIAL INFECTIONS. I WANTED TO GET A ""DEFINITE REGARDING CAUSE"" OF PERSISTENT FIBRINOUS NODULAR TISSUE ON MY LEFT BREAST AND AXILLA. I FINALLY SAW AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR, WHO THEN PRESENTED MY CASE FOR REVIEW AT THEIR DEPARTMENT STAFF MEETING. ASSESSMENT WAS POSSIBLE MYCOBACTERIUM FORTUITUM IATROGENIC HEALTH CARE ASSOCIATED INFECTION OF THE LEFT BREAST IMPLANT. BECAUSE OF ABSENCE OF PERI-OPERATIVE PATHOLOGY TO LOOK FOR GRANULOMAS, NOR ABILITY TO RE-CULTURE THE SITE, PLAN WAS TO GET MRI OF RESIDUAL BREAST TISSUE AND CONSULT WITH SURGEON WHO SPECIALIZED IN MYCOBACTERIAL INFECTIONS. MRI RESULTS: SOME ABNORMAL FINDINGS, BUT COULD NOT RULE OUT IF THIS IS DUE TO INFECTIOUS DISEASE OR POST-SURGICAL CHANGES. I SAW A SURGEON AT (B)(6). SHE CONCURRED WITH (B)(6) TREATMENT OF 6 MONTHS ANTIBIOTICS AND RETURN APPOINTMENT FOR REASSESSMENT IN 3 MONTHS. ANTIBIOTIC COMBINATION WERE PRESCRIBED, CHANGED FROM TIME TO TIME TO PREVENT BACTERIAL RESISTANCE AND SIDE EFFECTS. ON THE LAST FEW WEEKS OF TREATMENT, I WAS SWITCHED TO TAKING SULFISOXAZOLE/TRIMETHOPRIM ALONE BECAUSE I WAS NOT ABLE TO TOLERATE THE SIDE EFFECTS FROM AVELOX, CIPRO, ETC. ON (B)(6) 2012, I HAD A RETURN DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT AND MRI AND BLOOD TEST AT (B)(6). SURGEON'S ASSESSMENT WAS THAT I HAVE NO APPARENT LESION OF MYCOBACTERIAL DISEASE. MY INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR WITHDREW ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT ON (B)(6). I STARTED HAVING STOMACH PAINS RIGHT AFTER I WITHDREW MY ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT. THE PAIN CONTINUED AND SPREAD ON THE ABDOMEN SPECIALLY ON THE LEFT LOWER QUADRANT. MY OBGYN DOCTOR PERFORMED ENDOMETRIAL BIOPSY WHICH RESULT WAS NEGATIVE. MY GASTROENTEROLOGIST ALSO PERFORMED COLONOSCOPY LAST WEEK AND AWAITING FOR RESULTS OF THE BIOPSY. HE SUGGESTED BREATH TEST TO RULE OUT SIBO. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF I GET AN IMPROVEMENT FROM THE COLON CLEANSING BEFORE I SCHEDULE TESTING. I AM CURRENTLY TAKING PROBIOTICS AND PANTOPRAZOLE 40 MG DAILY AND I HAVE SEEN IMPROVEMENT SINCE COLONOSCOPY."|BREAST IMPLANT EXPANDER/SMOOTH ROUND SPECTRUM SALINE||12/11/2012||||R|||0HP|FWM|1.0||SALINE BREAST IMPLANT (EXPANDER)||6503382|201 MENTOR DR||SANTA BARBARA|US|MENTOR CORP|93111|CA|93111||REF 350-1480||True

2674277|16325445|N|1||"A REPORT WAS MADE TO MENTOR BY THE EXPLANTING PHYSICIAN THAT THIS PT WAS EXPERIENCING SYMPTOMS OF MS (NUMBNESS IN LEGS AND DIFFICULTY WALKING) SINCE HER DEFLATION IN (B)(6) 2005. THE PT WAS RE-IMPLANTED AT THAT TIME WITH MENTOR SALINE-FILLED MAMMARY PROSTHESES. SHE HAS ALSO PRESENTED WITH A RIGHT DEFLATION. SINCE REMOVING THESE DEVICES, THE PT'S SYMPTOMS HAVE SUBSIDED AND THE PT CAN WALK. BECAUSE THE LEFT PROSTHESIS INVOLVED IN THIS COMPLAINT WILL NOT BE RETURNED TO MENTOR, PE WAS PRECLUDED FROM EVALUATING THE DEVICE. BASED ON THE LABORATORY EVAL, PE CONCLUDED THE RIGHT DEFLATION WAS MOST LIKELY DUE TO THE RENT THAT MEASURED APPROX .1 CM IN LENGTH, WITHIN THE CREASE, ON THE POSTERIOR ASPECT OF THE DEVICE. A MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION OF THE EDGES OF THE RENT REVEALED A TAPERED WEAR PATTERN. TAPER WEAR IS CHARACTERISTIC OF A CREASE/FOLD FAILURE. A CREASE/FOLD FAILURE IS A KNOWN INHERENT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF SALINE-FILLED MAMMARY PROSTHESES AND MAY BE THE RESULT OF ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: UNDERINFLATION OR OVERINFLATION OF THE DEVICE, CONTINUOUS AND SUSTAINED STRESSES TO THE DEVICE - SUCH AS CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR TOO SMALL A BREAST POCKET, AND FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE SHELL IN THE BREAST POCKET. LEAK TESTING OF THE DEVICE REVEALED NO OTHER LEAKAGE SITES. BECAUSE THE RISK OF DEVICE DEFLATION CANNOT BE ELIMINATED, MENTOR ADDRESSES THIS RISK IN THE PIDS BY STATING THAT THESE DEVICES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED LIFETIME DEVICES. THE MENTOR MICROBIOLOGY DEPT ASSURES THE STERILITY OF DEVICES INDICATING THAT THEY MEET ALL STERILIZATION PARAMETERS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A 10E-6 STERILITY ASSURANCE LEVEL PRIOR TO RELEASE FOR DISTRIBUTION. PE CONCLUDED THE REPORTED INFECTION IN THE PT'S BREAST OCCURRED FROM A SOURCE OTHER THAN THE DEVICES. INFECTION IS A KNOWN COMPLICATION ASSOCIATED WITH ANY SURGERY AND IS REFERENCED IN OUR CURRENT PRODUCT INSERT DATA SHEET. THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE (IOM) OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCE RELEASED A FINAL REPORT STATING ""A REVIEW OF SEVENTEEN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL REPORTS OF CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS WAS REMARKABLE FOR ITS CONSISTENCY IN FINDING NO ELEVATED RISKS OR ODDS RATIO FOR AN ASSOCIATION OF IMPLANTS WITH DISEASE...THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT SILICONE IMPLANTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY MAJOR DISEASE OF THE WHOLE BODY. WOMEN ARE EXPOSED TO SILICONE CONSTANTLY IN THEIR DAILY LIVES. THERE IS NO PLAUSIBLE EVIDENCE OF A NOVEL AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE CAUSED BY IMPLANTS."" BASED ON THESE REPORTS, PE IS UNABLE TO CONFIRM THAT THE REPORTED COMPLAINTS ARE DEVICE RELATED; HOWEVER, MENTOR CONTINUES TO INCLUDE EXTENSIVE DISCUSSIONS ON ALLEGED SILICONE RESPONSES IN ITS PRODUCT INSERT DATA SHEETS SO THAT THE PT AND PHYSICIAN ARE FULLY INFORMED OF ANY POTENTIAL RISKS.

INFECTION LEVELS DROPPED SOME, STILL VERY ILL AND SKIN ON BREAST WAS REDDER, MORE HARD, AND VERY PAINFUL. AT WEEK 8, NOTICED SOME DISCHARGE FROM NIPPLE WHERE THE STITCHES HAD BEEN. I WENT TO PLASTIC SURGEON, HE MADE A SMALL HOLE, FLUID CAME GUSHING OUT. HE SAID THE IMPLANT WAS ON TOP AND WAS VISIBLE, RATHER THAN UNDER THE MUSCLE; IT WAS PUSHING ITS' WAY OUT. SCHEDULED THE SURGERY OF EXPLANT OF THE LEFT SIDE IN WHICH I HAD THE INFECTION. MY RIGHT BREST APPEARED FINE, NO PAIN OR REDNESS, STITCHES NORMAL ON THE RIGHT SIDE. IN DOING A CULTURE OF THE TISSUE, IT WAS DETERMINED THE INFECTION WAS CAUSED BY MYCOBACTERIUM FORTUITUM. WHEN THE INFECTIOUS DISEASE DR. INFORMED ME OF WHAT THIS WAS, HE SAID IT WAS VERY RARE IN THE US. HE HAD ONLY SEEN THIS INFECTION ONCE BEFORE, 10 YRS. PRIOR ON A BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY ON SOMEONE WHO HAD BEEN IN THE MARINES. I THEN STARTED THE ANTIBIOTIC CLARITHROMYCIN FOR ANOTHER 4 WEEKS. THE DR. HAS FELT THAT A PROTOCOL SOMEWHERE WAS MISSED AND BELIEVED WAS ON THE IMPLANT TO START. IN GATHERING SECOND OPINIONS, AS I WAS CONCERNED, GOING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL SURGEON, NUMEROUS COMMENTS FROM PLASTIC SURGEONS WERE THEY ASSUMED I HAD GONE OUT OF THE COUNTRY TO HAVE MY SURGERY. I HAVE NEVER BEEN OUT OF THE COUNTRY AND HAD SURGERY IN (B)(6). I CONTACTED THE COUNTY HEALTH DEPT., BUT THEY DON'T KEEP RECORD OR REPORT THIS TYPE OF BACTERIA I WAS TOLD. CURRENTLY HAVE DISFIGURED LEFT SIDE DUE TO LOTS OF TISSUE DAMAGE AND LOTS OF SCAR TISSUE. SIENTRA - LEFT SIDE (INFECTED SIDE) (B)(4), SERIAL #(B)(4) SMOOTH ROUND, MP ON (B)(6), WAS AT A PLASTIC SURGEONS OFFICE FOR A CONSULTATION. HE MENTIONED HE HOPED THAT SIENTRA IMPLANTS WOULD BE BACK AVAILABLE IN THE SPRING OF 2016 TO HIS NURSE. THIS MADE ME CURIOUS AS I HAD NOT HEARD THEY WERE OFF MARKET. SAW AN ARTICLE FROM (B)(6) 2015, THAT THERE WERE SOME PROBLEMS WITH PLANT IN (B)(6). I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO REPORT SINCE THE INFECTION MAY HAVE COME FROM THIS PLANT; WOULD NOT WANT PEOPLE TO GO THROUGH THE LAST FEW MONTHS OF WHAT I DID AND THE RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY YET TO COME. I HAVE ASKED THE ORIGINAL DOCTOR A FEW TIMES IF HE REPORTS TO SIENTRA THE LOT NUMBER AS I WAS CURIOUS IF ANYONE ELSE EXPERIENCED THESE PROBLEMS, HE SAID NO, AS IF IT WASN'T SOMETHING TO REPORT TO THEM.

APPROXIMATELY 2 YEARS LATER THE FDA APPROVED THIS STYLE IMPLANT AND THE STUDY WAS ENDED. ON (B)(6) 2016 MY RIGHT BREAST BECAME TIGHT AND HARD. IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS IT BECAME LARGER AND LARGER.

SHE ORDERED AN ANTIBIOTIC AND MADE AN APPOINTMENT FOR ME TO SEE HER THE FOLLOWING WEEK. I WENT TO SEE HER AND SHE TOOK MORE PICTURES AND TOLD ME IT WAS PROBABLY AN INFECTION AND I SHOULD CONTINUE ANTIBIOTIC. MY BREAST GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER AND MY SURGEON DECIDED TO REMOVE MY IMPLANT. DURING THE SURGERY SHE TOOK A TISSUE SAMPLE AND THEN PUT IN A NEW TEXTURED IMPLANT AND CLOSED UP INCISION. ON (B)(6), THE PATHOLOGY REPORT CAME BACK WITH THE DIAGNOSIS OF ALCL. IT WAS CONFIRMED BY A PET CT SCAN. MY SURGEON SAID THAT SHE KNEW THE DOCTOR WHO SPECIALIZED IN ALCL AND THAT HE WAS AT THE (B)(6).

WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.""

THIS BACTERIA DOES NOT SHOW UP ON STANDARD LAB TESTS, AND THE ONLY WAY FOR ME TO TELL OF INFECTION WAS REMOVAL.

STILL UNSURE WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH MY BODY, THE PAIN AND LUMPS AROUND MY BREASTS AND ARMPITS ONLY INCREASED. ALL OF MY PHYSICIANS AT THIS POINT WERE CLUELESS. THEY CHALKED IT UP TO HORMONES.

HOWEVER, WHAT WAS LURKING WAS STILL A HORRIBLE ILLNESS, ONE THAT WOULD SOON CONSUME EVERY PART OF ME. I BEGAN TO LOOSE MY HAIR IN HUGE CLUMPS. MY ONCE THICK MANE, QUICKLY THINNED AND BECAME BRITTLE. AGAIN, I THOUGHT OK, MY HORMONES ARE JUST REGULATING. BUT THEN CAME THE EXTREME BRAIN FOG, CONFUSION, NECK AND BACK PAIN, VISION DISTURBANCES, EYE TWITCH, MUSCLE SPASMS, FULL BODY FATIGUE, EAR PAIN/PRESSURE, HEADACHES, FOOD INTOLERANCES, ALCOHOL SENSITIVITY, MOODINESS, DEPRESSION. I USED TO BE ABLE TO DO A MILLION THINGS AT ONE TIME, (MON LIFE??), AND NOW I HAD TO TELL MY BRAIN ONE THING AT A TIME. I'D CONSTANTLY BE GOING IN CIRCLES, FORGETTING WHAT I HAD JUST TOLD MYSELF OUT LOUD 10 SECONDS PRIOR. IT WAS EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING. EVERYDAY TASKS BECAME HARD TO ACCOMPLISH. I WAS EXISTING, GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS, BUT SO FAR FROM ""LIVING"". BLOOD WORK DONE, AND NOTHING. I BELIEVE THAT WAS THE DEPRESSING PART. FEELING LIKE I WAS SLOWLY DYING AND NOT SURE WHERE TO TURN FOR HELP. ALL OF THE DOCTORS KEPT TELLING ME I WAS HEALTHY. AFTER MOVING TO (B)(6), I SOUGHT HELP IN INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE. I SAW A NATUROPATH, WHO DID MORE BLOOD WORK. ALMOST ALL LOOKING IN MODERATE RANGE, AGAIN. HOWEVER, I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ADRENAL FATIGUE, TOXIC OVERLOAD AND VITAMIN DEFICIENCY. I WAS PUT ON NATURAL SUPPLEMENTS AND HERBS, ALONG WITH A NATURAL DIET FILLED WITH ORGANIC FOODS. COMBINING THAT WITH ACUPUNCTURE AND CHIROPRACTIC CARE, AFTER FOUR MONTHS I STARTED TO SEE MORE GOOD DAYS THAN BAD. BUT STILL NOT FEELING LIKE MYSELF, I KEPT SEARCHING. I HAVE BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESS, AND ONE DAY YOU WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT."|MCGHAN SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS||08/21/2016||||*|*||I|FWM|2.0||MCGHAN SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS||623444|||||ALLERGAN|||||68HP-550||True
5900555|53035399|D|1||"TWO YEARS AGO I BEGAN TO HAVE LUMPS AND PAIN IN MY BREASTS AND ARM PITS. EVERY DOCTOR TOLD ME THERE WAS NO WAY THIS COULD BE MY IMPLANTS. THEY WERE EXTREMELY WRONG. I HAD TO PAY FOR REMOVAL AND TESTING OF IMPLANTS AND TISSUE. THEY FOUND PROPIONIBACTERIUM. THIS BACTERIA DOES NOT SHOW UP ON STANDARD LAB TESTS, AND THE ONLY WAY FOR ME TO TELL OF INFECTION WAS REMOVAL. HERE'S MY STORY, TWO YEARS AGO, ON A BEAUTIFUL, SUNNY (B)(6) DAY, I WOKE UP TO A HUGE LUMP UNDER MY ARMPIT. IT COULD BARELY LIFT MY KIDS WITHOUT EXTREME PAIN. MY HYPOCHONDRIAC SELF WAS PRAYING IT WASN'T ANYTHING SERIOUS. THAT'S WHEN I BELIEVE IT ALL BEGAN. WHAT MY PRIMARY DOCTOR LABELED AS AN ENLARGED LYMPH NODE FROM AN INFECTED HAIR FOLLICLE SOON ASPIRATED TO WHAT I NOW BELIEVE WAS THE BEGINNING OF MY BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESS. ONE MONTH LATER, WE WERE SURPRISED TO FIND OUT WE WERE PREGNANT WITH OUR 3RD BABY, OUR SWEET (B)(6).

5821949|50447305|D|1||A (B)(6) WOMAN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS ADMITTED TO OUR DEPARTMENT, DUE TO SUDDEN UNILATERAL RIGHT BREAST ENLARGEMENT AND DISCOMFORT. BREAST AUGMENTATION WAS DONE 11 YEARS PREVIOUSLY WITH SUBGLANDULAR PLACEMENT OF ALLERGAN TEXTURIZED PROSTHESES THROUGH THE INFRAMAMMARY APPROACH. THE BREAST AUGMENTATION WAS DONE ELSEWHERE. DESPITE OUR EFFORTS TO GET INFO ABOUT THE IMPLANT FROM THE PLASTIC SURGEON THAT HAD IMPLANTED THE DEVICE, WE HAVE NO SERIAL NUMBER OR PRODUCT CODE. THE PT HAD NO FURTHER INFO. AN ULTRASOUND AND MAMMOGRAPHY IMAGES WHICH WERE DONE 4 MONTHS EARLIER WERE NORMAL. THE WOMAN DENIED ANY HISTORY OF BREAST TRAUMA, PRODROMAL ILLNESS, PAIN, PURULENT DRAINAGE, LOCAL SIGN OF INFECTION, NIGHT SWEATS, WEIGHT LOSS, POOR APPETITE OR FEVER. AT PHYSICAL EXAMINATION BREAST ASYMMETRY WAS OBVIOUS. THE RIGHT BREAST WAS SWOLLEN, FIRM AND SENSITIVE TO DEEP PALPATION. THE LEFT BREAST WAS NORMAL. NO SIGN OF LOCAL INFECTION WERE OBSERVED. IN (B)(6) 2015, AN ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA WAS FOUND IN THE PERIPROSTHETIC FLUID AND FIBRINOID DEPOSITS WITHIN THE PERIPROSTHETIC CAPSULE, OF THE RIGHT BREAST. THE LEFT BREAST WAS WITHOUT ANY CLINICAL, LAB, IMAGING OR HISTOPATHOLOGICAL EVIDENCE OF DISEASE. ON (B)(6) 2015, THE PT UNDERWENT BILATERAL TOTAL CAPSULECTOMY AND IMPLANT REMOVAL. NOW, MORE THAN A YEAR AFTER, THE PT IS DISEASE FREE. CT PET SCANS, INCLUDING A RECENT SCAN, DO NOT SHOW ANY SIGNS OF THE LYMPHOMA.|ALLERGAN SILICONE TEXTURED BREAST IMPLANT||07/24/2016||||Y|*||0HP|FTR|1.0||ALLERGAN SILICONE TEXTURED BREAST IMPLANT|||||||ALLERGAN|||||||True
