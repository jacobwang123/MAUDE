FILL INSPECTION NOTED NO BLOCKAGE IN THE VALVE. MICROSCOPIC ANALYSIS ASSESSED THE DEVICE AS INTACT AND FUNCTIONAL WITH NO OPENINGS FOUND IN THE DEVICE. THE EVENT OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, BAKER GRADE IV, IS A PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATION AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THIS EVENT. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE EVENT, PRODUCT, OR PATIENT DETAILS WAS REQUESTED; NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE. DEVICE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, ASYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. DEFLATION Â¿ BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS DEFLATE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. DEFLATION CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO DEFLATE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS; FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL; EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED); TRAUMA; COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING; AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF DEFLATION FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT; HOWEVER, IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF DEFLATION. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER THESE ADDITIONAL SURGERIES.

6732140|80678267|N|1||FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTER REGARDING RETURN OF THE DEVICE HAS BEEN REQUESTED. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. DEVICE LABELING: SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANTS ARE PRONE TO UNINTENDED INSTRUMENT TRAUMA DURING IMPLANTATION OR DURING EXPLANTATION. NUMBER 1, 2 SHELL FAILURE CAN RESULT FROM DAMAGE BY SCALPELS, SUTURE NEEDLES, HYPODERMIC NEEDLES, HEMOSTATS, AND ADSON FORCEPS AND HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN EXPLANTED DEVICE SHELLS USING SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY. ALLERGANÂ¿S (RETRIEVAL STUDY) ANALYSES OF EXPLANTED DEVICES HAVE IDENTIFIED UNINTENDED SURGICAL INSTRUMENT DAMAGE AS ONE POTENTIAL CAUSE OF SHELL FAILURE AND THUS IMPLANT RUPTURE. THE PATIENT SHOULD BE TOLD THAT THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGE IN THE IMPLANT SHAPE MAY BE SIGNS OF SYMPTOMATIC RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. IF THE PATIENT HAS ANY OF THESE SIGNS, SHE SHOULD BE TOLD TO REPORT THEM AND POSSIBLY HAVE AN MRI EVALUATION TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. BREAST IMPLANTS RUPTURE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. RUPTURES CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO RUPTURE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, STRESSING THE IMPLANT DURING IMPLANTATION AND WEAKENING IT, FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL, EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED), TRAUMA, COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING, AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF RUPTURE FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT. IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF RUPTURE. LABORATORY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RUPTURE ARE ONGOING. SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SEE TABLE 3 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING MRI SCREENING. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE. IF RUPTURE OCCURS, SILICONE GEL MAY EITHER REMAIN WITHIN THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), MOVE OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE (EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), OR MOVE OUTSIDE THE BREAST (GEL MIGRATION). THERE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY THAT RUPTURE MAY PROGRESS FROM INTRACAPSULAR TO EXTRACAPSULAR AND BEYOND. IN ALLERGANÂ¿S CORE STUDY, THERE WAS A MRI SCREENING COHORT WHO HAD REGULAR MRIS TO SCREEN FOR BREAST IMPLANT RUPTURE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE SYMPTOMATIC (I.E., MRI COHORT) AND A NON-MRI SCREENING COHORT WHO WERE NOT SCREENED WITH BREAST IMPLANT MRIS (I.E., NON-MRI COHORT). THE RUPTURE RATES IN THE MRI COHORTS WERE 9.3% FOR PRIMARY AUGMENTATION, 5.4% FOR REVISION-AUGMENTATION, 35.4% FOR PRIMARY RECONSTRUCTION, AND 0% FOR REVISION-RECONSTRUCTION. THE RUPTURE RATE FOR THE WHOLE MRI COHORT IN THE CORE STUDY (INCLUDING AUGMENTATION, REVISION-AUGMENTATION, RECONSTRUCTION, AND REVISION-RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS) THROUGH 10 YEARS WAS 13.0% FOR PATIENTS AND 7.7% FOR IMPLANTS. ACROSS ALL PATIENTS IN THE CORE STUDY, ALL RUPTURES WERE INTRACAPSULAR WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 3 CASES OF EXTRACAPSULAR GEL (ONE RUPTURE PROGRESSED TO EXTRACAPSULAR GEL FOLLOWING EXPLORATORY SURGERY TO CONFIRM THE RUPTURE AND THEN IMPLANT REPLACEMENT WAS DELAYED).|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|07/21/2017||||N|R||0HP|FWM|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||NI|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

DEVICE HISTORY RECORD REVIEW: REVIEW OF DHR FOR WORK ORDER 2183997 DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY DEVIATIONS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS OR NON-CONFORMANCES DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. ALL GEL BREAST IMPLANTS WERE REVIEWED AS PART OF THE ASSEMBLY OPERATIONS AND THESE TASKS WERE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO APPLICABLE CURRENT PROCEDURES TO ENSURE THAT ASSEMBLY MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. THE DHR ASSEMBLY REPORT FROM SAP WAS VERIFIED AND THERE WAS NO SCRAP RELATED WITH REPORTED EVENT, ALL DEVICES WERE CONFORMANCE DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION GATHERED DURING THE DHR REVIEW, THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT DEVICES FROM WORK ORDER 2183997 WERE ASSEMBLED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALLERGAN MEDICAL PROCEDURES AND SPECIFICATIONS. THE REPORTED DEVICE WAS INTACT AT THE TIME OF PRODUCTION AND MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. REPORTED EVENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN THE LABELING: PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENT. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. YOU SHOULD PERFORM SELF-EXAMINATION OF YOUR BREASTS EVERY MONTH FOR CANCER SCREENING. HOWEVER, THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU DISTINGUISH THE IMPLANT FROM YOUR BREAST TISSUE. THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGES IN IMPLANT SHAPE, MAY BE SIGNS OF A RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. THESE SIGNS SHOULD BE REPORTED TO YOUR SURGEON AND POSSIBLY EVALUATED WITH AN MRI. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.|INSPIRA TEXTURED SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|N-TRM445|05/10/2017||||N|R||0HP|FTR|1.0|10/11/2016|PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||2183997|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL.

THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT.

6498449|72963713|N|1||THIS REPORT IS SUBMITTED IN RESPONSE TO FDA NOTICE TITLED BREAST IMPLANT-ASSOCIATED ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (BIA-ALCL) PROVIDED ON 21/MAR/2017. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CASES REFERENCED IN THE NOTICE IS 359, INCLUDING 9 DEATHS. THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE NOTICE CLASSIFIES THE ALCL EVENTS IN DIFFERENT CATEGORIES, INCLUDING TYPES OF DEVICE, ASSOCIATED ADVERSE EVENTS, PRESENTATION, AND DIAGNOSIS DETAILS, BUT DOES NOT IDENTIFY SPECIFIC DEVICES OR PATIENTS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO INDIVIDUALIZE THIS INFORMATION INTO SPECIFIC REPORTS, AND BY DEFINITION ALREADY INCLUDES EVENTS REPORTED BY ALLERGAN IN THE PAST. THEREFORE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH 21 CFR 803, THIS REPORT WILL REPRESENT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF RECEIPT OF THE NOTICE AND DOCUMENTATION OF ALLERGAN'S ATTEMPT TO INVESTIGATE ADVERSE EVENTS IDENTIFIED IN THAT NOTICE. THIS REPORT WILL NOT SUBSTITUTE FOR ANY INVESTIGATION INTO COMPLAINTS RECEIVED WHERE INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS OR ALLERGAN DEVICES ARE IDENTIFIED, INCLUSIVE OR EXCLUSIVE OF THE 359 CASES MENTIONED IN THE NOTICE. (B)(4). THE EVENTS OF DEATH, LYMPHOMA-ALCL, LYMPHOMA, SEROMA, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, AND BREAST LUMPS ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THESE EVENTS. SALINE DEVICE LABELING: RADIATION TO THE BREAST Â¿ ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE IN VIVO EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, ASYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER THESE ADDITIONAL SURGERIES. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF DEFLATION. ADDITIONAL COMPLICATIONS Â¿ AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. CALCIUM DEPOSITS CAN FORM IN THE TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT WITH SYMPTOMS THAT MAY INCLUDE PAIN AND FIRMNESS. LYMPHADENOPATHY HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED IN SOME WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS. IN THE PASS STUDY, AT LEAST 1 REOPERATION WAS PERFORMED ON 315 PATIENTS (36.5%) THROUGH 10 YEARS. A TOTAL OF 424 REOPERATIONS WERE PERFORMED. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR REOPERATION THROUGH 10 YEARS ON AUGMENTATION PATIENTS WAS IMPLANT DEFLATION AT 21.7%. THE PERCENTAGE OF REOPERATIONS DUE TO LUMP/MASS/CYST INCREASED FROM 8.5% OF 293 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 5 YEARS TO 13.9% OF 424 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 10 YEARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF LUMPS, MASSES, AND CYSTS CAN BE EXPECTED TO NATURALLY INCREASE AS PATIENTS AGE AND COULD BE AN EXPLANATION FOR THE INCREASE. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.

DEATHS MUST BE REPORTED TO ALLERGAN AND FDA. SILICONE DEVICE LABELING: ONE OF THE KEY COMPLICATIONS REPORTED IS CALLED Â¿CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE.Â¿ CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS A TIGHTENING OF THE SCAR TISSUE (ALSO CALLED A CAPSULE) THAT NORMALLY FORMS AROUND THE BREAST IMPLANT DURING THE HEALING PROCESS AFTER SURGERY. IN SOME WOMEN, THE SCAR TISSUE (CAPSULE) SQUEEZES THE IMPLANT. THIS RESULTS IN FIRMNESS OR HARDENING OF THE BREAST, AND IT IS A RISK FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE. DEGREES OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE ARE CLASSIFIED BY THE BAKER GRADING SCALE.1 CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BAKER GRADES III AND IV ARE THE MOST SEVERE. BAKER GRADE III OFTEN RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SURGERY (REOPERATION) BECAUSE OF PAIN AND POSSIBLY ABNORMAL APPEARANCE. BAKER GRADE IV USUALLY RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR REOPERATION BECAUSE OF PAIN AND UNACCEPTABLE APPEARANCE. DO NOT TREAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BY CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY OR FORCEFUL EXTERNAL COMPRESSION, WHICH WILL LIKELY RESULT IN IMPLANT DAMAGE, RUPTURE, FOLDS, AND/OR HEMATOMA. ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. YOU SHOULD PERFORM SELF-EXAMINATION OF YOUR BREASTS EVERY MONTH FOR CANCER SCREENING. HOWEVER, THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU DISTINGUISH THE IMPLANT FROM YOUR BREAST TISSUE. THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGES IN IMPLANT SHAPE, MAY BE SIGNS OF A RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. THESE SIGNS SHOULD BE REPORTED TO YOUR SURGEON AND POSSIBLY EVALUATED WITH AN MRI. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM.

SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT.

CANCER PUBLISHED STUDIES INDICATE THAT BREAST CANCER IS NO MORE COMMON IN WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS THAN THOSE WITHOUT IMPLANTS. A LARGE, LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP FOUND NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE RISK RATES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CANCERS, INCLUDING STOMACH CANCER, LEUKEMIA, AND LYMPHOMA. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.

FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTER REGARDING THE EVENT, PRODUCT, AND/OR PATIENT DETAILS WAS REQUESTED. NO FURTHER FOLLOW UP IS POSSIBLE, AS THE CORRESPONDING AUTHOR IS DECEASED. DEVICE LABELING: THE STRESSES OF THE EXPANDING DEVICE MAY INDUCE PRESSURE ISCHEMIA AND NECROSIS, ESPECIALLY IN TIGHT OR THIN-SKINNED AREAS. FOLDS IN A PARTIALLY FILLED TISSUE EXPANDER MAY ALSO RESULT IN THINNING AND EROSION OF ADJACENT TISSUE. EXCESSIVELY RAPID TISSUE EXPANSION MAY COMPROMISE THE VASCULARITY OF THE OVERLYING TISSUE. AS EXPECTED FOLLOWING ANY INVASIVE SURGICAL PROCEDURE, PAIN OF VARYING INTENSITY AND DURATION MAY OCCUR FOLLOWING TISSUE EXPANDER PLACEMENT. IN ADDITION, THE EXPANSION PROCESS MAY CAUSE SOME DISCOMFORT, BUT SHOULD NOT CAUSE EXCESSIVE PAIN. PAIN MAY INDICATE EXPANSION BEYOND TISSUE TOLERANCE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN ISCHEMIA AND NECROSIS. PAIN MAY ALSO ACCOMPANY OTHER ADVERSE REACTIONS. UNEXPLAINED PAIN MUST BE PROMPTLY INVESTIGATED. FURTHER EXPANSION SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED UNTIL THE PAIN IS RESOLVED. ACTIVE INFECTION ANYWHERE IN THE BODY MAY INCREASE RISK OF PERIPROSTHETIC INFECTION. DO NOT EXPOSE THE TISSUE EXPANDER OR INJECTION NEEDLES TO CONTAMINANTS, WHICH INCREASE THE RISK OF INFECTION. PATIENTS WHO PRESENT WOUND DEHISCENCE, TISSUE EROSION, ISCHEMIA OR NECROSIS RUN AN INCREASED RISK OF PERIPROSTHETIC INFECTION. MEASURES TO PROTECT SUCH AREAS FROM INFECTION SHOULD BE TAKEN. THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY. THE RISKS INCLUDE: IMPLANT DEFLATION/LEAKAGE, ADDITIONAL SURGERY, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, INFECTION, TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME, NECROSIS, HEMATOMA, SEROMA, EXTRUSION, BREAST PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE SENSATION, CHANGES IN BREAST SENSATION, DISSATISFACTION WITH COSMETIC RESULTS (WRINKLING, FOLDING, DISPLACEMENT, ASYMMETRY, PALPABILITY, VISIBILITY, PTOSIS, SLOSHING), CALCIFIC DEPOSITS, IRRITATION/INFLAMMATION, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, HYPERTROPHIC SCARRING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, DIFFICULTY/INABILITY IN BREAST FEEDING, AND INABILITY TO ADEQUATELY VISUALIZE BREAST LESIONS WITH MAMMOGRAPHY.

RUPTURES CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO RUPTURE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, STRESSING THE IMPLANT DURING IMPLANTATION AND WEAKENING IT, FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL, EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED), TRAUMA, COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING, AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF RUPTURE FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT. IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF RUPTURE. LABORATORY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RUPTURE ARE ONGOING. SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SEE TABLE 3 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING MRI SCREENING. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE. IF RUPTURE OCCURS, SILICONE GEL MAY EITHER REMAIN WITHIN THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), MOVE OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE (EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), OR MOVE OUTSIDE THE BREAST (GEL MIGRATION).|STYLE 45 SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|45-550|07/25/2017||||N|R||0HP|FTR|1.0|05/01/2005|PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||552887A|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF RUPTURE. LABORATORY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RUPTURE ARE ONGOING. Â¿ SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. Â¿ SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. Â¿ WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. Â¿ THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE. IF RUPTURE OCCURS, SILICONE GEL MAY EITHER REMAIN WITHIN THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), MOVE OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE (EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), OR MOVE OUTSIDE THE BREAST (GEL MIGRATION). THERE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY THAT RUPTURE MAY PROGRESS FROM INTRACAPSULAR TO EXTRACAPSULAR AND BEYOND.|UNK GEL BREAST IMPLANT|UNK GEL BREAST IMPLANT|07/21/2017||||N|R||0HP|FTR|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||NI|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTER REGARDING EVENT, PRODUCT, OR PATIENT DETAILS HAS BEEN REQUESTED. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. DEVICE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT DEFLATION, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER THESE ADDITIONAL SURGERIES. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF DEFLATION. COSMETIC DISSATISFACTION (UNSATISFACTORY RESULTS) Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE INFORMED THAT DISSATISFACTION WITH COSMETIC RESULTS RELATED TO SUCH THINGS AS SCAR DEFORMITY, HYPERTROPHIC SCARRING, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, INCORRECT SIZE, AND IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY MAY OCCUR. CAREFUL SURGICAL PLANNING AND TECHNIQUE CAN MINIMIZE, BUT NOT PRECLUDE, THE RISK OF SUCH RESULTS. PRE-EXISTING ASYMMETRY MAY NOT BE ENTIRELY CORRECTABLE. PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL DIFFERENCES AMONG PATIENTS AND VARIATIONS IN SURGICAL TECHNIQUES AND MEDICAL TREATMENTS ACCOUNT FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF RESPONSES TO BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY. REVISION SURGERY MAY BE INDICATED TO MAINTAIN PATIENT SATISFACTION BUT CARRIES ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS AND RISKS.|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|07/20/2017||||N|R||0HP|FWM|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||NI|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF RUPTURE. LABORATORY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RUPTURE ARE ONGOING. SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE. IF RUPTURE OCCURS, SILICONE GEL MAY EITHER REMAIN WITHIN THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), MOVE OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE (EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), OR MOVE OUTSIDE THE BREAST (GEL MIGRATION).

ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.|STYLE 110 SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|27-110241|06/07/2017||||N|R||0HP|FTR|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||NI|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES WITH NO RELIEF, EYESIGHT, MY TEETH, HAVE A HARD TIME SWALLOWING, HAVE TO DO IT ABOUT 4 TIMES TO FEEL ANY RELIEF, CONSTANT COUGH. EVERYTHING IS TO THE POINT NOW THAT I FEEL AS IF MY DOCTOR THINKS I'M CRAZY. HE BLOWS ME OFF WHEN I TRY TO TELL HIM WHAT'S GOING ON. JUST PRESCRIBED MORE MEDICATION THAT I DO NOT NEED. I FEEL LIKE I AM SLOWLY DYING AND MY YOUNGER 4 KIDS HAVE MISSED OUT ON A LOT WITH ME BECAUSE OF THE TIMES I COULDN'T GO TO THEIR GAMES, CLASSES, GRADUATION BECAUSE I WAS TOO SICK TO GET UP AND GO OR TRIED AND JUST COULDN'T DO IT. IT'S HARD TO REMEMBER WHAT NORMAL USED TO BE. I AM TERRIFIED OF DYING AND LEAVING MY KIDS WITH NO MOTHER JUST BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WANTED THEM. ALSO, WHEN GOT MY IMPLANTS, THE DOCTOR NEVER TOLD ME THAT I WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE EVERY 7-10 YRS OR I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN THEM, I WANT THESE OUT IMMEDIATELY. NEED ASSISTANCE WITH INSURANCE OR SOMETHING BECAUSE I DO NOT HAVE THE CASH THAT THE PLASTIC SURGEON WANTS. MY NEXT STEP, I BELIEVE WILL BE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THE MFR, MY DOCTOR, THE PLASTIC SURGEON, ETC. I HAVE BEGGED REPEATEDLY FOR SOMEONE TO HELP ME. NO ONE WANTS TO ADMIT THAT THE IMPLANTS ARE CAUSING SICKNESS IN WOMEN. PLEASE HELP ME! I HAVE MANY MORE SYMPTOMS, I AM HAVING TROUBLE REMEMBERING AT THE MOMENT.

I EVEN DEVELOPED (B)(6) 3 WEEKS AFTER THE SURGERY UNDER MY ARMPIT, WHICH I'VE NEVER HAD. I HAVEN'T EVEN HAD A COLD FOR AT LEAST 2 YEARS OR MORE. BUT SINCE THE SURGERY I FEEL LIKE MY LYMPH NODES ARE CONSTANTLY SWOLLEN AND KEEP STRUGGLING TO FIGHT OFF INFECTIONS AND COLDS. I WANT THEM REMOVED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE I KNOW THEY ARE TOXIC AND MY BODY IS REACTING TO THEM. THERE SHOULD BE SOME KIND OF WARNING ABOUT THE DANGERS OF BREAST IMPLANTS. I'VE BEEN READING ENDLESS STORIES ONLINE. IMPLANTS SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET, THEY ARE SO HAZARDOUS TO OUR HEALTH. I EVEN CONTACTED MENTOR AND THE FDA VIA EMAIL BEFORE AND NEITHER SEEMED TO CARE. SO I AM REPORTING MY SITUATION. ALL I WANT IS FOR MY ORIGINAL BREASTS TO LOOK NORMAL AND NOT HAVE THE MUSCLE FLEX DEFORMITY. MY DOCTOR SAID THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE TO PREVENT OR FIX THE DEFORMITY ONCE THE IMPLANTS ARE REMOVED. I THOUGHT MAYBE AN EXPANDER THAT WOULD BE PLACED BETWEEN THE MUSCLE AND TISSUE TO PUSH THE MUSCLE BACK DOWN TO THE CHEST WALL OR MAYBE STITCHES TO STICK THE MUSCLE BACK DOWN SO THAT IT'S NOT PULLING THE BREAST TISSUE WHEN I FLEX. WHAT IS YOUR RECOMMENDATION? MY FIRST ONES WERE REMOVED VIA THE AREA INCISION AND NOW I HAVE AN INCISION IN THE INFRAMAMMARY LOCATION. DO YOU THINK THAT MADE A DIFFERENCE IN THE MUSCLE DEFORMITY? I'M SO FRUSTRATED AND DEPRESSED ABOUT THE LAST 12 YEARS OF FEELING HORRIBLE AND I WISH I NEVER DECIDED TO GET NEW IMPLANTS. I FEEL MY BREASTS ARE RUINED FOREVER NOW. AT THIS POINT, THOUGH, I REALLY JUST WANT TO FEEL HEALTHY AGAIN AND GET THESE TOXIC BAGS OUT!|SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLANT||03/27/2017||||Y|I||I|FTR|2.0||SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLANT|||||||MENTOR|||||||True
6748662|81227950|N|1||ALLERGAN HAS INITIATED AN INVESTIGATION INTO THIS LATE REPORT IN CAPA # (B)(4). THE MCGHAN180CC DEVICE RELATED TO THE REPORTED EVENT OF RUPTURE WAS RECEIVED ON 04/JUL/2017. VISUAL ANALYSIS OF THE RETURNED DEVICE IDENTIFIED: WEIGHT TO THE SPEC AND DEFORMATION. BUBBLES WERE OBSERVED AFTER AUTOCLAVE DISINFECTION PROCESS. THE DEVICE DID NOT HAVE AN OPENING. BASED ON THE DEVICE ANALYSIS THE FINAL ASSESSMENT WAS: NO ISSUES FOUND RELATED WITH THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTER REGARDING EVENT, PRODUCT, OR PATIENT DETAILS HAS BEEN REQUESTED. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. DEVICE LABELING: UNDERGOING ANY TYPE OF SURGERY INVOLVES RISKS. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF LOCAL COMPLICATIONS (PROBLEMS AT OR NEAR THE BREAST/SURGICAL INCISION SITE) THAT MAY OCCUR AFTER YOUR BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY. THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS PRESENT RESULTS FROM ALLERGANÂ¿S CORE CLINICAL STUDY CONDUCTED ON NATRELLE Â® SILICONE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANTS. GLOSSARY: RUPTURE - A HOLE OR TEAR IN THE SHELL OF THE IMPLANT THAT ALLOWS SILICONE GEL FILLER MATERIAL TO LEAK FROM THE SHELL. RUPTURES CAN BE INTRACAPSULAR (INSIDE THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT) OR EXTRACAPSULAR (OUTSIDE THE SCAR TISSUE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT). WARNINGS: RUPTURE OF A SILICONE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT IS MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR SURGEON WILL KNOW THAT YOUR IMPLANTS HAVE A RUPTURE. THEREFORE YOU WILL NEED REGULAR MRI SCREENINGS OVER YOUR LIFETIME IN ORDER TO DETERMINE IF RUPTURE IS PRESENT. YOU SHOULD HAVE AN MRI 3 YEARS AFTER YOUR BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY AND THEN EVERY 2 YEARS AFTER THAT FOR AS LONG AS YOU HAVE YOUR BREAST IMPLANTS. IF IMPLANT RUPTURE IS NOTED ON AN MRI, YOU SHOULD HAVE THE IMPLANT REMOVED, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT.|UNK GEL BREAST IMPLANT|UNK GEL BREAST IMPLANT|07/27/2017||07/04/2017||R|Y||0HP|FTR|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||NI|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTER REGARDING THE EVENT, PRODUCT, AND/OR PATIENT DETAILS WAS REQUESTED. DEVICE LABELING: BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.

FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTER REGARDING DEVICE DETAILS IS BEING REQUESTED. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REPORTED EVENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN DEVICE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.

THE REPORTED EVENTS ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THESE EVENTS. REPORTED EVENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN THE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|05/18/2017||||N|R||0HP|FWM|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||NI|||||UNKNOWN MANUFACTURER|||||||True

CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/ OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE.

THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE.

CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER THESE ADDITIONAL SURGERIES. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF DEFLATION. PAIN OF VARYING INTENSITY AND LENGTH OF TIME MAY OCCUR AND PERSIST FOLLOWING BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY. IN ADDITION, IMPROPER SIZE, PLACEMENT, SURGICAL TECHNIQUE, OR CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY RESULT IN PAIN. PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED TO CONTACT THEIR SURGEON IF THERE IS SIGNIFICANT PAIN OR IF PAIN PERSISTS. UNSATISFACTORY RESULTS Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE INFORMED THAT DISSATISFACTION WITH COSMETIC RESULTS RELATED TO SUCH THINGS AS SCAR DEFORMITY, HYPERTROPHIC SCARRING, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, INCORRECT SIZE, AND IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY MAY OCCUR. CAREFUL SURGICAL PLANNING AND TECHNIQUE CAN MINIMIZE, BUT NOT PRECLUDE, THE RISK OF SUCH RESULTS. PRE-EXISTING ASYMMETRY MAY NOT BE ENTIRELY CORRECTABLE.

THE REPORTED EVENTS ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THESE EVENTS. REVIEW OF DHR FOR WORK ORDER 2436682 DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY DEVIATIONS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS OR NON-CONFORMANCES THAT MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE REPORTED DEVICE EVENT. ALL GEL BREAST IMPLANTS WERE REVIEWED AS PART OF THE ASSEMBLY OPERATIONS AND THESE TASKS WERE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO APPLICABLE CURRENT PROCEDURES TO ENSURE THAT ASSEMBLY MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. THE DHR ASSEMBLY REPORT FROM SAP WAS VERIFIED AND THERE WAS NOT SCRAP RELATED WITH REPORTED EVENT, ALL DEVICES WERE CONFORMANCE DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. THE QMS LISTING REPORT INDICATES THAT THERE WERE NO NCMRS OR DEVIATIONS RELATED FOR UNITS MANUFACTURED ON WORK ORDER 2436682. ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION GATHERED DURING THE DHR REVIEW, THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT DEVICES FROM WORK ORDER 2436682 WERE ASSEMBLED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALLERGAN MEDICAL PROCEDURES AND SPECIFICATIONS. THE REPORTED DEVICE WAS INTACT AT THE TIME OF PRODUCTION AND MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. REPORTED EVENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN THE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.|STYLE 410 COHESIVE SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|N-27-MF130-375|06/14/2017|||DA|N|R||0HP|FTR|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||2436682|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

THE REPORTED EVENTS ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THESE EVENTS. REVIEW OF DHR (DEVICE HISTORY RECORD) FOR WORK ORDER (B)(4) DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY DEVIATIONS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS OR NON-CONFORMANCES DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. ALL GEL BREAST IMPLANTS WERE REVIEWED AS PART OF THE ASSEMBLY OPERATIONS AND THESE TASKS WERE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO APPLICABLE CURRENT PROCEDURES TO ENSURE THAT ASSEMBLY MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. DHR FOR WORK ORDER (B)(4) INDICATES THAT THERE WAS A REPROCESS FOR TWO UNITS ON THE PRIMARY PACKAGING OPERATION, HOWEVER THIS WAS COMPLETED ON A DIFFERENT SERIAL NUMBER UNIT AND THIS HAS NO RELATION NEITHER CAN CAUSE THE REPORTED EVENT. THE DHR ASSEMBLY REPORT FROM ORACLE WAS VERIFIED AND THERE WAS NOT ANY SCRAP RELATED WITH REPORTED EVENT, ALL DEVICES WERE CONFORMANCE DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION GATHERED DURING THE DHR REVIEW, THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT DEVICES FROM WORK ORDER (B)(4) WERE ASSEMBLED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALLERGAN MEDICAL PROCEDURES AND SPECIFICATIONS. THE REPORTED DEVICE WAS INTACT AT THE TIME OF PRODUCTION AND MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. REPORTED EVENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN THE LABELING: ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. YOU SHOULD PERFORM SELF-EXAMINATION OF YOUR BREASTS EVERY MONTH FOR CANCER SCREENING. HOWEVER, THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU DISTINGUISH THE IMPLANT FROM YOUR BREAST TISSUE. THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGES IN IMPLANT SHAPE, MAY BE SIGNS OF A RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. THESE SIGNS SHOULD BE REPORTED TO YOUR SURGEON AND POSSIBLY EVALUATED WITH AN MRI. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.|INSPIRA TEXTURED SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|TRM310|05/04/2017||||N|R||0HP|FTR|1.0|09/14/2011|PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||1327562|KILBRIDE INDUSTRIAL ESTATE||ARKLOW, COUNTY WICKLOW||ALLERGAN (ARKLOW)|||||||True

FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTER REGARDING THE EVENT, PRODUCT, AND/OR PATIENT DETAILS WAS REQUESTED. DEVICE LABELING: Â¿POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE.Â¿ Â¿CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER THESE ADDITIONAL SURGERIES. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF DEFLATION.Â¿|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|05/18/2017||||N|R||0HP|FWM|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||NI|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM.

ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|05/18/2017||||N|R||0HP|FWM|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||NI|||||UNKNOWN MANUFACTURER|||||||True

IN ADDITION, THE EXPANSION PROCESS MAY CAUSE SOME DISCOMFORT, BUT SHOULD NOT CAUSE EXCESSIVE PAIN. PAIN MAY INDICATE EXPANSION BEYOND TISSUE TOLERANCE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN ISCHEMIA AND NECROSIS. PAIN MAY ALSO ACCOMPANY OTHER ADVERSE REACTIONS. UNEXPLAINED PAIN MUST BE PROMPTLY INVESTIGATED. FURTHER EXPANSION SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED UNTIL THE PAIN IS RESOLVED. ACTIVE INFECTION ANYWHERE IN THE BODY MAY INCREASE RISK OF PERIPROSTHETIC INFECTION. DO NOT EXPOSE THE TISSUE EXPANDER OR INJECTION NEEDLES TO CONTAMINANTS, WHICH INCREASE THE RISK OF INFECTION.

YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.

BENGSTON, MD, FACS, PUBLISHED IN AESTHETIC SURGERY JOURNAL, VOL. 37, ISSUE 3, 01MAR2017 PP. 297-300.

FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTER REGARDING THE EVENT, PRODUCT, AND/OR PATIENT DETAILS WAS REQUESTED. DEVICE LABELING: Â¿POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE.Â¿ Â¿CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER THESE ADDITIONAL SURGERIES. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF DEFLATION.Â¿|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|05/17/2017||||N|R||0HP|FWM|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||NI|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM.

DO NOT EXPOSE THE TISSUE EXPANDER OR INJECTION NEEDLES TO CONTAMINANTS, WHICH INCREASE THE RISK OF INFECTION. PATIENTS WHO PRESENT WOUND DEHISCENCE, TISSUE EROSION, ISCHEMIA OR NECROSIS RUN AN INCREASED RISK OF PERIPROSTHETIC INFECTION. MEASURES TO PROTECT SUCH AREAS FROM INFECTION SHOULD BE TAKEN. SIGNS OF ACUTE INFECTION REPORTED IN ASSOCIATION WITH TISSUE EXPANDERS INCLUDE, TENDERNESS, FLUID ACCUMULATION, PAIN AND FEVER. INFECTION MAY COMPROMISE THE EXPANSION PROCESS. POSTOPERATIVE INFECTIONS SHOULD BE TREATED AGGRESSIVELY ACCORDING TO STANDARD MEDICAL PRACTICES TO AVOID MORE SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS. INFECTION THAT IS UNRESPONSIVE TO TREATMENT OR NECROTIZING INFECTION MAY REQUIRE PREMATURE TISSUE EXPANDER REMOVAL. INFECTION IS AN INHERENT RISK FOLLOWING ANY TYPE OF INVASIVE SURGERY, AND MAY OCCUR DURING THE TISSUE EXPANSION PROCESS.

SHE TOLD HER DR WHEN HER HANDS GOT COLD THEY TURNED BLUE, THEN BLACK BEFORE ALL THE BLOOD DRAINED FROM THEM AND THEY TURNED TRANSPARENT. SHE SAYS THEY CAN BE VERY PAINFUL. HANDLING ANYTHING COLD OR EVEN DRINKING SOMETHING COLD CAN BRING ON THE PROBLEM. HER FEET ARE THE SAME. HER TOES AND TOENAILS ARE SORE AROUND THE EDGES.

ANTIBIOTICS DIDN'T SEEM TO HELP HER MUCH. HER DR SENT HER FOR MAMMOGRAMS AND X-RAYS BUT DID NOT FIND ANYTHING. A RECENT MRI SHOWED AN INTRACAPSULAR LEFT BREAST IMPLANT WITH NO EVIDENCE OF EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE. SUPEROLATERAL AND MEDIAL EXTRUSION WAS PRESENT. IT SHOWED AN INTACT RIGHT IMPLANT. A BILATERAL IMPLANT ULTRASOUND DEMONSTRATED ABUNDANT HOMOGENEOUS ECHOES IN THE RIGHT BREAST IMPLANT CONSISTENT WITH INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE. THE LEFT IMPLANT, BY COMPARISON, HAD SMOOTH MARGINS AND AN ANECHOIC INTERIOR CONSISTENT WITH INTEGRITY. THE INFO SHE RECEIVED SAID ARM AND SHOULDER PAIN MIGHT BE A SYMPTOM. ON 10/17/91 SHE WAS ADMITTED TO THE HOSP FOR SHOULDER SURGERY. IN JANUARY, SHE STARTED HAVING SEVERE SCALP ITCH. BUMPS CAME UP ON HER HEAD AND WOULD OOZE AND FORM CLEAR SCABS WHEN SHE SCRATCHED THEM. SHE WENT TO TWO DERMATOLOGISTS WITH NO RELIEF. SHE ALSO DEVELOPED A SEVERE BLADDER INFECTION. SHE WENT TO ONE DR WHO GAVE HER ANTIBIOTICS, AND SAID THAT IT SHOULD ALSO HELP THE RASH THAT HAD DEVELOPED IN PATCHES OVER HER BODY. SHE RECEIVED NO RELIEF. FINALLY, SHE WENT BACK TO HER FAMILY DR WHO PUT HER ON ANTIBIOTICS AND THE RASH BEGAN TO CLEAR. AFTER ABOUT 2 WEEKS, MOST OF THE RASH HAD DISAPPEARED EXCEPT ON HER HEAD. IT IS BETTER BUT STILL POPS UP. HER BLADDER SEEMS TO BE OK NOW. SHE HAS HAD SEVERE HAIR LOSS PROBABLY DUE TO INFECTED SCALP. SHE THINKS SHE SHOULD HAVE THESE IMPLANTS REMOVED AND NOT REPLACED.

IN 1979, THE LEFT IMPLANT WAS REPLACED WITH THIS CO'S DOUBLE LUMEN GEL/SALINE IMPLANT. AFTER EXPLANTATION SURGERY 8/17/94, LAB ANALYSIS REPORT FROM DR WAS OBTAINED EXPLAINING THE PROBLEMS WITH FAILED IMPLANTS. THE DEVICE FROM THE CONTAINER IDENTIFIED AS THE LEFT SIDE WAS EVIDENTLY THE REPLACEMENT FOR A FAILIED IMPLANT FROM THE PREVIOUS SURGERY. IT WAS IDENTIFIED AS A DOUBLE LUMEN CONSISTENT WITH PRODUCTION CIRCA 1977-78. THE CRITERIA OF IDENTIFICATION INCLUDE A LEAF VALVE EXCLUSIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CO'S PRODUCTS. THIS IS NOT A SALINE IMPLANT, IT IS A COMBINATION GEL WITH ADDED SALINE IN A SEPARATE COMPARMENT. THE LEFT IMPLANT HAD PERFORATED INNER AND OUTER SHELLS AND WAS SEVERELY CONTAMINATED BY TISSUE AND POSSIBLY MICRO-ORGANISMS AND THEIR METABOLITES. THE GEL LEAKED PROFUSELY THROUGH MULTIPLE PERFORATIONS. THE GEL WAS ALSO INVASIVE AND OF AN EASILY DISPERSED NATURE. THE LOSS OF GEL PROPERTY (REVERSION FROM A COHESIVE PRODUCT TO AN OIL-LIKE ENTITY) IS A SIGN OF CHEMICAL DEGRADATION. THE CAPSULE RECEIVED IN THE CONTAINER INDICATING THE RIGHT SIDE SHOWS A DISORGANIZED MASS OF TISSUE CONSISTENT WITH SEVERE ADVERSE REACTIONS AND FAILURE OF THE CAPSULE TO CONTAIN THE DEBRIS OF A GROSSLY LEAKING PROSTHESIS. IT ALSO INDICATES MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS AT CLOSED CAPSULOTOMIES AND POSSIBLE INFECTION. NODULAR PORTIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH GRANULOMATOUS MATERIALS FROM A PT WHO RECEIVED MULTIPLE IMPLANTS AND WHERE DEBRIDEMENT OF THE TISSUE (ABLATIVE CAPSULECTOMY) WAS NOT PERFORMED AT THE TIME OF PROSTHESIS REPLACEMENT. THE CAPSULE RECEIVED IN THE CONTAINER INDICATING THE LEFT SIDE WAS EXTENSIVELY CALCIFIED WITH PLAQUE-LIKE ENTITIES. THESE SUGGEST A PROLONGED EXPOSURE TO AGGRESSIVE CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES RESULTING IN NECROSIS AND MINERALIZATION. IT APPEARS MOST PROBLEM THAT THE CAPSULES WERE TRANSPOSED SOME TIME AFTER SURGERY. IN PRINCIPLE, THE CALCIFIED CAPSULE SHOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DOUBLE LUMEN IMPLANT. (ALSO SEE 1005399.)

20210|11245|D|1||BECAUSE OF FIBROCYSTIC DISEASE, RPTR HAD RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY 12/20/76. DUE TO SCAR CONTRACTURE AND TWO UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS AT CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, BOTH IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED AND THE SAME IMPLANTS WERE REINSERTED. IN 1979, THE LEFT IMPLANT WAS REPLACED WITH A DOUBLE LUMEN GEL/SALINE IMPLANT. THE FOLLOWING IS FROM A LABORATORY ANALYSIS REPORT AFTER EXPLANTATION: THE IMPLANTS WERE PERFORATED AT MULTIPLE LOCATIONS. THE RECEIVED ORIGINAL RIGHT SIDE IMPLANT HAD A SEVERELY DEGRADED SHELL AS WELL AS PERFORATIONS BUT IT WAS NOT GROSLY RUPTURED. THE LEFT IMPLANT HAD PERFORATED INNER AND OUTER SHELLS AND WAS SEVERELY CONTAMINATED BY TISSUE AND POSSIBLY MICRO-ORGANISMS AND THEIR METABOLITES. THE GEL LEAKED PROFUSELY THROUGH MULTIPLE PERFORATIONS. THE GEL WAS ALSO INVASIVE AND OF AN EASILY DISPERSED NATURE. THE CAPSULE RECEIVED IN THE CONTAINER INDICATING THE RIGHT SIDE SHOWS A DISORGANIZED MASS OF TISSUE CONSISTENT WITH SEVERE ADVERSE REACTION AND FAILURE OF THE CAPSULE TO CONTAIN THE DEBRIS OF A GROSSLY LEAKING PROSTHESIS. IT ALSO INDICATES MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS AT CLOSED CAPSULOTOMIES AND POSSIBLE INFECTION. NODULAR PORTIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH GRANULOMATOUS MATERIAL AND A PT WHO RECEIVED MULTIPLE IMPLANTS AND WHERE DEBRIDEMENT OF THE TISSUE (ABLATIVE CAPSULECTOMY) WAS NOT PERFORMED AT THE TIME OF PROSTHESIS REPLACEMENT. THE CAPSULE RECEIVED IN THE CONTAINER INDICATING THE LEFT SIDE WAS EXTENSIVELY CALCIFIED WITH PLAQUE-LIKE ENTITIES. THESE SUGGEST A PROLONGED EXPOSURE TO AGGRESSIVE CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES RESULTING IN NECROSIS AND MINERALIZATION. OVERALL IMPRESSIONS SUGGEST, A PT WITH MULTIPLE PROSTHETIC MISADVENTURES AND EXTENSIVE TISSUE DAMAGE IN THE PROSTHETIC AREA IN ADDITION TO POSSIBLE METABOLIC DISTURBANCES AND SYSTEMIC EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH ABSORPTION OF MIXED BIOACTIVE SUBSTANCES ORIGINATING FROM FAULTY BREAST PROSTHESES.

SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDED INFECTION, RUPTURE, CHRONIC PAIN AND FATIGUE, CHRONIC INFLAMMATION, SPEECH AND VISION PROBLEMS, DISCHARGE FROM NIPPLE, HUMAN ADJUVANT DISEASE, FIBROMYALGIA. ACCORDING TO A MEDICAL AND NEUROLOGIC EVALUATION 1/30/95: PT REPORTS BEING IN HER USUAL EXCELLENT STATE OF MEDICAL, NEUROLOGIC, AND PSYCHIATRIC HEALTH WHEN SHE CONSULTED THE DR FOR COSMETIC AUGMENTATION MAMMOPLASTY WITH INSERTION OF BILATERAL SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS. SHE DEVELOPED SOME IMMEDIATE DECREASED SENSATION IN THE NIPPLES, WHICH WITH TIME CHANGED TO A MILD HYPERSENSITIVITY. OTHERWISE, THERE WERE NO IMMEDIATE COMPLICATIONS FROM THIS SURGERY. HOWEVER, ONE WEEK LATER, PT WAS INVOLVED IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT. SHE IMMEDIATELY DEVELOPED BURNING PAIN IN HER BREASTS, AND IMPLANTS WERE KNOCKED INTO NEW POSITIONS, WITH ONE OBVIOUSLY AT A DIFFERENT LEVEL THAN THE OTHER. NO IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION WAS ATTEMPTED, WITH THE HOPE THAT WITH TIME IMPLANTS WOULD RELOCATE TO A BETTER POSITION ON THEIR OWN. HOWEVER, INSTEAD, BOTH IMPLANTS HARDENED MARKEDLY, ESPECIALLY ON THE RIGHT, AND DID NOT IMPROVE IN PLACEMENT. DUE TO THE UNACCEPTABLE HARDENING AND PLACEMENT, PT WAS REOPERATED IN 1975, WITH FINDINGS OF BILATERAL IMPLANT RUPTURE. NEW IMPLANTS WERE PLACED AT THAT TIME. SHORTLY THEREAFTER, BOTH IMPLANTS HARDENED, ESPECIALLY ON THE RIGHT, AND SEVERAL CLOSED CAPSULOTOMIES WERE PERFORMED, WHICH EVENTUALLY SOFTENED THE LEFT IMPLANT, BUT COULD NOT EFFECTIVELY SOFTEN THE RIGHT ONE. IN 1978, THE RIGHT IMPLANT AND EXTENSIVE SCAR TISSUE WERE REMOVED AND A NEW IMPLANT PLACED ON THE RIGHT. THIS IMPLANT AGAIN MARKEDLY HARDENED AND WAS REPLACED AGAIN IN 1979, 1982, AND 1982, WITH SEVERE RE-HARDENING AND PAIN EACH TIME. STINGING AND BURNING PAINS IN THE CHEST AND BREAST AREAS PERSISTED. BETWEEN 1985 AND 1990, THERE WAS AGAIN SEVERE RE-HARDENING ON THE RIGHT ""LIKE A ROCK."" IN 1990, PT HAD BOTH IMPLANTS REMOVED AND NEW IMPLANTS PLACED.

178340|119725|D|1||"READS: ""ANATOMICALLY SHAPED BREAST IMPLANTS MADE BY MCGHAN MED. THESE BREAST IMPLANTS ARE SALINE FILLED-SILICONE ENVELOPES. IN 1976 MFR'S WERE PERMITTED TO MFR AND SELL BREAST IMPLANTS BY FDA. IN THE SAME YR FDA REQUIRED MFR'S TO SHOW RESEARCHED DATA TO SUPPORT THE USE OF BREAST IMPLANTS. UNTIL THIS RESEARCH COMES OUT, WOMEN PLANNING TO USE BREAST IMPLANTS NEED TO HAVE THE FOLLOWING INFO. BEFORE SURGERY IS SCHEDULED WOMEN NEED TO DISCUSS THE PROS AND CONS OF HAVING BREAST IMPLANTS. BREAST IMPLANTS CAN IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE. PLAY AN IMPORTANT PART IN THE RECOVERY OF WOMEN DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER. SOME WOMEN FIND EXTERNAL BREAST FORMS TO BE SATISFACTORY. TISSUES FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY CAN BE USED TO RECONSTRUCT BREAST. THIS REQUIRES A LONGER OPERATION, LONGER HEALING TIME. BREAST IMPLANT SURGERIES PRESENT THE SAME RISKS AS OTHER SURGERIES, EG ANESTHESIA RELATED RISKS. BREAST IMPLANTS CAN'T BE EXPECTED TO LAST FOREVER. THEY DEFLATE, RUPTURE FOR DIFFERENT REASONS. THEY CAN DEFLATE DUE TO WEAR WITH TIME, RUPTURE DUE TO INJURY. IT IS NOT KNOWN WHEN DEFLATION OCCURS. IT HAS BEEN FOUND THROUGH RESEARCH: WHEN THE SALINE LEAKS IT IS ABSORBED IN THE BODY BECAUSE NORMAL SALINE ALREADY EXISTS IN THE BODY. BREAST IMPLANTS NEED TO BE REMOVED WHEN WORN OUT, MAKE MAMMOGRAPHY DIFFICULT, WOMAN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS RECEIVE MORE RADIATION, THE FORMALIAR OF CAPSULES AROUND THE IMPLANT CAUSES CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CALCIUM DEPOSITS NEED TO BE IDENTIFIED FROM THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH CANCER, INFECTION CAN OCCUR, ESPECIALLY WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF THE OPERATION. INFECTION WITH IMPLANTS ARE HARDER TO TREAT THAN INFECTIONS WITH NORMAL TISSUE. RISK OF HAVING A HEMATOMA: CHANCES OF OCCURRING NOT KNOWN BUT USUALLY OCCURS AFTER SURGERY. SMALL HEMATOMAS CAN BE ABSORBED BY THE BODY, BUT LARGE ONES ARE SURGICALLY DRAINED WHICH CAUSES SCARRING. RESEARCH CONTINUES TO INDICATE THAT FEELING OF PAIN, BURNING SENSTAION MAY INTERFEAR WITH BREAT FEEDING AND SEXUAL RESPONSE. MANY FEEL IMPLANT SHIFTINGS AND FEEL IMPLANT THROUGH THE SKIN. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES LIKE LUPUS, SCLERODERMA, RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND NEUROLOGIC SYMPTOMS SEEN IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PT'S. IN SOME CASES THE SALINE USED HAS BEEN KNOWN TO BE CONTAMINATED WITH BACTERIA. IF SO, ORGANISMS MAY BE RELEASED IN THE BODY IF HER IMPLANTS DEFLATE. ACCORDING TO SCIENTIFIC STUDIES WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS IN GENERAL ARE NOT AT AN INCREASED RISK FOR AUTOIMMUNE OR SELECTIVE TISSUE DISEASES. HOWEVER, THESE STUDIES ARE TOO SMALL TO DETECT WETHER THERE MIGHT BE A SLIGHTLY INCREASED RISK OF ANY OF THESE RARE DISEASES. ALSO THESE CURRENT STUDIES HAVE LOOKED ONLY FOR THE SYMPTOMS OF KNOWN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES, RATHER THAN THE VARIETY OF SYMPTOMS THAT SOME WOMEN ARE EXPERIENCING. SUCH AS SWELLING, JOINT PAIN, ARTHRITIS LIKE PAIN, GENERAL ACHING, UNUSUAL HAIR LOSS, UNEXPLAINED OR UNUSUAL LOSS OF ENERGY, GREATER CHANCE OF GETTING COLDS, VIRUSES, AND FLU SWOLLEN GLANDS OR LYMPH NODES."|ANATOMICALLY SHAPED BREAST IMPLANTS||07/22/1998|A|||*||173408.0||FWM|1.0||BREAST IMPLANTS|Y||700 WARD DR.||SANTA BARBARA|US|MCGHAN MEDICAL CORP.||CA|93111||||True

POST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: BILATERAL CAPSULE FORMATION WITH CHRONIC ABSCESS AND PURULENCY, RIGHT BREAST; LEAKING IMPLANT, RIGHT BREAST. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: BILATERAL OPEN CAPSULECTOMIES; IMPLANT MATERIAL REMOVAL. PROCEDURE: THE PT WAS PREPARED AND DRAPED UNDER GENERAL ENDOTRACHEAL ANESTHESIA. ALL THE RISKS, ALTERNATIVES AND IMPONDERABLES WERE AGAIN DISCUSSED WITH THE PT PRIOR TO PROCEEDING. OUTSIDE OPERATIVE NOTES IMPLIED THIS HAD 180CC SILICONE IMPLANTS WITH A 20CC SALINE SHELL ON EACH SIDE. HER LEFT BREAST WAS LARGER THAN THE RIGHT WITH SYMPTOMATIC BILATERAL CAPSULES, RIGHT GREATER THAN LEFT. SHE ALSO HAD CHRONIC RECURRENT INFECTIONS ON THE RIGHT BREAST; MOST RECENTLY TREATED APPROX ONE MONTH AGO ON THE RIGHT SIDE. BOTH BREASTS WERE EXPLORED THROUGH BILATERAL INFRAMAMMARY INCISIONS. RIGHT SIDE WAS DONE FIRST AND ON ENTERING THE BREAST THERE WAS FRANK PURULENCY; APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF CUP FULL. THIS WAS SENT OFF FOR A STAT GRAM STAIN WHICH LATER CAME BACK SHOWING WHITE BLOOD CELLS, NO ORGANISMS, COMPATIBLE WITH A STERILE ABSCESS. IN ADDITION TO THIS, THERE WAS A VERY SIGNIFICANT CAPSULE WITH CALCIFICATION, AND THERE APPEARED TO BE A HEMATOMA FORMATION WITHIN THE CAPSULE. CAPSULE WAS VERY TEDIOUSLY REMOVED AFTER THE SILICONE IMPLANT WAS REMOVED. THE SILICONE IMPLANT WEIGHTED APPROX 188 GRAMS AND HAD A LEAK IN THE IMPLANT WITH SILICONE BLEED AROUND THE IMPLANT. BOTH OF THESE IMPLANTS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE 180CC WITH 20CC SALINE ENVELOPE. NEITHER HAD THE SALINE ENVELOPE INTACT AND WHEN THE LEFT SIDE WAS REMOVED IT TURNED OUT TO BE A 130CC IMPLANT, NO 180CC AS THE OPERATIVE DATA SHOWED THAT STAFF HAD. THE LEFT SIDE WAS DONE IN A SIMILAR FASHION, AGAIN WITH INTENSE CAPSULE FORMATION BUT THE IMPLANT WAS INTACT. BECAUSE OF THE OBVIOUS PURULENCY ENCOUNTERED AS WELL AS THE GROSS DISCREPANCY OF THE IMPLANTS, IT WAS FELT IT VERY IMPRUDENT TO REPLACE THE IMPLANTS AFTER THE BILATERAL IMPLANT REMOVAL, IMPLANT MATERIAL AND BILATERAL FORMAL OPEN CAPSULECTOMIES. STAFF WILL NEED TO DO THAT AT A SECONDARY STAGE. THE POCKETS WERE IRRIGATED WITH COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF A SOLUTION ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AND METICULOUS HEMOSTASIS WAS ACHIEVED WITH CAUTERY AND THE POCKETS WERE CLOSED OVER 19MM BLAKE DRAIN ON EACH SIDE WITH INTERRUPTED BURIED 3-0 VICRYL FOLLOWED BY INTERRUPTED BURIED 4-0 AND 5-0 VICRYL AND A LIGHT COMPRESSIVE WRAP. BLOOD LOSS WAS NEGLIGIBLE. NO BLOOD PRODUCTS WERE GIVEN. THE PT WAS AWAKE AND LEFT THE OPERATING ROOM PER ANESTHESIA. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT RIGHT BREAST IMPLANT WEIGHT WAS 188 GRAMS, LEFT BREAST 136 GRAMS. TOTAL WEIGHT OF RIGHT BREAST IMPLANT WITH CAPSULE 246 GRAMS AND LEFT BREAST IMPLANT WITH CAPSULE 155 GRAMS.

226781|18473741|D|1||"RPTR WRITES, ""AFTER HAVING MY DAUGHTER IN 6/70 I HAD PROBLEMS WITH BOTH MY BREASTS. AFTER HAVING MY SECOND DAUGHTER IN 7/71, PROBLEMS I HAD WITH BOTH MY BREASTS WERE GETTING WORSE. HAVING BEEN SEEN BY MY GENERAL PRACTITIONER, I WAS SENT FOR SCAN ON BOTH BREASTS. FIBROCYSTIC MASTITIS WAS DIAGNOSED, AND I ALSO HAD GREEN FLUID OOZING FROM BOTH NIPPLES ACCOMPANIED WITH SEVERE PAIN. THE TREATMENT I WAS ON WAS DANAZOL, BUT TO NO AVAIL. I SAW MY GENERAL PRACTITIONER AGAIN WHO THEN MADE ME AN APPOINTMENT TO SEE BREAST SURGEON. I HAD NO FURTHER SCANS THAT REVEALED I HAD FIBROCYSTIC MASTITIS; BY THAT TIME FLUID FROM BOTH MY NIPPLES HAD BECOME EMERALD GREEN COLOR, REALLY DARK GREEN, ALSO WITH PAIN BECOMING WORSE. I WAS TOLD TO WRAP HOT WATER BOTTLE IN TOWEL AND PLACE TO MY BREAST; AND I WAS GIVEN PAIN CONTROL DRUGS. I STOOD PAIN UNTIL I COULD NO MORE. IN 6/90, I SAW BREAST SURGEON AGAIN, ASKING HIM IF THERE WAS WAY HE COULD RELIEVE ME FROM TERRIBLE PAIN I WAS IN. I WAS TOLD THAT THERE COULD ONLY BE ONE SOLUTION, AND THAT WAS TO HAVE DOUBLE MASTECTOMY. HE WOULD ONLY DO IT IF I WAS TO HAVE SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. I AGREED. I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE. IN 8/89 I HAD BILATERAL ""MAMMADOCHECTOMY."" THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT EITHER, SO THAT'S WHY I ASKED FOR MASTECTOMY. I SAW BREAST SURGEON WHO REFERRED ME TO PLASTIC SURGEON, AND OPERATION WAS A JOINT ONE. THE BREAST WAS REMOVED, AND BREAST TISSUE DOWN TO MUSCLE (SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY); AND IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION WITH SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. THIS WAS CARRIED OUT IN 1990. I HAD BILATERAL SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY DEEP DOWN TO PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE, IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS IN 1990. THE IMPLANTS BECAME EXPOSED DUE TO SCARS GAPING OPEN, FLUID WAS OOZING OUT. SWABS TAKEN OF FLUID REVEALED AFTER CULTURED PLASMA (KLEBSIELLA AEROGENES). I WAS GIVEN IV 500 MG METRONIDAZOLE, TETRACYCLINE/FLUCLOXACILLIN/PAIN KILLERS TYLOX. I HAD BLOOD TRANSFUSION AND IMPLANTS REMOVED FOLLOWING DAY. I WAS TOLD WHAT HAPPENED WAS JUST A ONE IN A MILLION CHANCE OF EVER HAPPENING, AND THAT I COULD HAVE SECOND ATTEMPT OF BEING REINSERTED WITH THE BREAST IMPLANTS AFTER 8 MOS. I TOOK SURGEON'S OFFER, AND HAD SECOND ATTEMPT OF HAVING SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLANTS. AGAIN IN 1991 I HAD INSERTION OF BREAST IMPLANTS YET AGAIN. IN 1992 I ALSO HAD TO HAVE THEM REMOVED DUE TO SYSTEMIC INFECTION. IN 1997, I CAME ACROSS THE PACKAGE INSERT AND PRODUCT DATA SHEET, CLEARLY STATING THAT MASTITIS OR ANY ACTIVE INFECTION IS CONTRAINDICATED TO USE OF BREAST IMPLANTS MADE FROM SILICONE GEL. I AM SO ILL WITH FIBRO-FATTY CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDER, ACCOMPANIED WITH SEVERE PAIN, PROMINENTLY MARKED VASCULARITY, FIBROMYALGIA, CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME, HYPOTHYROIDISM, PLANTAR FASCIITIS, ARTHRITIS IN KNEES, HANDS AND BACK. I EXPERIENCE NOW SEVERE PAIN IN HANDS, FINGERS, ARMS, THIGHS, BUTTOCKS CHEEKS, HIPS, AND CALVES OF BOTH LEGS. I HAVE LOSS OF BALANCE, LOSS OF WORDS, CONCENTRATION PROBLEMS, DRY EYES, MOUTH, NOSE AND VAGINA. I ALSO HAVE A LOT OF INFECTIONS, BREATHING DIFFICULTY, BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS, THRUSH IN MOUTH/VAGINA, CHEST INFECTIONS, THROAT INFECTIONS, EAR INFECTIONS, BOWEL DISORDER, AND BLADDER PROBLEMS. I HAVE WIDESPREAD PAPILLOMAS, CHEST THROUGH ARMS AND NECK. I HAVE FIBROS TISSUE IN MY JOINTS. I ALSO HAVE PAIN IN MY HEAD; IT IS NOT A HEADACHE, IT IS LIKE WHEN INFECTION AND PUSS THROB LIKE PAIN. LOSS OF SLEEP, DROPPING THINGS, BUMPING INTO THINGS, ELECTRIC SHOCK - LIKE WHEN YOU TOUCH BARE WIRES ON ELECTRICAL GOODS, IF I TOUCH ANYTHING METAL. CRAWLING SENSATION IF I TOUCH NYLON, DRYLON, LEATHER OR POLYESTER; IF I USE TALC PERFUMED AND COLORED SOAP. I ALSO HAVE FOOD ALLERGIES. DUE TO HAVING BACTERIAL INFECTIONS I STILL EVEN TODAY TAKE METRONIDAZOLE, ANTIBIOTICS, AND ANTIFUNGAL MEDICATION TOO. I FEEL VERY WEAK, I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING CHRONIC FLU-LIKE SYMPTOMS, BUT I DON'T HAVE THE FLU. I CAN ONLY STAND, EVEN WALK SHORT PACES BEFORE BECOMING EXHAUSTED, AND MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE SEVERE PAIN I SUFFER FROM. I'M IN MY EARLY 40'S, BUT AT THIS MOMENT I FEEL LIKE 90, AND IT ISN'T RIGHT. DOCTORS I'M UNDER DON'T KNOW HOW TO BEGIN TO TREAT ME. HOWEVER, THEY KNOW WHAT CAUSE IS BUT AT THIS MOMENT CANNOT OFFER ANY KIND OF TREATMENT. I AM A TEST CASE OVER HERE OF THE DOCTORS WHO ARE DEALING WITH ME. LET'S HOPE SOMETHING CAN BE DONE PRETTY SOON. I DO BLAME SURGEONS FOR THEIR IGNORANCE AND STUPIDITY OF WAY THEY HAVE TREATED ME IN THE FIRST PLACE. TO BEGIN WITH, FOR IGNORING THE PRODUCT DATA SHEETS OF ALL BREAST IMPLANTS, ALONG WITH IGNORING THE PACKAGE INSERTS TOO. I HAVE LOST ALL TRUST AND FAITH IN MEDICAL PROFESSION. THE GOVERNMENT: FOR REFUSING TO CARRY OUT ANY KIND OF RESEARCH OR TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE LIKE ME WITH SAME ILLNESS; TREATMENT WE NEED SO DESPERATELY TO GET WELL. I KNOW I'M AS TOUGH AS NAILS. I DON'T INTEND TO SIT BACK AND DO NOTHING. I'M DETERMINED TO GET SOMEWHERE AND GET TREATMENT I SO DESPERATELY NEED. UP UNTIL 1989 I USED TO WORK FULL TIME, 16 HRS A DAY IN A CUTLERY FACTORY. I ALSO TOOK CARE OF MY MOM WHO DIED FROM TERMINAL CANCER BACK IN 1985. I ALSO TOOK CARE OF MY FATHER WHO ALSO DIED FROM A TERMINAL DISEASE. BOTH OF MY PARENTS DIED FROM CHEST ILLNESSES, MOST OF MY FATHER'S FAMILY DIED FROM TUBERCULOSIS, LUNG CANCER, HEART ATTACKS, AND STROKES. IN MY MOM'S FAMILY THEY DIED OF LUNG/BREAST CANCER ETHACENIA. THEY ALL WENT TO OPEN AIR SCHOOL. I WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS BORN IN PERFECT HEALTH, THAT IS UNTIL I MARRIED AND HAD CHILDREN AT THE AGE OF 16."" HISTORY: PT SUFFERED FROM CHRONIC BREAST PAIN FOR A PERIOD OF APPROX 20 YRS AND WHICH WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CYSTIC MASTITIS. VARIOUS CONSERVATIVE, DRUG TREATMENT REGIMES WERE TRIED TO HELP HER WITH THIS PROBLEM BUT TO NO AVAIL. SHE DESCRIBES HAVING A COLORED DISCHARGE COMING FROM HER NIPPLES IN ADDITION TO THE PAIN. SHE CAME UNDER THE CARE OF A CONSULTANT GENERAL SURGEON WHO PERFORMED AN OPERATION ON HER BREAST DUCTS IN 1989.

OPERATION PERFORMED: EXPLANTATION AND ANTERIOR CAPSULECTOMY BILATERAL BREASTS. DATE OF OPERATION: 1996. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: INDICATIONS: THIS PT IS A 45-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH A HISTORY OF BILATERAL IMPLANTS AFTER SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMIES IN 1984. SHE HAS HAD INCREASE IN DISTORTION AND PAIN OVER ONE YEAR AND WISHES TO HAVE THE IMPLANTS REMOVED. I HAVE DISCUSSED MULTIPLE RECONSTRUCTIVE OPTIONS WITH THIS PT IN DETAIL AND AT THIS TIME SHE CURRENTLY WISHES TO HAVE EXPLANT ONLY. PROCEDURE: THE PT WAS BROUGHT IN THE OR AND PLACED IN A SUPINE POSITION WHERE SATISFACTORY GENERAL ENDOTRACHEAL ANESTHESIA WAS PERFORMED. SHE WAS THEN PREPPED AND DRAPED IN THE NORMAL STERILE MANNER. AFTER STERILE PREPPING AND DRAPING, AN INCISION WAS PERFORMED ON THE RIGHT BREAST LATERALLY THROUGH THE OLD MASTECTOMY INCISION. DISSECTION WAS CARRIED DOWN THROUGH SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE TO THE IMPLANT. THE IMPLANT AND IMPLANT GAPS WERE DISSECTED FREE SUPERIORLY, MEDIALLY AND LATERALLY AND WHEN THE LIMITS OF DISSECTION WERE REACHED THE CAPSULE WAS OPENED AND THE IMPLANT WAS REMOVED. THE IMPLANT WAS NOTED TO BE INTACT BUT WAS NOTED TO BE A MCGHAN 320 CC IMPLANT. THE ANTERIOR CAPSULE WAS THEN REMOVED AND THE POSTERIOR CAPSULE AND THE CHEST WALL WERE LEFT INTACT, AS THERE WAS NO RUPTURE AND ATTEMPTING TO GET THIS CAPSULE OFF RESULTED IN SOME BLEEDING. THEREFORE, THIS WAS ABANDONED. ATTENTION WAS DIRECTED TO THE CONTRALATERAL SIDE, WHERE A SIMILAR INCISION WAS MADE AND DISSECTION ONCE AGAIN CARRIED DOWN THROUGH SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE TO THE IMPLANT CAPSULE. DISSECTION AGAIN PROCEEDED SUPERIORLY, MEDIALLY AND LATERALLY AND THE IMPLANT CAPSULE WAS OPENED AND INTACT IMPLANT WAS REMOVED. THIS WAS ALSO A MCGHAN 320 CC IMPLANT. THE ANTERIOR CAPSULE WAS THEN REMOVED. THE WOUNDS WERE THOROUGHLY AND COPIOUSLY IRRIGATED AND A JACKSON-PRATT DRAIN WAS PLACED THROUGH A SEPARATE STAB INCISION; AND THE WOUND WAS CLOSED IN LAYERS. THE DEEP TISSUE WAS CLOSED USING INTERRUPTED 4-0 VICRYL. DEEP DERMIS WAS CLOSED USING 4-0 VICRYL AND THE SKIN WAS CLOSED USING A RUNNING 6-0 NYLON. THE PT TOLERATED THE PROCEDURE WELL AND WAS EXTUBATED IN THE OR AND WAS TAKEN TO THE RECOVERY ROOM IN STABLE CONDITION. DOCTOR'S PROGRESS NOTE STATES ""PT S/P REMOVAL OF RT BREAST IMPLANT IN 1996.

211895|130455|D|1||"RPTR HAD IMPLANTS PLACED FOR COSMETIC PURPOSES. THE IMPLANTS WERE REPLACED ONCE BILATERALLY, AND RPTR CLAIMS SHE HAS HAD ONE BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY, BEGINNING WITH THE FIRST IMPLANT SURGERY. SHE CURRENTLY DOES NOT HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. RPTR CLAIMS THAT BILATERALLY THE IMPLANTS: RUPTURED, HAD BLEEDING THROUGH THE ENVELOPE, AND WERE ASSOCIATED WITH A SURGICAL AREA INFECTION. RPTR HAD ONE CLOSE CAPSULOTOMY AS TREATMENT FOR ONE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. RPTR CLAIMS TO HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH THE FOLLOWING AFTER IMPLANTATION: BRAIN LESIONS, ANXIETY &/OR DEPRESSION, ORGANIZATIONAL DIFFICULTY, LACK OF CONCENTRATION, SHORT-TERM MEMORY LOSS, MOOD SWINGS, PROCRASTINATION, GETTING LOST OR CONFUSED, ATYPICAL MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS LIKE SYMPTOMS, REDUCED BLOOD FLOW TO BRAIN, INFLAMMATION, ELEVATED CHOLESTEROL OR TRIGLICERIDES, HEAT OR COLD SENSITIVITIES, RAYNAUD'S DISEASE, CHRONIC DIARRHEA &/OR CONSTIPATION, IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME, SUBSTANTIAL HAIR LOSS NOT CONNECTED WITH MEDICATIONS, FREQUENT MIGRAINES/SEVERE HEADACHES, CHEMICALS, CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE, ATYPICAL LUPUS, SJOGREN'S SYNDROME, INFLAMMATION, SWELLING, PAIN/ARTHRALGIA, PERSISTENT JOINT STIFFNESS, CHRONIC UNEXPLAINED MUSCLE SPASMS, FROZEN SHOULDER, MUSCLE PAIN & BURNING, MUSCLE ATROPHY, FIBROMYALGIA, UNEXPLAINED RASHES, SUN SENSITIVITY, UNEXPLAINED SEVERE ITCHING, CHRONIC INSOMNIA, NON-RESTORATIVE SLEEP, CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME, LONG-TERM EXTREME FATIGUE, CLUMSINESS/DROP THINGS, MISJUDGES DISTANCE/RUN INTO OBJECTS. MD REPORT STATES: THE RIGHT SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT APPEARS TO HAVE MAINTAINED ITS STRUCTURAL SHAPE AND ELASTOMER INTEGRITY. UPON CLOSE EXAMINATION THE ELASTOMER SURFACE APPEARS DRY AND DEVOID OF ANY LUSTROUS APPEARANCE. THE SILICONE GEL WAS TRANSPARENT AND COLORLESS, BUT CONTAINED SOME PRECIPITATED PARTICLES. THE NATURE OF THE PRECIPITATED PARTICLES NOTED ABOVE WAS NOT POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED BECAUSE TO DO SO WOULD HAVE REQUIRED DAMAGING THE ELASTOMER MEMBRANE AND RUINING THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE PROSTHETIC DEVICE. NEVERTHELESS, THE PRECIPITATED PARTICLES APPEAR SIMILAR TO AGGREGATES STUDIES IN OTHER RUPTURED DEVICES. MICROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF THESE PARTICLES REVEALS THAT THEY ARE COTTON-LIKE PARACRYSTALLINE FORMATIONS. THESE FORMATIONS WERE FOUND TO BE CHEMICAL RATHER THAN BIOLOGICAL IN ORIGIN. THE LEFT SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT, UNLIKE ITS COUNTERPART, WAS RUPTURED AND SILICONE GEL WAS EXTERNALIZED. THE SILICONE GEL WAS TRANSPARENT, COLORLESS, AND DID NOT CONTAIN ANY AGGREGATED PARTICLES. THE PATHOLOGY SECTION OF THIS REPORT REVEALS THAT CELLULAR REACTIVE CHANGES OCCURRED RESULTING IN THE FORMATION OF A FIBROCONNECTIVE TISSUE CAPSULE. THIS CAPSULE DISPLAYS SIGNS OF CHRONIC INFLAMMATION. IT CONTAINS FOREIGN BODIES IN TISSUE CELLS AND FIBERS. THE SEARCH REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF SILICONE PARTICLES INFILTRATING THE BREAST CAPSULE TISSUE. THE PARTICLES WERE OBSERVED COATING THE WALLS OF THE EXTRACELLULAR SPACES BETWEEN THE TISSUE FIBERS AND CELL PARENCHYMA. THE ENLARGED PRINTS ILLUSTRATE THE SILICONE PARTICLES IN A BRIGHT OFF-WHITE COLOR THAT STANDS OUT AGAINST THE TISSUE AND BACKGROUND WHICH ARE PURPLE AND BLUE, RESPECTIVELY. THE PRESENCE AND LOCATION OF THE SILICONE GEL PARTICLES IN THESE TISSUES INDICATE THAT THEY HAD MIGRATED FROM A RUPTURED AND/OR BLEEDING IMPLANT. THE BREAST TISSUE REACTED TO THEIR PRESENCE BY FRAGMENTING THE EXTRUDED SILICONE GEL INTO MICROSCOPIC PARTICLES AND ENCAPSULATING THEM WITHIN FIBROUS TISSUE. THESE PROCESSES OCCURRED OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME AND DID NOT RESULT FROM ANY SILICONE LEAKAGE/RUPTURE THAT MAY HAVE OCCURRED DURING SURGERY FOR THEIR REMOVAL. GROSS DESCRIPTION: LABELED AS ""RIGHT BREAST IMPLANT"", THIS SPECIMEN CAME IN A PLASTIC CONTAINER INTACT. THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF BLEEDING OR RUPTURE. THE SILICONE GEL IS COLORLESS BUT SOME PRECIPITATE IS NOTICED INSIDE THE GEL. THE IMPLANT CONTAINS 225CC OF FLUID. THE IMPLANT WEIGHS 228.7 GRAMS AND MEASURES 12CM IN DIAMETER. LABELED AS ""LEFT BREAST IMPLANT"", THIS SPECIMEN CAME IN A PLASTIC CONTAINER RUPTURED. THE RUPTURE POINT IS 2CM IN LENGTH AND SILICONE GEL CAN BE SEEN PROTRUDING THROUGH THE ORIFICE. THE GEL IS CLEAR AND NO PRECIPITATE IS NOTICED. THE IMPLANT MEASURES 12.5CM IN DIAMETER AND WEIGHS 226.2 GRAMS. OPERATIVE REPORT: THIS IS A 52 YEAR OLD WHITE FEMALE WHO REQUESTED REMOVAL OF HER BILATERAL BREAST PROSTHESES. THIS PT UNDERWENT SILICONE BREAST AUGMENTATION IN 6/86 AND NOW RELATES A HISTORY OF JOINT PAINS AND RINGING IN HER EARS SINCE 3/92. AT THE TIME OF INITIAL CONSULTATION THE POSSIBILITY OF REPLACING THE IMPLANTS WITH SALINE FILLED PROSTHESES WAS DISCUSSED AND HER HUSBAND APPEARED TO FAVOR THIS. HOWEVER, THE PT WAS ADAMANT THAT SHE WANTED NO IMPLANTS AT ALL AND THEREFORE IT WAS MENTIONED THAT HER BREASTS WOULD BE SOMEWHAT PTOTIC AFTER THE SURGERY. SURGICAL PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION REPORT: THE SPECIMEN IS RECEIVED IN THE FRESH STATE, LABELLED WITH THE PT'S NAME AND ACCESSION NUMBER AS ""SALIVARY GLAND BIOPSY"", AND CONSISTS OF ONE IRREGULAR PIECE OF PINK, TAN, AND RED SOFT TISSUE MEASURING 0.8X 0.7X 0.4CM. ENTIRELY SUBMITTED. ONE CASSETTE. THE SPECIMEN IS RECEIVED IN THE FRESH STATE, LABELLED WITH THE PT'S NAME AND ACCESSION NUMBER AS ""RIGHT OLD BREAST PROSTHESIS"", CONSISTS OF ONE SEMI-TRANSPARENT SYNTHETIC BREAST IMPLANT CONTAINING THE FOLLOWING NUMBERS 225. THE BREAST IMPLANT IS INTACT AND WEIGHS 229 GRAMS. NO SECTIONS SUBMITTED. GROSS ONLY. THE SPECIMEN IS RECEIVED IN THE FRESH STATE, LABELLED WITH THE PT'S NAME AND ACCESSION NUMBER AS ""RIGHT BREAST TISSUE CAPSULE"", CONSISTS OF TWO IRREGULAR PIECES OF GREY TAN SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS MEMBRANOUS FATTY TISSUE MEASURING 11.8 X 2.0 X 0.6CM. AND 3.2 X 1.6 X 0.4CM. REPRESENTATIVE SECTIONS SUBMITTED. ONE CASSETTE. THE SPECIMEN IS RECEIVED IN THE FRESH STATE, LABELLED WITH THE PT'S NAME AND ACCESSION NUMBER AS ""LEFT BREAST CAPSULE"", AND CONSISTS OF ONE IRREGULAR FRAGMENT OF PINK, GREY AND RED FIBROMEMBRANOUS TISSUE MEASURING 3.7 X 2.2 X 0.6CM.

234767|21606396|D|1||"RPTR WRITES: ""I WRITE TO SUBMIT FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION SOME MATERIAL WHICH IS PERTINENT TO PROBLEMS OF SILICONE GEL CASUALTIES AND WHICH WE ASK YOU WILL USE AS A SMALL PART OF REPRESENTATION ON BEHALF OF THE ARGUMENT FOR SUSTAINING THE MORATORIUM ON THESE DEVICES. THESE COMPRISE: 1. SOME CORRESPONDENCE WHICH DEMONSTRATES OUR DIFFICULTIES WITH THE MEDICAL DEVICES AGENCY (MDA). THIS GIVES A) AN EXAMPLE OF THE EVASIVE RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE NATIONAL BREAST IMPLANT REGISTRY AND B) THE LACK OF ANY REVIEW OF ORAL AND WRITTEN ACCOUNTS SENT IN TO IRG BY SILICONE CASUALTIES. THIS, WE INSIST, IS A MOST SERIOUS OMISSION SINCE THE IRG WAS, PURPORTEDLY, SET UP IN RESPONSE TO NUMBERS OF COMPLAINTS ON PROBLEMS WITH SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS. 2. QUESTIONS CONCERNING PROBLEMS WITH THE STRUCTURE AND PROCESS OF THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW GROUP (IRG). THESE QUESTIONS TO THE THEN MINISTER OF HEALTH, WHO CALLED FOR THE IRG, AND LATER MINISTER FOR WOMEN) GIVE A SUMMARY OF OUR CAUSES FOR CONCERN IN TERMS OF THE DESCRIPTION ""INDEPENDENT"" OF THE IRG. WE HAVE MATERIAL TO SUBSTANTIATE OUR COMPLAINT. WE ARE AT PRESENT OFFERING OUR EVIDENCE TO THE CHAIR FOR THE SELECT COMMITTEE FOR HEALTH IN PRESSING THE NEED FOR AN INQUIRY INTO THE REVIEWING AND MONITORING (MDA) SYSTEMS EMPLOYED TO INVESTIGATE THE 'SILICONE GEL' PROBLEM HERE. 3. EXAMPLES OF EVALUATIONS SUBMITTED BY DOCTORS TO THE IRG, BUT NOT GIVEN REFERENCE IN THE TABLE OF IRG REFERENCES. 4. MY OWN COMMENTS ON THE MDA BOOK, 'SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS AND CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE' PUBLISHED IN 1994 FROM RESEARCH UNDERTAKEN BY THE MDA. THE MDA CONDUCTED THIS RESEARCH BEFORE ITS OFFICIAL INSTALLATION AS AN AGENCY OF THE DEPT OF HEALTH. THEREFORE, WHEN ACTUAL FLESH AND BLOOD CASUALTIES TRIED TO REPORT PROBLEMS, THE MDA HAD ALREADY MADE UP ITS MIND THAT THERE WERE NO SUCH THINGS AS SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH REGARD TO SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS. A NUMBER OF US HAVE NOW SUCCEEDED IN HAVING OUR COMPLAINT AGAINST THE MDA INVESTIGATED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY OMBUDSMAN. THIS IS ON THE GROUNDS OF A) EVASIVE INFO AND B) FAILURE TO TAKE UP REPORTS OF IMPLANT RUPTURE AS ADVERSE INCIDENTS AS WRITTEN DOWN IN THE MDA FRAMEWORK DOCUMENT. FOLLOWING OUR CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT IN 1997 AND AFTER CONTINUAL LOBBYING ON BEHALF OF SILICONE IMPLANT SUFFERERS, THE IRG WAS INSTALLED TO CONDUCT ITS REVIEW. THE IRG REPORT WAS PUBLISHED IN 7/98. YOU WILL NOTE OUR MISGIVINGS ABOUT THE IRG FROM THE ENCLOSED ATTACHMENT NUMBERS 1,2,3 AND 5. PERHAPS THE MOST PROBLEMATICAL AREA FOR US HAS BEEN THE MDA INFLUENCE UPON THE IRG. THE MDA WAS EMPLOYED AS SECRETARIAT TO THE IRG, BUT IT BY FAR EXCEEDED THIS ROLE. THE MDA CAME WITH A PREDETERMINED STANCE CONTAINED IN ITS STRONGLY HELD SILICONE-GEL-SAFE VIEW. IN OTHER WORDS, THE WHOLE PROCESS WAS SET ON A BIAS. THIS WAS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW THE CONVENIENT, SHORT TERM VIEW CAN BE PASSED FROM ONE REVIEW BODY TO ANOTHER, WHILE THE TERM 'INDEPENDENT' IS REPETITIVELY USED TO DESCRIBE THESE BODIES. 5. DOSSIER OF STATISTICS DRAWN FROM MODEST DISPERSAL OF QUESTIONNAIRES. THESE WERE MODELLED ON THE MEDWATCH FORMAT. BOTH THE QUESTIONNAIRES AND THE STATISTICS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED BY OUR CAMPAIGN TO THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION (WHO). 6. DOSSIER OF RESPONSES TO THE IRG REPORT FROM DOCTORS WHO DISAGREE WITH THE RESULT. THIS SHOULD BE SELF EXPLANATORY. WE ASK THAT YOU MIGHT INCLUDE OUR SUBMISSION IN YOUR DELIBERATIONS ON THIS SERIOUS PROBLEM. STATISTICS: SURVEY CARRIED OUT ON 286 WOMEN WHO DEVELOPED ILLNESSES AFTER BEING IMPLANTED WITH SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLANTS. THIS WAS CARRIED OUT AS PART OF THE EVIDENCE TO BE PRESENTED TO THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION ON 1ST APRIL 1999, WHEN A UNITED APPEAL BY THE GLOBAL NETWORK OF SILICONE VICTIMS, IN THE HOPE THAT CONSIDERATION WILL BE GIVEN INTO THE SETTING UP OF A RESEARCH PROGRAM INTO THE NEW MAN-MADE DISEASE SILICONOSIS.

ON 6/6/94, PT DIAGNOSED AS HAVING ATYPICAL CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE); 359. DISABILITY IN 1988 AT AGE 60 FOR GLOBAL SETTLEMENT. PHYSICIAN WRITES, ""I AM A PHYSICIAN, BOARD CERTIFIED IN RHEUMATOLOGY AND INTERNAL MEDICINE. I HAVE SEEN THE PT FOR EVAL OF HER GENERAL MEDICAL STATUS AS RELATED TO HER SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. BASED ON THIS ASSESSMENT, THIS WOMAN HAS HAD THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS WHICH HAVE ARISEN SINCE THE TIME HER IMPLANTS WERE PLACED: ATYPICAL CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA. GROUP I (A.): 3. KERATOCONJUNCTIVITIS SICCA WITH DRY EYES, DRY MOUTH, DOCUMENTED BY ANOTHER DR. GROUP II (B.): - IMMUNE MEDIATED SKIN CHANGES MANIFESTING AS MACULAR RASH WITH SOME ULCERATION. - SEROLOGIC ABNORMALITIES INCLUDING POSITIVE ANA (HEP II) AT 1:320 TITER, SPECKLED PATTERN. GROUP III (C.): 1. DOCUMENTED ARTHRALGIA. 2. DOCUMENTED MYALGIAS. 3. CHRONIC FATIGUE (GREATER THAN 6 MONTHS). 5. DOCUMENTED NEUROLOGICAL SYMPTOMS INCLUDING COGNITIVE, DYSFUNCTION AND PARESTHESIA. 8. DOCUMENTED DYSPHAGIA. 9. DOCUMENTED ALOPECIA. 11. DOCUMENTED SLEEP DISTURBANCES. 13. DOCUMENTED CHRONIC CYSTITIS OR BLADDER IRRITABILITY. 17. BURNING PAIN IN THE CHEST, BREAST AND ARMS. BASED ON THIS ASSESSMENT, THIS WOMAN HAS AT LEAST 1 FROM GROUP I (A), 1 FROM GROUP II (B), AND 9 FROM GROUP III (C), AND THEREFORE MEETS THE SCHEDULE CRITERIA FOR ATYPICAL CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE. THE DATE OF ONSET OF THE QUALIFYING SYMPTOMS AND CURRENT LEVEL OF DISABILITY WAS IN 1988 AT AGE 60. 1. HER IMPLANTS WERE PLACED IN 1978. 2. THEY WERE REMOVED 1991. I HAVE THE INFO NECESSARY TO FORM A PROFESSIONAL OPINION ABOUT THE PT'S DISABILITY, WHICH IS BASED ON MY EXAMINATION OF THE PT, INCLUDING A MEDICAL HISTORY AND ASSESSMENT OF HER FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY, AND ON THE PT'S MEDICAL RECORDS. THIS PT IS IN SEVERITY/DISABILITY COMPENSATION CATEGORY B, 35% DISABLED, DUE TO THE COMPENSABLE CONDITION, BECAUSE SHE DEMONSTRATES A LOSS OF FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY WHICH RENDERS HER UNABLE TO PERFORM SOME OF HER USUAL ACTIVITIES OF VOCATION, AVOCATION AND SELF-CARE. OTHER MEDICAL PROBLEMS WHICH ARE UNRELATED OR ONLY INDIRECTLY RELATED TO HER IMPLANTS CONTRIBUTE TO DISABILITY EXTENDING BEYOND THE 35% LEVEL."" PHYSICIAN WRITES, ""I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST POINT OUT THAT I INITIALLY SAW AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONSULTANT DURING HER HOSPITALIZATION IN JUNE OF 1978. AT THAT TIME, SHE HAD UNDERGONE BILATERAL BREAST REMOVAL WITH THE SUBSEQUENT REPLACEMENT OF SILASTIC IMPLANTS. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING SURGERY, SHE DEVELOPED A FEVER THAT PERSISTED. NO OBVIOUS SIGN OF INFECTION WAS DETECTED. AT THE TIME I SAW HER, HER FEVER WAS IN THE RANGE OF 101-102 AND HAD REMAINED IN THAT RANGE FOR THE PREVIOUS 7-10 DAYS, DESPITE PERIODS OF ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY, INCLUDING BOTH KEFLEX AND KEFLIN. THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT ABNORMALITY FOUND AT THAT TIME WAS A SLIGHT ELEVATION OF HER ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE, LDH, AND SGOT. ON THAT BASIS, SEROLOGIC STUDIES FOR POSSIBLE CAUSES OF HEPATITIS WERE UNDERTAKEN AND WERE ALL WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS. HOWEVER, SUBSEQUENT CONVALESCENT TITERS WERE OBTAINED, AND A RISE IN TITER OF CYTOMEGALY VIRUS SEROLOGY BETWEEN JULY 3 AND JULY 12, 1978, SHOWED A RISE FROM LESS THAN 1:8 TO A TITER OF 1:256. THIS SEROLOGIC CHANGE IS DIAGNOSTIC FOR CYTOMEGALOVIRUS, AND THEREFORE, I FEEL THE DIAGNOSIS OF CYTOMEGALOVIRUS HEPATITIS WAS ESTABLISHED. I HAVE SEEN HER IN FOLLOWUP, AT WHICH TIME HER LIVER FUNCTION TESTS HAVE RESOLVED COMPLETELY. SHE HAS SUBSEQUENTLY UNDERGONE A REVISION OF HER MAMMOPLASTY. PARENTHETICALLY, I WOULD POINT OUT THAT AS PART OF HER INITIAL WORK-UP, THERE WAS SOME CONCERN AS TO WHETHER SHE WAS HAVING A REACTION TO THE MATERIAL OF THE ORIGINAL IMPLANTS, AND THEREFORE, THESE WERE REMOVED, TO BE REPLACED APPROX ONE MONTH AGO. SHE HANDLED THE SECOND SURGERY VERY WELL, INDEED, AND AT THIS STAGE, TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE, IS TOTALLY ASYMPTOMATIC."""|MCGHAN|25-20-240|03/20/1999|M|||N||210148.0|0LP|FTR|1.0||SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS|Y|UNK|700 S.

I STARTED TO ITCH IMMEDIATELY, AND BECAME ALLERGIC TO MANY THINGS. MY BODY FELT FATIGUED, I HAD MIGRAINE HEADACHES, AND COULDN'T SLEEP. I BEGAN TO ACHE ALL OVER, HAD PANIC ATTACKS, MY VISION CHANGED RAPIDLY. I KEPT REPORTING VARIOUS COMPLAINTS TO MY PHYSICIANS, NO ONE COULD HELP ME, EVEN THOUGH THEY KEPT TRYING. I BECAME DEPRESSED, MY WHOLE BODY BEGAN TO CHANGE, MY BREASTS WERE ITCHING DEEP INSIDE, WERE COMPLETELY NUMB. THEY WERE HOT TO TOUCH, AND PAINFUL, I WAS TOLD IT WOULD GO AWAY. THE SYMPTOMS PROGRESSED RAPIDLY, EACH TIME THEY WENT BACK IN, THEY USED THE SAME IMPLANTS, EVEN REFILLED THE ONE THAT LEAKED. MY MAMMOGRAMS SHOWED A BULGE, THE RADIOLOGIST ADVISED ME TO REMOVE THEM, THE PLASTIC SURGEON DENIED WHAT THE FILM SHOWED. I HAD A SONOGRAM LATER, AND IT SHOWED MY LYMPH NODES WERE SWOLLEN. THEY IDENTIFIED GEL OUTSIDE OF THE CAPSULES. MY HEALTH WAS DECLINING RAPIDLY. THE NURSES TOLD ME ABOUT THE ADVERSE EFFECTS, TWO MONTHS BEFORE THIS LITIGATION WAS TO CLOSE. I HAD TO SEE AN INTERNAL SPECIALIST, WHO DIAGNOSED ME WITH SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS, SO DID A RHEUMATOLOGIST, AND SO DID A NEUROLOGIST. I HAVE SEIZURES, CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDER, ATYPICAL LUPUS, SJOGREN'S, RAYNAUD'S, NUMEROUS OTHER CONDITIONS. I HAVE BEEN HOSPITALIZED, GONE TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM, STAYED HOME BECAUSE I AM NOW UNEMPLOYABLE. NO ONE WILL INSURE ME NOW, AND THIS IS A PARTIAL LIST OF MY SYMPTOMS, AND DISORDERS. I AM POSITIVE MY PATHOLOGIST'S REPORT SHOWED A HOLE IN MY IMPLANT. MY VISION IS VERY IMPAIRED NOW. I CAN'T GET OUT OF BED, WITHOUT HELP, AND I AM CONSTANTLY ILL. I AM IN HORRENDOUS PAIN EACH DAY. MY MEMORY IS IMPAIRED SIGNIFICANTLY. I GET LOST, I CAN'T EVEN SHOP FOR GROCERIES, OR COOK A MEAL NOW. I DON'T GO INTO A DEEP SLEEP PATTERN, MY BRAIN STAYS ON RUN, WHILE MY BODY CRIES IN PAIN. MY LEGS AND FEET STAY SWOLLEN HUGE. MY FINGERS DON'T MOVE, I HAVE CRAMPS IN MY HANDS, LEGS, AND FEET THAT MAKE MY HANDS DRAW INTO GNARLS. I HAVE NIGHT SWEATS, MY FACE IS GETTING A PINK RASH OVER MY NOSE. MY BRAIN HAS ELECTRIC LIGHT SHOWS, AND I WAKE UP EXHAUSTED. MY WHOLE LIFE HAS CHANGED. MY IMMUNE SYSTEM IS COMPROMISED, I CAN'T BE AROUND ANYONE WHO IS ILL, OR I GET ILL. I'M SO ALLERGIC TO ALL CHEMICALS, I HAVE SEVERE REACTIONS TO THEM. MY VOICE HAS CHANGED, MY SPEECH IS SLURRED, I'M NOT ME NOW. MY FACE HAS BROKEN OUT IN BLISTERS, I'M ALLERGIC TO THE SUN, AND I HAVE ASTHMA NOW. I CAN'T BEGIN TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAS HAPPENED. I HAVE SOMEONE TYPING FOR ME, MY BRAIN CAN'T PUT THE WORDS TOGETHER NOW. I HAD NONE OF THESE PROBLEMS BEFORE IMPLANTS. I WAS NEVER TOLD OF THE CHEMICALS IN IMPLANTS. I WAS TOLD THAT IT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER TO DETECT BREAST CANCER. I HAD FIBRO-CYSTIC BREAST DISEASE. I AM POSITIVE THE IMPLANTS ARE WHAT HAS CAUSED ME TO BECOME EXTREMELY DISABLED, I AM FORCED TO FILE FOR DISABILITY. I WOULD RATHER BE THE PRODUCTIVE PERSON I WAS BEFORE I HAD SILICONE IMPLANTS. I RARELY AM ABLE TO GO OUT. I CAN'T HOLD MY GRANDBABIES OR PARTICIPATE IN A NORMAL LIFE. I AM SEXUALLY NOT A LADY NOW. I CAN'T HAVE A CLIMAX, MY VAGINA IS SO DRY, AND PAINFUL. WHY DID THE FDA ALLOW THIS? I THOUGHT IMPLANTS WERE SAFE, AND HAD BEEN APPROVED. NOW I'M READING I'VE BEEN TOXICALLY POISONED. I TRY TO USE MY MIND TO CONTROL PAIN. I AM ILL, I WANT TO BE WELL, I WANT TO BE FREE FROM ALL OF THE THINGS I HAVE WRONG WITH ME NOW. I TRY SO HARD, BUT I CAN'T DO THINGS. I WILL NEVER GIVE UP TRYING. I WISH I WAS WELL ENOUGH TO BE ME AGAIN NOW. I STAY AWAY FROM THE DOCTORS, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY MORE. I CAN'T HEAR WELL, AND I'M SO TIRED. I DON'T LEAD A NORMAL LIFE. I'M SICK, AND I'M JUST TRYING TO HIDE FROM ANY MORE TESTS, OR HOSPS. THESE CHEST PAINS WERE NEVER NORMAL FOR A 35 YEAR OLD LADY WHO EXERCIZED, WAS PHYSICALLY IN SHAPE. NOW I CAN'T RAISE MY ARMS, THE PAIN GOES FROM MY BREAST CLEAR DOWN TO MY FINGERTIPS. I CAN'T TELL YOU ANY MORE, IT'S TOO UPSETTING TO LOOK AT. I HAD A HYSTERECTOMY, I HEMORRHAGED FOR MONTHS. I'VE HAD A KIDNEY STONE, MY BLADDER IS BLOCKED, INFECTED ALL THE TIME, AND THEY CAN'T DO SURGERY. I HAVE A YEAST INFECTION CONTINUALLY. MY NAILS HAVE HAD A FUNGUS. MY SKIN HAS HUGE BLOOD PLACES THE SIZE OF A MAN'S HAND, ON MY FOREARMS ALWAYS, MY SKIN IS LIKE TISSUE PAPER. I FREEZE WHEN IT IS 90 DEGREES. SINUS, OH I COULD JUST KEEP GOING ON, AND ON BUT I WON'T. I THINK YOU HAVE READ ENOUGH. I'M BACK IN KINDERGARTEN, AND I WAS INTELLIGENT ONCE.

404770|270334|D|1||"PURE MEDICAL HEALTH PROBLEM, CAUSED BY A DUBIOUS MEDICAL DEVICE, WHICH MADE VICTIMS OF RPTR'S FAMILY AND RPTR. CHILDREN NEVER HAD A REAL PARENT, SPOUSE NEVER A SPOUSE. AFTER A CHRONIC BREAST INFECTION, RPTR GOT BREAST IMPLANTS ADVISED. SO, THEY COULD ""AT LEAST"" WEAR A BRA. RPTR REALLY LOVED THAT IDEA. SURGEON TOLD RPTR: ""WHEN YOU DIE AT, SAY 80, YOUR BREASTS WILL BE STAYING STRAIGHT AHEAD. NO BREAST PROBLEMS ANYMORE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE"". IT TURNED OUT TO BE A GREAT DISASTER. RPTR HAD 18 SURGERIES. PROSTHESIS IN/OUT, IN/OUT, TRANSPLANTATION OF OWN TISSUE (WITHOUT SUCCESS), ANOTHER RECONSTRUCTION-TRY, PROSTHESIS IN/OUT, ETC. WITHIN 3 YEARS, RPTR GOT RHEUMATISM (R.A.) DIAGNOSED (WAS FORCED TO MOVE INTO A SPECIAL HOUSE FOR DISABLED PEOPLE) AND A LOT OF OTHER DISEASES WHICH DIDN'T FIT THEM AT ALL. THEIR BODY TOLD ANOTHER TALE, SO EVERYTHING WAS ALL IN THEIR MIND. IN 1990 A RUPTURED IMPLANT WAS REMOVED AND A ""VERY SAFE"" THICK ONE RE-IMPLANTED. SPECIALIST ASSURED RPTR THAT THIS NEW DEVICE DIDN'T CAUSE PROBLEMS. RPTR RECOVERED, COULD WALK WITHOUT PAIN (MIRACLE). ALAS ONLY FOR 2 MOS. THE NEW (LOW BLEED) IMPLANT STARTED TO POISON RPTR'S BODY AGAIN AND MADE THEM SICK AS NEVER BEFORE. RPTR WAS COMPLETELY DISABLED AND HELPLESS. THE ONLY WAY TO SURVIVE WAS A RADICAL EXPLANTATION OF THIS SICK-MAKER, A VERY HARD DECISION. DURING THAT TIME RPTR LAID HANDS ON AN INTERESTING MEDICAL REPORT (PUBLICIZED IN 1987) ABOUT THE POSSIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN SILICONE AND IMMUNE DISORDERS LIKE RHEUMATISM, NAMED H.A.D., ILUMAN ADJUVANT DISEASE. RPTR COULD NOT AND STILL CANNOT FIND WORDS TO EXPRESS THEIR FEELINGS OF ANGER AND BETRAYAL. ALL THOSE LOST YEARS. ALL THIS PAIN, SCARS, DESPAIR. NOT ONLY FOR THEMSELF, ALSO FOR THEIR SPOUSE AND CHILDREN. BEFORE RPTR REALIZED IT THEY WERE THE ""HEAD OF A FAST GROWING SUPPORT GROUP FOR WOMEN WITH SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS, OFFICIALLY REGISTERED BY LAW 5/7/92. RPTR'S BODY LOOKED AWFUL; ONE BREAST WAS COMPLETELY GONE. SINCE RPTR STARTED THEIR CRUSADE THEY HAVE HEARD THE VERY SAME STORY OVER 4,000 TIMES. THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR RPTR. CONTACTED OTHER GROUPS AROUND THE WORLD, ONLY ""THE TONGUE"" WAS DIFFERENT, THE TALE THE VERY SAME. RPTR ALSO WROTE OR PHONED TO DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES ALL OVER THE WORLD TO INFORM THEMSELF AS WELL AS POSSIBLE. PLASTIC SURGEONS HARDLY INFORM THE WOMEN ABOUT POSSIBLE FUTURE HEALTH RISKS BOTH TO THEMSELVES AND THEIR YET UNBORN BABIES. THEY ONLY SHOW NICE PICTURES. ""SILICONE IS AN INERT MATERIAL, NO DANGER AT ALL! THE WORLDWIDE COMMOTION IS GOSSIP FROM HYSTERICAL WOMEN, OUT FOR MONEY. NOTHING SCIENTIFIC PROVEN, NO LINK IS FOUND TILL NOW, AS LONG AS IT ISN'T BANNED I GO ON!"", IS THEIR FAVORITE SLOGAN, IT IS POSSIBLE HERE TO BUY YOUR BREASTS NOW AND PAY MONTHLY, YOU CAN READ THAT IN ALL ADS IN ALL NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES. I THINK THAT IS A VERY HYPOCRITICAL WAY TO TRANSLATE THE OATH OF HYPOCRATIS, THE MAMMON ABOVE THE HUMAN BEINGS. SINCE THE START OF SUPPORT GROUP IN 1992 TILL NOW RPTR HAS ANSWERED OVER 20,000 TELEPHONE-CALLS (FROM 5 MINS TO 1 1/2 HRS OR EVEN MORE) AND HEARD MORE THAN 4,000 TIMES THE VERY SAME STORY, SOMETIMES ANONYMOUS. THEY ALL RECEIVED INFORMATION-PACKET TO HELP THEM TO FIND THEIR WAY. GROUP ALSO SENT THE WOMEN DIFFERENT QUESTIONNAIRES FOR MORE INVESTIGATION. THE FIRST ONE WITH ABOUT 100 ANSWER POSSIBILITIES. AGE OF THE WOMEN BETWEEN 17-78 YEARS. AGE OF IMPLANTS: ONE MONTH-35 YEARS. THE RESULTS WERE SHOCKING, BUT NOT SCIENTIFIC, THAT CAME LATER THANKS TO THE UNIVERSITY WHO ANALYZED ALL RESULTS. THE MOST SHOCKING PART, THE ANSWERS FROM MOTHERS WITH CHILDREN BEFORE AND AFTER THEIR IMPLANTS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE KIDS AND THEIR MEDICAL COMPLAINTS. OVER 199 CHILDREN ARE REGISTERED. FINDINGS WERE THE VERY SAME AS WRITTEN IN A CHILDREN HOSPITAL REPORT (1993). 83% OF THE WOMEN WHO CONTACTED SUPPORT GROUP DID HAVE MANY OF THE WELL-KNOWN DISEASES. THAT IS OVER 10% OF THE VALUED 30,000 WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS IN RTPR'S COUNTRY. 14% WANTED INFO ABOUT AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION. 2% DID NOT (YET) HAVE PROBLEMS. 1% WAS SUFFERING DUE TO OTHER MEDICAL DEVICES LIKE HIPS, TESTICLES, INJECTIONS, NEEDLES, ETC. OF THOSE 83% IS THE SCORE 99% WITH MUSCLE/JOINT PAINS, OFTEN FALSELY DIAGNOSED AS R.A. OR FIBROMYALGIA. CHRONIC FATIGUE: 98%. MEMORY LOSS, SHORT MEMORY AND BAD CONCENTRATION: 93%. MOST OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS (1487, ALL DOCUMENTED) SCORED HIGHER THAN 70%. BY EXPLANATION OVER 80% OF THE IMPLANTS WERE RUPTURED OR VISIBLY LEAKING/BLEEDING. THAT IS WHAT THE WOMEN TOLD RPTR, BUT MOSTLY NOT WRITTEN IN THEIR FILES NOR REGISTERED. 40% OF THE EXPLANTED WOMEN RECOVERED QUITE A LOT WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR. ABOUT 45% NEEDED 2 TO 5 YEARS TO FEEL BETTER. THE OTHERS, ALAS, HAVE PASSED THE WAY OF NO RETURN. NO IDEA HOW LONG THEY'LL STAY AMONG THEM. 15-20 LADIES ARE TERRIBLY SICK, GOING DOWN HILL DAILY, SOME ARE TERMINAL BY NOW. 7 TIMES THEY FOUND A TUMOR TOO LATE (AS FAR AS RPTR HAS HEARD). 16 LADIES ALREADY DIED, WITHOUT KNOWING WHY. FIVE OF THEM RPTR KNEW VERY WELL, ALMOST TILL THE VERY LAST MINUTE. ONE COMMITTED SUICIDE, 34 YEARS OLD. THEY COULD NOT STAND THE PAIN ANYMORE AND THEIR MAIMED BODY. BUT MOST OF THE IMPLANTS WERE RUPTURED (ENVELOPE GONE) OR THERE WAS VISIBLE BLEEDING. THERE ARE ALSO 2 BABIES RPTR KNOWS ABOUT. ONE CHOKED IN MUCUS AFTER BEING BREASTFED, ONLY 6 WEEKS OLD. THE OTHER ONE BLED TO DEATH, 2 WEEKS BEFORE BIRTH. NO REASON FOUND. ONLY A STRANGE DISORDER IN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. HEALTH GOVERNMENT DOESN'T TAKE ALL COMPLAINTS SERIOUSLY; THEY DON'T REALIZE THE REALITY IS EVEN MORE THAN WORSE. THEY HARDLY LISTEN TO RPTR. THEY EVEN DON'T BELIEVE RPTR AND DO NOTHING FOR THE SICK WOMEN, CHILDREN AND MEN. NO MEDICATION, NO TREATMENT, NO HELP AT ALL FOR THIS BETRAYED POPULATION. RPTR THINKS ALL THEIR HEALTH MINISTERS ARE RESPONSIBLE. THEY ALLOW DUBIOUS MEDICAL DEVICES ON THE MARKETS; THE VERY SAME DEVICE THAT IS BANNED IN AMERICA AND OTHER COUNTRIES SINCE 1992."|SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT|NI|07/10/2002|*|||*||393767.0|*|FTR|1.0||LOW BLEED SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT|Y|NI|UNK||UNK|*|UNK|||||NI|NI|True

487721|302479|D|1||"PT WAS RAISED ON A RANCH AND PT OWNED A RANCH MOST OF THEIR ADULT LIFE. PT WAS A VERY HARD WORKER AND PT WAS HARDLY SICK A DAY IN THEIR LIFE. IN 1990 PT HAD REMARRIED AND THOUGHT THEY NEEDED TO LOOK YOUNGER, SO THEY OPTED TO GET SILICONE BREAST IMPALNTS. PT HAD TALKED TO A PLASTIC SURGEON AND HE TOLD THEM THEY WERE SAFE AND THEY WOULD LAST PT'S LIFETIME. HE TOLD THEM THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD RUPTURE THEM WOULD BE A CAR WRECK OR SOME OTHER HARD BLOW. SO, IN 1990 PT HAD MCGHAN SILICONE IMPLANTS IMPLANTED. PT HAD BEEN WORKING IN CLOTHING FACTORY FOR THREE YEARS AT THE TIME PT GOT THE SILICONE IMPLANTS. PT LOVED THEIR JOB AND HAD NEVER MISSED A DAY OF WORK DUE TO ILLNESS. WITHIN FOUR MONTHS OF GETTING THE IMPLANTS PT NOTICED THEY WERE ACHING ALL OVER AND HAD DEVELOPED HEADACHES. THEY WENT BACK TO THE SURGEON WHO THEY HAD GOTTEN THE IMPLANTS FROM AND TOLD HIM THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE MAKING PT SICK. HE TOLD PT THEY WERE LISTENING TOO MUCH TO THE MEDIA AND HE SAW NO REASON TO REMOVE THEM. HE SAID HE SERIOUSLY DOUBTED THE IMPLANTS HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH PT'S ILLNESS. HE TOLD PT THEY HAD MORE RISK FROM GETTING AN INFECTION FROM THE EXPLANTATION THAN THE IMPLANTS HARMING PT. PT BELIEVED HIM AND LEFT THEM IN. PT BECAME MORE ILL AND THE HEADACHES BECAME ALMOST UNBEARABLE. PT MISSED WORK WEEKLY. PT STARTED HAVING SUCH BACK PAIN WITH THE HEADACHES THAT THEY HAD TO QUIT THEIR JOB. IN THE NEXT YEAR PT HAD TO HAVE BACK SURGERY. PT HAD BECOME SO ILL THAT THEY WERE PUT ON SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY. IN THE MID NINETIES PT'S NASAL PASSAGES STARTED BURNING AND THEIR NOSE WAS SWELLING SHUT, IN ADDITION TO THE HORRIBLE HEADACHES. BY THEN THE HEADACHES WERE SO BAD THAT PT HAD TO GO TO ER WITH THEM. THEIR GP SENT PT TO A NEUROLOGIST WHO DID MANY TESTS AND SENT PT TO AN ENT. PT ENDED UP GOING TO THREE ENTS AND HAVING THREE SINUS SURGERIES. THEY ALL TOLD PT THAT SOMETHING WAS INFLAMING THEIR NASAL PASSAGES. THEY TOLD PT THAT IF PT DIDN'T FIND OUT WHAT THEIR BODY WAS REACTING TO, THEY COULDN'T HELP PT. PT WENT TO AN ALLERGIST AND HE FOUND NO ALLERGIES. PT TOLD THEIR SPOUSE MANY TIMES THAT THEY FELT LIKE THEY WERE BEING POISONED. PT HAD THE HOUSE CHECKED FOR ANY TOXINS. SPOUSE CHECKED THE VEHICLES. BY NOW, THEY WERE FEELING MUCH WORSE. THEY FELT DIZZY AND NAUSEATED OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, PT WENT TO MANY DRS. PT WENT TO OTHER FACILITY AND THEY TOLD PT THEIR ILLNESS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THEIR IMPLANTS. PT WENT TO ANOTHER FACILITY AND THEY BOTH TOLD PT THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THEM. PT FOUND ALL THE DRS THAT THEY WENT TO, HEDGING AROUND THE SILICONE SUBJECT. IT WAS LIKE THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. SO THEY JUST SENT PT ON THEIR WAY. PT WAS BECOMING SO VERY FRUSTRATED AND ALONE. THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS PT BECAME SO ILL THEY ARE ALMOST BEDRIDDEN. THEIR NASAL PASSAGES BURN ALL THE TIME AND THEIR HEADACHES ARE CONSTANT. PT CAN HARDLY WALK AS THEIR LEGS AND FEET SWELL AND THEY ACHE ALL OVER. PT IS DIZZY AND NAUSEATED. PT HAS LOST MUCH OF THEIR SHORT-TERM MEMORY. PT HAS DEVELOPED AN IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT. PT FEELS ELECTRIC JOLTS SHOOTING THROUGH THEIR BRAIN. SOME TIMES THEY FEEL LIKE THEY WILL PASS OUT. THEY SWEAT SO BADLY DAY AND NIGHT THAT THEY HAVE TO CHANGE BEDDING AND CLOTHES CONSTANTLY. OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THEY HAVE BECOME INTOLERANT OF MOST CHEMICALS. THEY CAN'T CONSUME OR BREATH ANY CHEMICAL WITHOUT BECOMING EXTREMELY ILL. IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR, THEY FINALLY DECIDED THEY WERE GOING TO DIE IF THEY DIDN'T DO SOMETHING. THE DRS WERE NOT ABLE TO HELP PT. THEY EITHER WEREN'T ABLE TO OR WERE UNWILLING, DUE TO THEIR LACK OF THE PROPER FACTS. DUE TO THE CHEMICAL REACTION, PT DECIDED ON THEIR OWN THAT IT WAS THE SILICONE. PT DOSEN'T CARE HOW MANY DRS TOLD THEM IT WASN'T THE SILICONE. PT KNOWS IT IS. IN AUGUST OF THIS YEAR PT WENT TO A VERY GOOD PLASTIC SURGEON AND SHE TOOK THE IMPLANTS OUT. SHE FOUND THE LEFT IMPANT RUPTURED. SHE SAID THERE WAS VERY LITTLE SILICONE ACTUALLY LEFT IN THE CASE. THE SILICONE HAD MIGRATED DOWN INTO PT'S CHEST AND INTO PT'S LYMPH NODES. THEY DESCRIBED IT AS ""A STICKY MESS"". SHE ALSO REMOVED THE LYMPH NODES WITH SILICONE IN THEM. AT THAT TIME SHE TOLD PT ""THERE WAS PROBABLY SILICONE IN THEIR LIVER, LUNGS AND BRAIN"". THE RIGHT IMPLANT WAS INTACT. PT HAS NO IDEA HOW LONG THE LEFT IMPLANT HAD BEEN RUPTURED. SINCE PT IS DISABLED AND ON MEDICARE, PT HAD TO PAY FOR THE EXPLANTATION. SPOUSE HAD TO TAKE OFF FROM WORK TO TAKE PT AND THEY LOST 10 DAYS OF WORK. IT COSTS THEM $15,000 FOR THE SURGERY, GAS, MOTELS AND LOSS OF SPOUSE'S WAGES. FAMILY USED THEIR SAVING TO PAY FOR THE SURGERY AND TRIP EXPENSES. PT FEELS THEY HAVE LOST THE LAST 13 YEARS OF THEIR LIFE. IF THE DR HAD NOT TOLD PT THEIR ILLNESS WAS NOT CAUSED BY THE SILICONE IMPLANTS, PT WOULD HAVE HAD THEM OUT MANY YEARS AGO AND COULD HAVE SAVED MUCH MORE OF THEIR HEALTH. IT TAKES MANY YEARS TO TEST TO SEE IF A PRODUCT IS SAFE. PT FEELS MANY OF US HAVE BEEN THE GUINEA PIGS. AND PT FEELS IT IS PROVEN THAT SILICONE IS NOT SAFE. IT'S TOO LATE TO DO MUCH FOR PEOPLE LIKE PT, BUT LET'S PLEASE SAVE THE NEXT GENERATION. THERE ARE SO MANY WOMEN OUT HERE SUFFERING IN SILENCE AND FEELING LOST, HELPLESS AND BETRAYED. PLEASE DO ANYTHING YOU CAN TO STOP THE PEOPLE FROM BRINGING THEIR PRESCRIPTIONS BACK FROM CANADA BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID THE DRUGS WEREN'T SAFE. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE CLAIMING TO BE ILL FROM THAT? PT FEELS NO ONE SEEMS TO CARE THAT SILICONE IS POISONING WOMEN BY THE THOUSANDS."|MCGHAN|*|09/13/2003|V|||Y||476585.0|0HP|FTR|1.0||SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS|Y|CY6259|*||*|*|MCGHAN|||||*|NO. 25-45361|True

I NEVER HAVE REDNESS OR SWELLING OVER AFFECTED JOINTS. BURNING AND TINGLING REMAINS EVEN THOUGH I AM TAKING MY NEURONTIN. IN 07/2005, I SEE A SPECIALIST AND A RHENUMATOLOGIST. HE DIAGNOSES AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE CALLED SJOGREN'S SYNDROME. HE PUTS ME ON 1200 MG PER DAY OF NEURONTIN, 400 MG PER DAY OF PLAQUENIL, VITAMIN B6. AMBIEN TO GET TO SLEEP, TRAZADONE TO KEEP ME ASLEEP. NOW I AM ON ANTI-ANXIETY MEDICINE AS WELL. 3 WEEKS AGO MY GP SENT ME TO A DERMATOLOGIST WHO BIOPSIED MY RASHES AND SAYS I AM HAVING AN INTERNAL ALLERGIC REACITON.

THIS TIME ON RIGHT ANKLE AND ON LEFT PALM OF HAND NEAR THUMB. 01/2005: OUT OF THE BLUE I DEVELOP A HORRIBLE BLADDER/KIDNEY INFECTION. URINE SMELLS LIKE BURNT RUBBER OR BURNT HAIR AND IS DARK WITH BLOOD. I'M BEGINNING TO HAVE ABDOMINAL PAIN SO I GO TO DR. SHE SPENDS TIME GOING OVER ALL OF MY SYMPTOMS AND TELLS ME SHE THINKS I NEED TO HAVE MY IMPLANTS REMOVED. LEFT SIDE LOWERMOST RIB PAIN CONTINUES SPORADICALLY. I'LL HAVE IT FOR 2 DAYS, IT'LL DISAPEAR FOR 10 AND THEN IT COMES BACK FOR A DAY AND DISAPPEARS. IT DOESN'T HURT TO PRESS ON IT. I HAVE HAD X-RAYS. NOTHING. SOMETIMES WHEN I WAKE UP I HAVE TO FEEL MY HANDS IN THE DARK TO MAKE SURE MY FINGERS ARE STILL THERE. MY FIRST 4 FINGERS ARE COMPLETELY NUMB ON BOTH HANDS. LITTLE FINGER IS NOT. MY B12 WAS TESTED 6 MONTHS AGO BUT I HAD TAKEN A B12 VITAMIN A FEW HRS BEFORE. STILL, THE TEST WAS NORMAL. MY LYMPH NODES ARE NEVER SWOLLEN AND I DON'T HAVE HEADACHES. I NEVER HAVE REDNESS OR SWELLING OVER AFFECTED JOINTS. BURNING AND TINGLING REMAINS EVEN THOUGH I AM TAKING MY NEURONTIN. IN 07/2005, I SEE A SPECIALIST AND A RHENUMATOLOGIST. HE DIAGNOSES AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE CALLED SJOGREN'S SYNDROME. HE PUTS ME ON 1200 MG PER DAY OF NEURONTIN, 400 MG PER DAY OF PLAQUENIL, VITAMIN B6. AMBIEN TO GET TO SLEEP, TRAZADONE TO KEEP ME ASLEEP. NOW I AM ON ANTI-ANXIETY MEDICINE AS WELL. 3 WEEKS AGO MY GP SENT ME TO A DERMATOLOGIST WHO BIOPSIED MY RASHES AND SAYS I AM HAVING AN INTERNAL ALLERGIC REACITON. I THINK THIS POINTS TO THE IMPLANTS AGAIN.

1192244|15010491|D|1||"I AM WRITING TODAY TO LET YOU KNOW, THAT I WAS DAMAGED BY MENTOR BREAST IMPLANTS. I WILL TRY TO MAKE THIS SHORT AND TO THE POINT. I AM A WIFE AND MOTHER. TWENTY YEARS AGO, I GOT MY 1ST IMPLANTS (SILICONE). AFTER A FEW YEARS I GOT A ""CAPSULE"" AND LIVED WITH IT UNTIL THE FOLLOWING FIVE YEARS. AT THAT POINT, I WENT TO DR AND HAD THEM REPLACED WITH ANOTHER SET OF SILICONE IMPLANTS. I FEEL THAT HE DID A VERY GOOD JOB AND WAS HAPPY WITH THEM FOR ALMOST 10 YEARS. IN 2004, I STARTED FEELING SICK, IN MANY WAYS AND MY IMPLANTS FELT DIFFERENT TO ME. I FELT STRONGLY THAT ONE OR BOTH HAD BURST BUT BECAUSE OF LACK OF FUNDS I WAS UNABLE TO FIND OUT OR HAVE THEM REPLACED. EVER SINCE THE SPRING/SUMMER OF 2004, I ""MYSTERIOUSLY"" DEVELOPED VITILIGO (A VERY RARE DISEASE. ESPECIALLY IN CAUCASIANS). I ALSO CAME DOWN WITH INFECTION AFTER INFECTION, AFTER INFECTION, WITH NO BREAKS. MY DOCTORS RAN COUNTLESS TESTS AND COULD NOT FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING. I WAS TESTED FOR AIDS, HIV, LUPUS, STRESS ECO, ULTRA SOUNDS, THYROID, ETC... TOO MANY TO NOTE HERE. I WOULD GLADLY GIVE YOU PERMISSION TO TALK TO MY DOCTOR WHO HAS YET TO FIGURE OUT WHY I WAS BEING PLAGUED WITH ALL THIS ILLNESS. I ALSO CAME DOWN WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AT THAT SAME TIME. I WAS CONSTANTLY EXHAUSTED AND TORTURED BY MY ILLNESSES AND NOT KNOWING WHY. I WAS ON MANY ANTIBIOTICS EVERY 2-3 WEEKS, MOSTLY CIPRO, FROM 2004-2006. THE DEPRESSION I HAVE SUFFERED AND TIME LOST COULD NEVER BE REPLACED OR PAID FOR. IN 2006, I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO AFFORD TO HAVE THEM REPLACED BY DR. WHEN I EXPRESSED TO HIM THAT I FELT MY IMPLANTS HAD RUPTURED AND CAUSED MY ILLNESS HE SUDDENLY REFUSED TO DO MY SURGERY. HIS PARTNER DR AGREED TO DO THE SURGERY AND AFTER THE SURGERY ADMITTED THAT THE LONGEST AND MOST DIFFICULT PART OF THE SURGERY WAS REMOVING LARGE AMOUNTS OF SILICONE FROM MY BODY. HIS EXACT WORDS WERE THAT ""IT WAS A MESS."" THE DAY I LEFT HIS OFFICE THAT DAY, I HAVEN'T HAD ANYMORE INFECTIONS. HOWEVER, THE VITILIGO REMAINS AND IS GETTING WORSE. I BELIEVE THAT REGARDING THAT, THE DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE AND CANNOT BE REVERSED. I FEEL MUCH BETTER SINCE THEY WERE REMOVED AND REPLACED. ALMOST A YEAR AFTER MY SURGERY, I CALLED FOR A CHECK UP, TO MAKE SURE THEY LOOKED RIGHT AND WERE AS THEY SHOULD BE. ONE DAY AFTER THAT I RECEIVED A CALL FROM DR'S OFFICE AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD FORGOTTEN TO HAVE ME SIGN A CONSENT FORM BEFORE MY SURGERY (ALMOST A YEAR BEFORE) AND THAT THEY WERE SENDING IT TO ME IN THE MAIL TO SIGN AND SEND BACK TO THEM. THE FORM WAS FOR MY CONSENT TO HAVE MENTOR IMPLANTS PUT IN MY BODY AND BE PART OF THEIR STUDY. I NEVER RECEIVED OR SAW THIS PRIOR TO MY SURGERY. IF I HAD SEEN THAT IT WAS THE SAME COMPANY, THAT I STRONGLY BELIEVE, MADE ME SICK, I MAY HAVE CHOSEN ANOTHER OPTION. I WAS NOT GIVEN A CHOICE AND I AM NOW ""PART OF A STUDY"".

1249543|974111|D|1||"GUMMY IMPLANTS CLINICAL STUDY FOR INAMED CORP. STYLE 410 SILICONE FILLED BREAST IMPLANT. NOTE: I HAVE NOT BEEN ASKED TO COME FOR ANY F/U VISITS, I HAVE NOT BEEN ASKED TO COMPETE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FORMS - 3- PRE-. EVEN THOUGH I HAVE CONTRACTED AN AUTO IMMUNE DISORDER. I HAVE HAD 2 BAD INFECTIONS. I HAVE NOT BEEN ASKED TO DO ANY KIND OF MRI TO DETERMINE IF PERHAPS A RUPTURE IS CAUSING MY DISORDER, OR IF A RUPTURE IS CAUSING MY INFECTIONS. GIVEN THIS IS A CLINICAL STUDY, I WOULD THINK THIS WOULD BE A NORMAL COURSE OF ACTION. IN 2008, I WENT TO MY DR DUE TO ISSUES WITH MY LEFT BREAST. IT WAS INFLAMED AND VERY RED. HE PRESCRIBED ANTIBIOTICS. AT THIS TIME IT WAS MENTIONED THAT I HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH THE AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE, BUT NOTHING WAS WRITTEN DOWN THAT I SAW, I WAS NOT ASKED TO COMPLETE FORM 3 PRE FOR QUAL OF LIFE -AS DETAILED IN THE FDA'S DOCUMENTATION-. THERE WAS NO MRI TAKEN. I WILL NOTE THAT I HAD BEEN HOSPITALIZED, DUE TO CELLULITIS IN THE PREVIOUS MONTH, SO PERHAPS THE THOUGHT WAS THAT MY INFECTION IN MY BREAST WAS A RESULT OF THE PREVIOUS INFECTION. HOWEVER, MY EXPECTATION GIVEN THE FACT THAT I AM IN A CLINICAL STUDY, AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT I HAD TOLD DR WEISER THAT I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH THE DISORDER, WOULD LEAD ME TO BELIEVE THAT FURTHER DATA GATHERING AND ANALYSIS WOULD START TAKING PLACE. SIX MONTHS LATER, I CAME DOWN WITH YET ANOTHER INFECTION. I HAD ALSO BEEN DIAGNOSED EARLIER IN THE YEAR WITH MIXED CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDER IN ADDITION TO THE ELEVATED ANA, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS OVERLAPPING IMMUNE DISORDER. DR WEISER AGAIN ORDERED ANTIBIOTICS. WHEN TOLD ABOUT THE LUPUS - HIGH ANA- DR STATED ""THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT IMPLANTS CAUSE LUPUS"". AGAIN, I WAS NOT GIVEN THE QUAL OF LIFE FORM TO COMPLETE, I WAS NOT ASKED FOR MY RHEUMATOLOGIST'S NAME, THERE WAS NO SCRIPT TO MY RHEUMY TO DO ANY ADD'L TEST FOR SILICONE ANTIBODIES, FOR SILICONE IN THE BLOOD, OR TO OBTAIN COPIES OF MY BLOOD WORK TO PUT IN MY FILE. AND, THERE WAS NO MRI ORDERED. I WAS NOT ASKED TO COME BACK AFTER THE VISIT - EXCEPT FOR POST SURGICAL F/U, I AM NEVER COMMUNICATED WITH OR NEVER HAVE F/U VISITS SCHEDULED. THE FOLLOWING MONTH, I CALLED MY DR. TO LET THEM KNOW THAT I WANTED MY IMPLANTS REMOVED -EXPLANTED-. AGAIN, THERE WAS NO ORDER OF AN MRI BEFORE REMOVAL. I HAVE MY APPOINTMENT WITH THE DR THE FOLLOWING MONTH, AND THE REMOVAL IS SCHEDULED FOR EIGHT DAYS LATER. GIVEN THE SCHEDULING OF SUCH PROCEDURES, I WOULD THINK THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TOLD ME TO GET AN MRI. THERE AGAIN WAS NO REQUEST FOR BLOOD WORK FROM MY RHEUMATOLOGIST, OR A SCRIPT FOR ANY ADD'L BLOOD WORK. AGAIN - THERE WAS NO REQUEST TO COME IN AND COMPLETE THE QUAL OF LIFE FORM. I AM SOMEWHAT UPSET. WHEN DR. WEISER STATED ""THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT IMPLANTS CAUSE LUPUS"" MY FIRST THOUGHT NOW IS, WELL IF THE DRS ARE NOT REPORTING ANYTHING, NO WONDER THERE IS NO EVIDENCE. IF IT WERE NOT FOR ME FORCING THE ISSUE. I INTEND TO MAKE A REQUEST FOR MY MEDICAL FILE TO SEE WHAT IS BEING REPORTED MONTHLY, AND I INTEND TO SPEAK WITH AN ATTORNEY BECAUSE IF THIS IS HOW ""CLINICAL TRIALS"" ARE CONDUCTED, THEN THIS IS A FARCE, AND WOMEN ARE SUFFERING. THE MOCKERY ABOUT THE AUTO IMMUNE DISORDER AND LACK OF PROOF IN PARTICULAR IS WHAT MAKES ME MOST ANGRY, I AM LIVING PROOF. I AM TAKING THE LEAD TO ASK MY RHEUMATOLOGIST TO CONDUCT FURTHER TESTING, AND ASKING MY ONCOLOGIST TO ORDER THE MRI. I AM BEING MY OWN ADVOCATE, AND HOPEFULLY WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE INFO THAT IS USEFUL. COMMON SENSE SAYS: SILICONE IS A TOXIN USED IN PESTICIDES AND WAS CONSIDERED FOR CHEMICAL WARFARE BY DOW. DOW DIDN'T COVER UP A NUMBER OF FINDINGS BECAUSE THEY FELT SILICONE WAS SAFE. ALL OF THE CYA AND VOLUNTARY FORMS DO NOT TAKE AWAY THE FACT THAT SILICONE IS A TOXIN THAT CAUSES HARM TO THE BODY."|INAMED CORPORATION STYLE 410 SILICONE-FILLED BREAST||11/24/2008||||Y|||0HP|FTR|1.0||GUMMY BEAR IMPLANT|||||||INAMED CORP|||||||True

885245|19252514|D|1||"I RECEIVED THE SILICON ""GUMMY BEAR"" BREAST IMPLANTS IN 2005. THE FIRST PROBLEM THAT NO ONE HAD ADVISED ME ABOUT, IS THAT UPON WAKING UP FROM SURGERY, AND FROM THEN ON, THERE IS A REAL REDUCTION OF THE MUSCLES IN MY ARMS, GIVING A MUCH WEAKER ARMS MOBILITY AND CONTROL, AFFECTING DRIVING, LIFTING ETC. THEN AT ABOUT FOUR WEEKS LATER AFTER THE SURGERY I STARTED TO HAVE STRONG SHOOTING PAIN IN MY WRISTS AND FEET AND KNEES. I FELT OFTEN TIRED AND ALSO GOT SICK EASILY. I STARTED TO GET OUT OF BED USING KNUCKLES AND CLOSED FIST TO PUSH UP -TO REDUCE THE PAIN- AS TO AVOID PUTTING PRESSURE ON MY PAINFUL WRISTS. THEN IT STARTED TO BE A PROBLEM TO WORK OUT AT THE GYM BECAUSE OF THE PAIN IN THE BOWL OF THE FOOT, AND TO STAY IN CLASS FOR LONG HOURS. I WAS WORKING AS A TEACHER. IN 2006, I STARTED TO HAVE ASTHMA THAT WAS VERY DISTURBING AT NIGHT, THEN COUGH, AND APNEA EPISODES AND HAD TO TAKE TIME OFF WORK AND MORE MEDICAL EXPENSES. AT ABOUT ONE MONTH LATER, I HAD A STAPH INFECTION ON MY NECK THAT REQUIRED A SHOT AT THE EMERGENCY ROOM, BECAUSE I HAD CHEST PRESSURE AND COULDN'T BREATHE WELL. THE STAPH SKIN INFECTION TOOK TWO ROUNDS OF ANTIBIOTICS TO CLEAR. SINCE 2005, I ALSO EXPERIENCED RASHES ON MY CHESTS THAT I NEVER HAD BEFORE. THE RED PATCHES-RASHES HAVE DIFFERENT SHAPES, SOMETIMES GEOMETRIC SOMETIMES THE SIZE OF A SNAIL, AND THEY COME AND GO WITHIN TWO TO FIVE DAYS, AND I WEAR NECK HIGH SHIRTS, MAKING IT VERY UNCOMFORTABLE IN THIS HEAT. I ALSO NOTICED A DRAMATIC CHANGE IN THE SHAPE AND COLOR OF THE MOLES ON MY SKIN -MIGRATION, DARKER- AND MY SKIN SENSITIVITY, WITH SOME PARTS OF MY SKIN FEELING NUMB OR LESS SENSITIVE AROUND MY CHEST AND ARMS. THE DERMATOLOGIST I CONSULTED DIDN'T IDENTIFY THEM WITH A PARTICULAR TREATMENT BUT TRIED TO SELL ME SEVERAL LASER REJUVENATING TREATMENTS. EACH DOCTOR I CONSULTED IN THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF TOLD ME THAT MY SYMPTOMS WERE UNLIKELY RELATED TO THE SILICON IMPLANTS BECAUSE THE FDA REPORTED THEM SAFE AND THERE WOULD BE NO FURTHER QUESTION ABOUT IT. I CONSULTED MANY DOCTORS, AND RAN MANY BLOOD AND URINE TESTS, HIPS AND HANDS X-RAYS, IMPLANTS X-RAYS, CHIROPRACTOR SESSIONS, ACUPUNCTURE, ""AYURVEDIC"" -OUT OF FRUSTRATION- BUT NOTHING HAS RELIEVED ME FROM THE SHOOTING PAIN. THE BLOOD TESTS RESULTS DIDN'T SHOW ANY INFLAMMATION IN MY SYSTEM. PAIN COMES AND GOES, AND ACUPUNCTURE HELPS ONLY FOR A SHORT TIME. AT NIGHT I WAKE UP, COMPLETE AWAKE SOMETIMES AT 2AM OR 4AM AND CANNOT GO BACK TO SLEEP, AND USE THE RESTROOM SEVERAL TIMES AT NIGHT, UNABLE TO GET A COMPLETE EMPTYING FEELING, WITH A SLOW FLOW, WHICH IS ALSO SOMETHING I NEVER DEALT WITH BEFORE. I HAVE SHOOTING PAIN IN MY KNEES AND HIPS, AND SOMETIMES SMALL BONES TOES AS IF A METAL PIN WAS SHOVED WITH FORCE. I HAVE CONSULTED A LOCAL SURGEON ABOUT ONE MONTH LATER, WHO TOLD ME THAT HE'D HELP ME REMOVE THE IMPLANTS BUT I DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCE TO PAY FOR SURGERY. THE NEW SURGEON I CONSULTED RECENTLY SAID THAT HE PERFORMED ALREADY ABOUT 300 EXPLANTATIONS ""EN BLOC"" AND THAT THE WOMEN PRESENTED HEALTH COMPLAINTS SIMILAR TO MINE WITH 2/3 SUCCESS RATE OF HEALTH REVERSAL TO COMPLETE GOOD HEALTH AS THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY TO THE IMPLANTS INSERTION. AT AN URGENT CARE AT ONE VERY PAINFUL EVENT, I WAS PRESCRIBED PAIN KILLERS AND ANTIDEPRESSANTS, AS THERE ARE NO TESTS FOR MIGRATING SILICON. I HAVE NOT TAKEN THE ANTIDEPRESSANTS AS IT IS NOT GOING TO ALLEVIATE THE PAIN IN MY JOINTS, GIVING MY SIGHT BACK, ALLEVIATE MY FINGER BONES PAIN AND NUMBNESS OR GIVE ME MY HEALTH AND STRENGTH BACK. SINCE 2007, THINGS SEEM TO HAVE PRECIPITATED WITH MY HEALTH, ADDING TO THE PREVIOUS PROBLEMS. BECAUSE I WAS ALWAYS FEELING SO TIRED, AND NOT GETTING ENOUGH REST AND WAKING UP AT NIGHT, I DECIDED TO LEAVE MY TEACHING POSITION AND WORK FROM HOME AND HAVE A SLOWER PACE AND GET MORE REST WHEN I NEED IT. I HAVE NEW SYMPTOMS SINCE 2007 AS FOLLOW: MY FINGER TIPS ARE NUMB AND I HAVE CHEST PAIN WHEN I BREATHE, ESPECIALLY WHEN I AM LAYING IN BED, AND MY LOWER LEGS AND TOES GET NUMB WHICH MAKE ME WANT TO MOVE AROUND AND CHANGE POSITION AS TO HELP MY BODY BLOOD CIRCULATION. I HAVE NEW BURNING SENSATION PATCHES ON MY ARMS THAT ALSO SEEM TO COME AND GO. WHEN I TAKE A DEEP BREATH MY BACKBONE EXTENDS AND MAKES A LOUD POPPING SOUND. IT'S QUIET SCARY, ESPECIALLY WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING. I HAVE SORES IN MY MOUTHS THAT COME AND GO BETWEEN TWO MONTHS IN 2007, AND NOW MY VISION IS SUDDENLY BLURRY, I CANNOT READ WELL REGULAR PRINT CLOSE OR DISTANT. IT'S REALLY SCARY. ALTHOUGH THE SCARIEST PART IS THAT MY SKELETON IS PERFORMING DIFFERENTLY. THE JOINTS IN HIPS AND KNEES, HANDS, FINGERS, AND TOES STARTED ACTING UP, BUT IN THE LAST FOUR MONTHS IT PRECIPITATED TO ALL THE OTHER ONES WITH A LOUD POPPING SOUND, IN MY BACK ESPECIALLY, MANDIBLE, SHOULDERS, AND THE NECK -MAKES A WHOOSHING SOUND.- I HAVE PUT ON 15 POUNDS SINCE RECEIVING THE IMPLANTS, AND I AM UNABLE TO GO THE GYM AS I USED TO OR TO RUN ANY LONGER BECAUSE OF PAIN IN FEET, TOES, AND KNEES. LOOKING BACK AT THIS ONE YEAR AND A HALF I HAVE SPENT 35-45% OF MY WORKING TIME MEETING DOCTORS, MANAGING THE SHOOTING PAIN, DOING REPETITIVE AND INCONCLUSIVE LAB TESTS, TAKING LONG NAPS, DEALING WITH SLEEP INTERRUPTION AND URINE AND KIDNEY TRACK PROBLEM SOLVING, AND SEARCHING FOR FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THE ONLY PROBLEM THAT IS VERY EVIDENT, THE SILICON -GUMMY BEAR- IN MY BREASTS IMPLANTS ARE MAKING ME VERY SICK."|GUMMY BEARS||07/20/2007||||N|||0|FTR|1.0||BREAST IMPLANTS|||||||nan|||||||True

2163607|2106125|D|1||"I'M WRITING MY STORY TO THE FDA. THIS IS ABOUT MY BREAST SILICONE IMPLANTS THAT HAVE BEEN BLEEDING OUT FOR 7 OR MORE YEARS. I STARTED TO CONTINUALLY TO BE SICK WITH SYMPTOMS LIKE: LOW GRADE FEVERS 99.6 TO 100.8 (ALL THE TIME), FATIGUE, SWOLLEN LYMPH NODES, FLU-LIKE SYMPTOMS, NIGHT SWEATS, INSOMNIA, BACKACHES, WEIGHT LOSS, WEIGHT GAIN, BONES HURTING, CANKER SORES IN MY MOUTH FOR 4 MONTHS AND ON AND OFF FOR 2 YEARS, LARGE SUB LINGUAL TONSILS, COUGHING, WEAKNESS, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, CHEST PAINS, PAIN DEEP IN THE BONES, MEMORY LOSS. UNTIL (B)(6) 2007, WHEN MY BLOOD PRESSURE WENT UP AND I STARTED GETTING CHEST PAINS, THEN I SAW MY CARDIOLOGIST. HE RAN ALL THE TESTS, ECHO, THALLIUM TREADMILL AND BP MONITOR WITH BLOOD TESTS. ALL THE TESTS CAME BACK NEGATIVE EXCEPT FOR MY CRP, IT WAS 20.6. THIS HAD MY CARDIOLOGIST CONCERNED. HE ASKED THAT I RETURNED IN 2 MONTHS FOR A REPEAT TEST TO SEE IF IT WAS STILL HIGH 20.1. IN (B)(6), THE TEST WAS REPEATED WITH THE SAME RESULT 20.1. SENT ME FOR A CHEST CT SCAN. CAME BACK ABNORMAL AGAIN. MY CT SHOWED MANY SPOTS WITH INFILTRATES IN BOTH LUNGS AND PATCHY SPOTS WITH ABNORMAL LYMPH NODES. HE REFERRED ME TO A PULMONOLOGIST; SHE SAID I NEED A LYMPH NODE BIOPSY IN MY AXILLARY'S NODES, WANTED TO R/O LYMPHOMA. SHE HAD MORE BLOOD TEST DONE AND MY CPR WAS UP TO 43 AND SED RATE WAS UP, WBC WAS UP, BLOOD WORK IS STARTING TO COME BACK ABNORMAL. SHE REFERRED ME TO A GENERAL SURGEON TO PERFORM THE BIOPSY AND THE BIOPSY CAME BACK SHOWING SILICONE IN THE LYMPH NODES AND ALSO IN MY MEDIA-STERNUM FROM THE LAST BIOPSY. THE DOCTORS ARE NOW SAYING THIS HAS BEEN LEAKING INTO SYSTEM SLOWLY SINCE BEFORE 2004 AND MY AUTOIMMUNE SYSTEM HAS BEEN FIGHTING, WHICH IS WHY I HAVE BEEN SO SICK. WELL, THE 1ST SURGERY WAS ON (B)(6) 2007. THE INCISIONS ARE ABOUT 3IN ON BOTH SIDE OF MY PELVIC AREA. THIS SURGERY WILL BE DIVIDING THE INFERIOR EPIGASTRIC BLOOD VESSELS, TRAINING THE TRAM TISSUES TO RELY ON THE SUPERIOR EPIGASTRIC SYSTEM. THIS STEP IS NOT REQUIRED FOR SUCCESSFUL PEDICLE TRAM RECONSTRUCTION BUT CAN IMPROVE BLOOD SUPPLY TO THE FLAP. SO-CALLED DELAY PROCEDURES MAY EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY OF PERFORMING MICROSURGERY (""SUPERCHARGING"") IF THE PEDICLE FLAP HAS ANY ARTERIAL OR VENOUS INSUFFICIENCY PROBLEMS, SINCE THE VESSELS DIVIDED IN THE ""DELAY"" CANNOT BE USED. IT IS INFECTING MY LUNGS AND IMMUNE SYSTEM AND OTHER MAJOR ORGANS. IN ALL I HAD A MINIMUM OF 13 MAJOR SURGERIES WHICH INCLUDE MORE RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY AND WOUND CARE, DEVELOP NECROSIS FROM THE SURGERY, ALL THE SILICONE COULD NOT BE REMOVED. I HAD DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH AND THERE IS VERY LITTLE ABOUT MY CONDITION AND SILICONE ILLNESS. BOTH THE SURGEON AND PLASTIC SURGEON HAVE SAID THIS IS A VERY RARE CONDITION. ON (B)(6) 2007, BILATERAL PEDICLES TRAM FLAP WITH THE REMOVAL OF SILICONE IMPLANTS. BOTH IMPLANTS WERE RUPTURED AND BLEEDING OUT, MORE ON THE LEFT THEN ON THE RIGHT SIDE. BUT THE PLASTIC SURGEON -PS- SAID THESE HAVE BEEN LEAKING FOR A LONG TIME. THE PS CLEANED ALL THE AREA WHILE NOT TO DISTURB THE BLOOD VESSEL FOR THE TRAM FLAPS. THE PS USED THE SKIN OF THE BREASTS FROM WHERE HE REMOVED THE IMPLANTS AND TRANSPLANTED THE FLAPS BILATERALLY TO KEEP ME THE SAME SIZE AND SYMMETRICALLY. THE ABDOMEN REPAIR ""TUMMY TUCK"". THERE HAS BEEN SOME BRUISING AROUND THE ""NEW PLACEMENT"" OF THE BELLY BUTTON AND ABDOMEN AROUND THERE. THE PS USED MESH FOR MY ABDOMEN INSTEAD OF ALLODERM, BECAUSE THE MESH WAS STRONGER. I CAN FEEL THAT MESH WHEN I WALK. I WAS IN SURGERY FOR 8 1/2 HOURS AND SUFFERED RESPIRATORY FAILURE WITH PULMONARY EDEMA WITHIN THE FIRST 24 HOURS. I WAS MOVED TO THE FLOOR AND DEVELOPED PNEUMONIA IN THE RIGHT LOWER LOBE. I SWEAR, I WAS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT BASED ON BREATHING. ANTIBIOTICS PUSH AND LASIX PUSH AND PLENTY OF RESPIRATORY THERAPY, WHEN I GOT HOME I HAD EXTRA EQUIPMENT OXYGEN, WALKER, AND HOSPITAL BED. I WAS ON A LOT OF ANTIBIOTICS AND PAIN PILLS. I WENT TO THE DOCTOR AND IT LOOKS LIKE I'M GOING TO BE ADMITTED BACK INTO THE HOSPITAL ON (B)(6) 2008 FOR MORE SURGERY FOR A WOUND THAT DEVELOPED IN THE ABDOMEN. THE SURGERY IS FOR DEBRIDEMENT OF THE WOUND THAT IS NOT HEALING AND PLACING A WOUND VAC ON IT. THE DOCTOR WILL HAVE TO REDO 8 INCHES OF THE INCISION. I WILL BE IN THE HOSPITAL FOR 2-3 DAYS; I WILL HAVE TO PRAY MORE. THE SURGERY IS SUPPOSED TO TAKE 1 TO 1 1/2 HOUR; WITH THE COMPLICATIONS OF MY LUNGS THAT TIME SHOULDN'T BE TOO BAD. I WAS AFRAID OF DEVELOPING INFECTION, (B)(6). THEN 6 WEEKS OF THE WOUND VAC ON MY ABDOMEN. I DID DEVELOP (B)(6) AND WAS HOSPITALIZE FOR 4 MONTHS IN 2008. I HAVE STARTED TO SEE THE TRANSPLANTATION TEAM TO HAVE A POSSIBLE LUNG REMOVED BEFORE I RUN OUT OF TIME. BOTH LUNGS ARE FILLED WITH SILICONE, AS WELL AS MY KIDNEYS, AND MY GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT. MY PULMONARY DOCTOR I HAVE HAS BEEN WITH ME FOR 4 YEARS, AND SHE HAS SEEN ME GET WORSE THROUGH ON-GOING TESTS AND YEARS. WITH THE LUNG BIOPSIES (B)(6) 2011, SHOWING SILICONE THROUGHOUT MY LUNGS, SHE THEN SAW MY LAST PFTS AND IT WAS WORSE BY 80% SINCE (B)(6) 2011, AND MY O2 LEVEL IS AT 7 LITERS NOW. IT HAS GONE UP BY 3 LITERS SINCE (B)(6) 2010. SO CURRENTLY, I AM GOING THROUGH THE PRE-TESTING FOR LUNG TRANSPLANTS TO SEE IF I QUALIFY FOR THE TRANSPLANTS. SO I HAVE TO GO THROUGH A LOT OF TESTING TO SEE IF MY BODY CAN HANDLE THE TRANSPLANTS. ONLY MY DOCTOR UNDERSTANDS EVERYTHING ABOUT WHAT IMPLANTS CAN DO TO YOU. SHE HAS SEEN ME GO THROUGH IT A LOT. WHEN MY IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED IN 2007, THE DOCTOR HAD TO LEAVE THE OUTER PART IN BECAUSE MY TISSUE WAS ALREADY TAKEN OVER. MY IMPLANTS HAD BEEN LEAKING UP TO 7 YEARS PER THE TIMELINE OF ALL THE ISSUE WITH MY HEALTH PER MY DOCTORS. I HOPE THE LUNG TRANSPLANTS WILL BE APPROVE TO PLACE ME ON THE ORGAN TRANSPLANT LIST. SILICONE IMPLANTS SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL MORE AND NEW UPDATED RESEARCH IS DONE.

SURGERY WAS UNEVENTFUL, I HAD HUGE SWELLING UPPER LEFT BREAST AREA POST SURGERY. I WAS DISCHARGED THE NEXT DAY WITH 2 BREAST DRAINS AND INSTRUCTED TO FOLLOW-UP WITH SURGEON. I FOLLOWED UP WITH MY PLASTIC SURGEON AT LEAST TWICE A WEEK. BREAST SURGERY WAS VERY PAINFUL. ON THIRD WEEK POST-SURGERY, I HAD SEVERAL MEDICAL COMPLAINTS: HEADACHE, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, NUMBNESS OF FACE, AND EVENTUALLY MOTTLING, REDNESS AND SWELLING OF LEFT BREAST, SWELLING ON PORT BELOW INTRA-MAMMARY FOLD. I HAD SEVERAL VISITS TO URGENT CARE, EMERGENCY HOSPITAL, AND DOCTORS' OFFICES. I DEVELOPED FEVER AND CELLULITIS ON BREAST; WHICH FELT LIKE A BALLOON. I WENT TO URGENT CARE ON (B)(6) 2012; WAS GIVEN VANCOMYCIN IV. THE NEXT DAY, I FELT THAT THE LEFT BREAST DEFLATED AND AREA AROUND PORT (INTRA-MAMMARY FOLD) FILLED WITH MORE FLUID. I SAW MY SURGEON WHO ORDERED ADMISSION TO HOSPITAL FOR SURGICAL EXPLANTATION, IRRIGATION, AND DEBRIDEMENT. SURGERY WAS PERFORMED ON THE NEXT DAY, (B)(6) 2012. CLOUDY SEROMA AND GRANULATION TISSUE WAS EVACUATED AND SALINE BREAST EXPANDER AND PORT WAS REMOVED. SAMPLES OF FLUID AND TISSUE WERE SUBMITTED FOR CULTURE AND SENSITIVITY TESTING, BUT NO HISTOPATHOLOGICAL SAMPLES WERE TAKEN. SHE SAID THAT THE IMPLANT WILL BE SUBMITTED FOR EXAMINATION AND THEN RETURNED TO MFR. I WAS GIVEN CONTINUOUS VANCOMYCIN TREATMENT FOR 2 DAYS AND WAS PRESCRIBED CIPRO AND ORAL PAIN MEDS. I HAD FOLLOW-UP VISITS AT HER OFFICE AND 2 DRAIN TUBES WERE REMOVED AFTER SEVERAL DAYS. THE INITIAL CULTURE TEST RESULTS AT (B)(6) CAME OUT AS ACID-FAST BACILLI, A FAST GROWER. I SAW AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR FOR EMPIRICAL TREATMENT WHILE WAITING FOR SENSITIVITY TESTING RESULTS. I STARTED WITH A COMBINATION TREATMENT OF CLARITHROMYCIN AND DOXYCYCLINE. THE TREATMENT WAS CONCURRED BY MY CURRENT INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR AT (B)(6) HOSPITAL. THE SAMPLE WAS SENT TO (B)(6) FOR FURTHER IDENTIFICATION AND SENSITIVITY TESTING. RESULTS OF THE TEST IDENTIFIED AS M. FORTUITUM, SENSITIVE TO CLARITHROMYCIN, BUT RESISTANT TO DOXYCYCLINE. MY INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR, REPLACED THE DOXYCYCLINE TO CIPRO IN COMBINATION WITH CLARITHROMYCIN. I FINALLY CONSULTED WITH (B)(6); WELL KNOWN EXPERTS IN DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF MYCOBACTERIAL INFECTIONS. I WANTED TO GET A ""DEFINITE REGARDING CAUSE"" OF PERSISTENT FIBRINOUS NODULAR TISSUE ON MY LEFT BREAST AND AXILLA. I FINALLY SAW AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR, WHO THEN PRESENTED MY CASE FOR REVIEW AT THEIR DEPARTMENT STAFF MEETING. ASSESSMENT WAS POSSIBLE MYCOBACTERIUM FORTUITUM IATROGENIC HEALTH CARE ASSOCIATED INFECTION OF THE LEFT BREAST IMPLANT. BECAUSE OF ABSENCE OF PERI-OPERATIVE PATHOLOGY TO LOOK FOR GRANULOMAS, NOR ABILITY TO RE-CULTURE THE SITE, PLAN WAS TO GET MRI OF RESIDUAL BREAST TISSUE AND CONSULT WITH SURGEON WHO SPECIALIZED IN MYCOBACTERIAL INFECTIONS. MRI RESULTS: SOME ABNORMAL FINDINGS, BUT COULD NOT RULE OUT IF THIS IS DUE TO INFECTIOUS DISEASE OR POST-SURGICAL CHANGES. I SAW A SURGEON AT (B)(6). SHE CONCURRED WITH (B)(6) TREATMENT OF 6 MONTHS ANTIBIOTICS AND RETURN APPOINTMENT FOR REASSESSMENT IN 3 MONTHS. ANTIBIOTIC COMBINATION WERE PRESCRIBED, CHANGED FROM TIME TO TIME TO PREVENT BACTERIAL RESISTANCE AND SIDE EFFECTS. ON THE LAST FEW WEEKS OF TREATMENT, I WAS SWITCHED TO TAKING SULFISOXAZOLE/TRIMETHOPRIM ALONE BECAUSE I WAS NOT ABLE TO TOLERATE THE SIDE EFFECTS FROM AVELOX, CIPRO, ETC. ON (B)(6) 2012, I HAD A RETURN DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT AND MRI AND BLOOD TEST AT (B)(6). SURGEON'S ASSESSMENT WAS THAT I HAVE NO APPARENT LESION OF MYCOBACTERIAL DISEASE. MY INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR WITHDREW ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT ON (B)(6). I STARTED HAVING STOMACH PAINS RIGHT AFTER I WITHDREW MY ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT. THE PAIN CONTINUED AND SPREAD ON THE ABDOMEN SPECIALLY ON THE LEFT LOWER QUADRANT. MY OBGYN DOCTOR PERFORMED ENDOMETRIAL BIOPSY WHICH RESULT WAS NEGATIVE. MY GASTROENTEROLOGIST ALSO PERFORMED COLONOSCOPY LAST WEEK AND AWAITING FOR RESULTS OF THE BIOPSY. HE SUGGESTED BREATH TEST TO RULE OUT SIBO. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF I GET AN IMPROVEMENT FROM THE COLON CLEANSING BEFORE I SCHEDULE TESTING.

THE PT WAS RE-IMPLANTED AT THAT TIME WITH MENTOR SALINE-FILLED MAMMARY PROSTHESES. SHE HAS ALSO PRESENTED WITH A RIGHT DEFLATION. SINCE REMOVING THESE DEVICES, THE PT'S SYMPTOMS HAVE SUBSIDED AND THE PT CAN WALK. BECAUSE THE LEFT PROSTHESIS INVOLVED IN THIS COMPLAINT WILL NOT BE RETURNED TO MENTOR, PE WAS PRECLUDED FROM EVALUATING THE DEVICE. BASED ON THE LABORATORY EVAL, PE CONCLUDED THE RIGHT DEFLATION WAS MOST LIKELY DUE TO THE RENT THAT MEASURED APPROX .1 CM IN LENGTH, WITHIN THE CREASE, ON THE POSTERIOR ASPECT OF THE DEVICE. A MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION OF THE EDGES OF THE RENT REVEALED A TAPERED WEAR PATTERN. TAPER WEAR IS CHARACTERISTIC OF A CREASE/FOLD FAILURE. A CREASE/FOLD FAILURE IS A KNOWN INHERENT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF SALINE-FILLED MAMMARY PROSTHESES AND MAY BE THE RESULT OF ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: UNDERINFLATION OR OVERINFLATION OF THE DEVICE, CONTINUOUS AND SUSTAINED STRESSES TO THE DEVICE - SUCH AS CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR TOO SMALL A BREAST POCKET, AND FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE SHELL IN THE BREAST POCKET. LEAK TESTING OF THE DEVICE REVEALED NO OTHER LEAKAGE SITES.

THE EXPANDERS WERE REMOVED AND NATRELLE SILICONE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANTS (STYLE 20) WERE PLACED ON (B)(6) 2009. THE LEFT BREAST IS 500CC REF 20-500 SN (B)(4) AND THE RIGHT BREAST IS 500CC REF 20-500 SN (B)(4). IN (B)(6) 2012, I BEGAN EXPERIENCING SEVERE NAUSEA, VOMITING, CONSTIPATION, AND WEIGHT LOSS (DROPPED NEARLY 40 POUNDS IN TWO MONTHS). I SAW MY PCP AND THEY DID EXTENSIVE TESTING AND DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING. A TUMOR WAS FOUND IN THE HYSTERECTOMY BED (HISTORY OF CANCER AND COMPLETE HYSTERECTOMY AND LEFT SALPINGO OOPHORECTOMY IN (B)(6) 2005 AND SUBSEQUENT RIGHT SALPINGO OOPHORECTOMY IN (B)(6) 2010). SURGERY REVEALED LARGE BENIGN TUMOR. THE GI PROBLEMS WERE REMOVED AND I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ESOPHAGITIS AND GASTRITIS. A YEAR LATER, (B)(6) 2014, I BEGAN HAVING JOINT PAIN THAT WOULD NOT GO AWAY DESPITE OTC NSAIDS. IN (B)(6), I SAW MY PCP WHO REFERRED ME TO A RHEUMATOLOGIST. I SAW THE RHEUMATOLOGIST AND WAS DIAGNOSED ON (B)(6) 2014, WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. SINCE THEN, I HAVE TAKEN IMURAN, ENBREL, PREDNISONE, LYRICA, AND VIMOVO. NONE OF THE MEDICATIONS HAVE PROVIDED REPRIEVE FROM MY SYMPTOMS. I BEGAN TO BECOME SKEPTICAL OF THE RA DIAGNOSIS, SO I BEGAN RESEARCHING MY MEDICAL RECORDS AND FOUND A DISCLAIMER IN THE SURGICAL CONSENT FORMS FOR THE SILICONE IMPLANTS THAT THERE MAY BE A LINK BETWEEN SILICONE IMPLANTS AND AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES SUCH AS SLE, RA, SCLERODERMA, AND OTHER ARTHRITIS-LIKE CONDITIONS. SINCE 2012, I HAVE EXPERIENCED AND CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE TO A GREATER DEGREE ALL THE SYMPTOMS NOTED: SWELLING AND/OR JOINT PAIN OR ARTHRITIS-LIKE PAIN, GENERAL ACHING, UNUSUAL HAIR LOSS, UNEXPLAINED OR UNUSUAL LOSS OF ENERGY, MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO COLDS, FLU, ETC., SWOLLEN GLANDS AND LYMPH NODES, RASH (ON FACE THAT HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED AS SEBORRHEIC DERMATITIS SUGGESTIVE OF AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE), SEVERE MEMORY PROBLEMS, HEADACHES, MUSCLE WEAKNESS OR BURNING, NAUSEA, VOMITING, IBS, AND FEVER. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IS MERELY COINCIDENTAL AS I NEVER HAD PROBLEMS LIKE THIS PRIOR TO THE MASTECTOMY AND RECONSTRUCTION. THEREFORE, I CONCLUDE THAT THE SILICONE EXPANDERS AND IMPLANTS ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO MY SYMPTOMS AND CONDITION. POSSIBLY, OTHER VARIABLES COULD CONTRIBUTE SUCH AS GENETIC PREDISPOSITION AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. HOWEVER, IN MY CASE THERE IS ENOUGH MEDICAL DATA TO INDICATE A CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SILICONE EXPANDERS AND IMPLANTS TO MY AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE AND SYMPTOMS. I HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE REASON I HAVE NOT RESPONDED TO NSAIDS (OTC AND RX), DMARDS, AND BIOLOGICS IS BECAUSE THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM IS THE SILICONE IMPLANTS. I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITH MY RHEUMATOLOGIST ON (B)(6) AND WILL REPORT MY FINDINGS TO HIM. MAY I REQUEST THAT A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FDA FOLLOW-UP WITH ME REGARDING MY REPORT?

I SAW THE RHEUMATOLOGIST AND WAS DIAGNOSED ON (B)(6) 2014, WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. SINCE THEN, I HAVE TAKEN IMURAN, ENBREL, PREDNISONE, LYRICA, AND VIMOVO. NONE OF THE MEDICATIONS HAVE PROVIDED REPRIEVE FROM MY SYMPTOMS. I BEGAN TO BECOME SKEPTICAL OF THE RA DIAGNOSIS, SO I BEGAN RESEARCHING MY MEDICAL RECORDS AND FOUND A DISCLAIMER IN THE SURGICAL CONSENT FORMS FOR THE SILICONE IMPLANTS THAT THERE MAY BE A LINK BETWEEN SILICONE IMPLANTS AND AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES SUCH AS SLE, RA, SCLERODERMA, AND OTHER ARTHRITIS-LIKE CONDITIONS. SINCE 2012, I HAVE EXPERIENCED AND CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE TO A GREATER DEGREE ALL THE SYMPTOMS NOTED: SWELLING AND/OR JOINT PAIN OR ARTHRITIS-LIKE PAIN, GENERAL ACHING, UNUSUAL HAIR LOSS, UNEXPLAINED OR UNUSUAL LOSS OF ENERGY, MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO COLDS, FLU, ETC., SWOLLEN GLANDS AND LYMPH NODES, RASH (ON FACE THAT HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED AS SEBORRHEIC DERMATITIS SUGGESTIVE OF AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE), SEVERE MEMORY PROBLEMS, HEADACHES, MUSCLE WEAKNESS OR BURNING, NAUSEA, VOMITING, IBS, AND FEVER. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IS MERELY COINCIDENTAL AS I NEVER HAD PROBLEMS LIKE THIS PRIOR TO THE MASTECTOMY AND RECONSTRUCTION. THEREFORE, I CONCLUDE THAT THE SILICONE EXPANDERS AND IMPLANTS ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO MY SYMPTOMS AND CONDITION. POSSIBLY, OTHER VARIABLES COULD CONTRIBUTE SUCH AS GENETIC PREDISPOSITION AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. HOWEVER, IN MY CASE THERE IS ENOUGH MEDICAL DATA TO INDICATE A CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SILICONE EXPANDERS AND IMPLANTS TO MY AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE AND SYMPTOMS. I HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE REASON I HAVE NOT RESPONDED TO NSAIDS (OTC AND RX), DMARDS, AND BIOLOGICS IS BECAUSE THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM IS THE SILICONE IMPLANTS. I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITH MY RHEUMATOLOGIST ON (B)(6) AND WILL REPORT MY FINDINGS TO HIM. MAY I REQUEST THAT A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FDA FOLLOW-UP WITH ME REGARDING MY REPORT?

AN UPDATE TO OUR SAFETY DATABASE, FOR THIS REPORTED EVENT, NOTES THAT THE TERM CODE HAS BEEN CHANGED FROM CANCER TO LYMPHOMA-ALCL DUE TO INCREASED SPECIFICITY. PT IDENTIFIER (B)(6) RELATES TO PT'S RECORD PREVIOUSLY EXISTING IN (B)(4) DATABASE. CURRENT DATABASE PT IDENTIFIER (B)(6). DEVICE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDED: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES TO NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. CALCIUM DEPOSITS CAN FORM IN THE TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT WITH SYMPTOMS THAT MAY INCLUDE PAIN AND FIRMNESS. LYMPHADENOPATHY HAS ALSO BEN REPORTED IN SOME WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS. USE CARE IN SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURES SUCH AS OPEN CAPSULOTOMY, BREAST POCKET REVISION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA ASPIRATION, AND BIOPSY/LUMPECTOMY TO AVOID DAMAGE TO THE IMPLANT. PT SHOULD PERFORM BREAST SELF-EXAMINATIONS MONTHLY AND BE SHOWN HOW TO DISTINGUISH THE IMPLANT FROM THEIR BREAST TISSUE. THE PT SHOULD NOT MANIPULATE OR SQUEEZE THE EXCESSIVELY. THE PT SHOULD BE TOLD THAT THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGE IN THE IMPLANT SHAPE MAY BE SIGNS OF SYMPTOMATIC RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. IF THE PT HAS ANY OF THESE SIGNS, SHE SHOULD BE TOLD TO REPORT THEM, AND POSSIBLY HAVE AN MRI EVAL TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. THE NATRELLE CORE STUDY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE LONG-TERM (10 YEARS) SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PROD. IN ADDITION, ALLERGAN HAS INITIATED A SEPARATE LARGE 10-YEAR POSTAPPROVAL STUDY (BREAST IMPLANT F/U STUDIES, OR BIFS) TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC ISSUES WHICH ALLERGAN'S CORE STUDY WAS NOT DESIGNED TO FULLY ANSWER, AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE A REAL-WORLD ASSESSMENT OF SOME ENDPOINTS. THE ENDPOINTS IN THE BIFS LARGE POSTAPPROVAL STUDY INCLUDE LONG-TERM LOCAL COMPLICATIONS, CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE (CTD), CTD SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS, NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE, NEUROLOGICAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS, OFFSPRING ISSUES, REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES, CANCER SUICIDE, MAMMOGRAPHY ISSUES, AND MRI COMPLIANCE AND RESULTS. ALLERGAN WILL UPDATE THEIR LABELING ON A REGULAR BASIS WITH THE RESULTS OF THESE TWO STUDIES. THERE WAS 1 PRIMARY AUGMENTATION PT WITH A NEW DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER THROUGH 7 YEARS IN THE CORE STUDY. THERE WAS A 13% BENIGN BREAST DISEASE RATE AND 1% MALIGNANT BREAST DISEASE RATE. FOR REVISION-AUGMENTATION PTS, THERE WAS 1 PT WITH A NEW DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER. THER WAS A 15% BENIGN BREAST DISEASE RATE AND A 1% MALIGNANT BREAST DISEASE RATE THROUGH 7 YEARS. IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION PTS THERE WAS 1 REPORT OF THYROID CANCER AND 1 REPORT OF BRAIN CANCER. THERE WERE NO REPORTS OF OTHER CANCERS, SUCH AS RESPIRATORY OR CERVICAL/VULVAR, IN REVISION-AUGMENTATION PTS. THERE WERE 8 PRIMARY RECONSTRUCTION PTS (8%) WITH NEW REPORTS OF BREAST CANCER THROUGH 7 YEARS IN THE CORE STUDY. THERE WAS A 17% BENIGN BREAST DISEASE RATE AND A 10% MALIGNANT BREAST DISEASE RATE THROUGH 7 YEARS. FOR REVISION RECONSTRUCTION PTS, THERE WERE NO REPORTS OF NEW DIAGNOSES OR REOCCURRENCE OF BREAST CANCER. THERE WAS A 7% BENIGN BREAST DISEASE RATE THROUGH 7 YEARS.

5155756|28464643|N|0||DEVICE LABELING: PUBLISHED STUDIES INDICATE THAT BREAST CANCER IS NO MORE COMMON IN WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS THAN THOSE WITHOUT IMPLANTS. A LARGE, LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP FOUND NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE RISK RATES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CANCERS, INCLUDING STOMACH CANCER, LEUKEMIA, AND LYMPHOMA. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, ASYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. DEFLATION Â¿ BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS DEFLATE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. DEFLATION CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO DEFLATE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS; FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL; EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED); TRAUMA; COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING; AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF DEFLATION FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT; HOWEVER, IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF DEFLATION.|STYLE 168 SALINE FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|168-420|10/16/2015||||N|R||0HP|FWM|1.0|05/01/1996|PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||2-163072|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

5222818|31178939|N|1||(B)(4). DEVICE LABELING: BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. IN THE PASS STUDY, AT LEAST 1 REOPERATION WAS PERFORMED ON 315 PATIENTS (36.5%) THROUGH 10 YEARS. A TOTAL OF 424 REOPERATIONS WERE PERFORMED. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR REOPERATION THROUGH 10 YEARS ON AUGMENTATION PATIENTS WAS IMPLANT DEFLATION AT 21.7%. THE PERCENTAGE OF REOPERATIONS DUE TO LUMP/MASS/CYST INCREASED FROM 8.5% OF 293 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 5 YEARS TO 13.9% OF 424 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 10 YEARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF LUMPS, MASSES, AND CYSTS CAN BE EXPECTED TO NATURALLY INCREASE AS PATIENTS AGE AND COULD BE AN EXPLANATION FOR THE INCREASE. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, ASYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. OF THE 237 PATIENTS IN THE R95 STUDY, AT LEAST 1 REOPERATION WAS PERFORMED ON 99 PATIENTS (42%) FOR A TOTAL OF 125 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 5 YEARS. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR REOPERATION THROUGH 5 YEARS WAS CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE AT 25.6%. OF THE 237 RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS IN R95, THERE WERE 62 PATIENTS (26.2%) WHO HAD 70 IMPLANTS REMOVED THROUGH 5 YEARS. OF THE 70 RECONSTRUCTION IMPLANTS REMOVED THROUGH 5 YEARS, 70% WERE REPLACED. THE MOST COMMON REASON FOR IMPLANT REMOVAL WAS CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE (31.4%). THROUGH 10 YEARS, THERE WERE 104 IMPLANTS REMOVED FROM 85 PATIENTS. THE MOST COMMON REASON FOR IMPLANT REMOVAL WAS IMPLANT LEAKAGE/DEFLATION (32.7%).|STYLE 363 SALINE FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|363LF-410|11/13/2015||||N|R||0HP|FWM|1.0|10/09/2005|PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||569053|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

AN UPDATE TO OUR SAFETY DATABASE FOR THIS REPORTED EVENT NOTES THAT THE TERM CODE HAS BEEN CHANGED FROM CANCER TO LYMPHOMA-ALCL DUE TO INCREASED SPECIFICITY. SEROMA WAS REPORTED AT THAT TIME ALSO. DEVICE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. CALCIUM DEPOSITS CAN FORM IN THE TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT WITH SYMPTOMS THAT MAY INCLUDE PAIN AND FIRMNESS. LYMPHADENOPATHY HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED IN SOME WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS. BASED ON INFO REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGAN'S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERS' BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MUFTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. USE CARE IN SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURES SUCH AS OPEN CAPSULOTOMY, BREAST POCKET REVISION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA ASPIRATION, AND BIOPSY/LUMPECTOMY TO AVOID DAMAGE TO THE IMPLANT SHELL OR VALVE. ANY POSTOPERATIVE EVACUATION OF HEMATOMA OR SEROMA MUST BE CONDUCTED WITH CARE TO AVOID BREAST IMPLANT CONTAMINATION, OR DAMAGE FROM SHARP INSTRUMENTS. THE USE OF MICROWAVE DIATHERMY IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST IMPLANTS IS NOT RECOMMENDED, AS IT HAS BEEN REPORTED TO CAUSE TISSUE NECROSIS, SKIN EROSION, AND EXTRUSION OF THE IMPLANT. ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE IN VIVO EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. PATIENTS SHOULD BE INFORMED THAT DISSATISFACTION WITH COSMETIC RESULTS RELATED TO SUCH THINGS AS SCAR DEFORMITY, HYPERTROPHIC SCARRING, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, INCORRECT SIZE, AND IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY MAY OCCUR. CAREFUL SURGICAL PLANNING AND TECHNIQUE CAN MINIMIZE, BUT NOT PRECLUDE, THE RISK OF SUCH RESULTS. PRE-EXISTING ASYMMETRY MAY NOT BE ENTIRELY CORRECTABLE. REVISION SURGERY MAY BE INDICATED TO MAINTAIN PATIENT SATISFACTION BUT CARRIES ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS AND RISKS.

THE NATRELLE CORE STUDY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE LONG-TERM (10 YEARS) SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, ALLERGAN HAS INITIATED A SEPARATE LARGE 10-YEAR POST-APPROVAL STUDY (THE BREAST IMPLANT FOLLOW-UP STUDIES, OR BIFS) TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC ISSUES WHICH ALLERGAN'S CORE STUDY WAS NOT DESIGNED TO FULLY ANSWER, AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE A REAL-WORLD ASSESSMENT OF SOME ENDPOINTS. THE ENDPOINTS IN THE BIFS LARGE POST-APPROVAL STUDY INCLUDE LONG-TERM LOCAL COMPLICATIONS, CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE (CTD), CTD SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS, NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE, NEUROLOGICAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS, OFFSPRING ISSUES, REPRODUCTIVE ISSUES, LACTATION ISSUES, CANCER, SUICIDE, MAMMOGRAPHY ISSUES, AND MRI COMPLIANCE AND RESULTS. ALLERGAN WILL UPDATE THEIR LABELING ON A REGULAR BASIS WITH THE RESULTS OF THESE TWO STUDIES. THERE WAS 1 PRIMARY AUGMENTATION PATIENT WITH A NEW DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER THROUGH 7 YEARS IN THE CORE STUDY. THERE WAS A 13% BENIGN BREAST DISEASE RATE AND A 1% MALIGNANT BREAST DISEASE RATE.

5277099|33181451|D|1||HAD A BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY IN (B)(6) 2015. IT WAS TO REPLACE MY OLDER IMPLANTS IN WHICH I HAD NO PROBLEMS. THIS WAS JUST A ROUTINE BREAST REVISION SURGERY. THE IMPLANTS WERE MADE BY SIENTRA. AT 2 WEEKS AFTER SURGERY GOT VERY ILL, DIZZINESS, FEVER, CHILLS, EXTREME FATIGUES, LOSS OF APPETITE, AND PAIN ON MY LEFT SIDE. IT WENT UNDIAGNOSED FOR ANOTHER WEEK, THEY THOUGHT I HAD CONTRACTED THE FLU. THE PLASTIC SURGEON REFERRED ME TO AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE DR. EXACTLY ONE MONTH AFTER SURGERY, I STARTED IV ANTIBIOTICS UNDER CARE OF. BEGUN A 4 WEEK ROUND OF VANCOMYCIN AND AZITHROMYCIN. INFECTION LEVELS DROPPED SOME, STILL VERY ILL AND SKIN ON BREAST WAS REDDER, MORE HARD, AND VERY PAINFUL. AT WEEK 8, NOTICED SOME DISCHARGE FROM NIPPLE WHERE THE STITCHES HAD BEEN. I WENT TO PLASTIC SURGEON, HE MADE A SMALL HOLE, FLUID CAME GUSHING OUT. HE SAID THE IMPLANT WAS ON TOP AND WAS VISIBLE, RATHER THAN UNDER THE MUSCLE; IT WAS PUSHING ITS' WAY OUT. SCHEDULED THE SURGERY OF EXPLANT OF THE LEFT SIDE IN WHICH I HAD THE INFECTION. MY RIGHT BREST APPEARED FINE, NO PAIN OR REDNESS, STITCHES NORMAL ON THE RIGHT SIDE. IN DOING A CULTURE OF THE TISSUE, IT WAS DETERMINED THE INFECTION WAS CAUSED BY MYCOBACTERIUM FORTUITUM. WHEN THE INFECTIOUS DISEASE DR. INFORMED ME OF WHAT THIS WAS, HE SAID IT WAS VERY RARE IN THE US. HE HAD ONLY SEEN THIS INFECTION ONCE BEFORE, 10 YRS. PRIOR ON A BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY ON SOMEONE WHO HAD BEEN IN THE MARINES. I THEN STARTED THE ANTIBIOTIC CLARITHROMYCIN FOR ANOTHER 4 WEEKS. THE DR. HAS FELT THAT A PROTOCOL SOMEWHERE WAS MISSED AND BELIEVED WAS ON THE IMPLANT TO START. IN GATHERING SECOND OPINIONS, AS I WAS CONCERNED, GOING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL SURGEON, NUMEROUS COMMENTS FROM PLASTIC SURGEONS WERE THEY ASSUMED I HAD GONE OUT OF THE COUNTRY TO HAVE MY SURGERY. I HAVE NEVER BEEN OUT OF THE COUNTRY AND HAD SURGERY IN (B)(6). I CONTACTED THE COUNTY HEALTH DEPT., BUT THEY DON'T KEEP RECORD OR REPORT THIS TYPE OF BACTERIA I WAS TOLD. CURRENTLY HAVE DISFIGURED LEFT SIDE DUE TO LOTS OF TISSUE DAMAGE AND LOTS OF SCAR TISSUE. SIENTRA - LEFT SIDE (INFECTED SIDE) (B)(4), SERIAL #(B)(4) SMOOTH ROUND, MP ON (B)(6), WAS AT A PLASTIC SURGEONS OFFICE FOR A CONSULTATION. HE MENTIONED HE HOPED THAT SIENTRA IMPLANTS WOULD BE BACK AVAILABLE IN THE SPRING OF 2016 TO HIS NURSE. THIS MADE ME CURIOUS AS I HAD NOT HEARD THEY WERE OFF MARKET. SAW AN ARTICLE FROM (B)(6) 2015, THAT THERE WERE SOME PROBLEMS WITH PLANT IN (B)(6). I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO REPORT SINCE THE INFECTION MAY HAVE COME FROM THIS PLANT; WOULD NOT WANT PEOPLE TO GO THROUGH THE LAST FEW MONTHS OF WHAT I DID AND THE RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY YET TO COME. I HAVE ASKED THE ORIGINAL DOCTOR A FEW TIMES IF HE REPORTS TO SIENTRA THE LOT NUMBER AS I WAS CURIOUS IF ANYONE ELSE EXPERIENCED THESE PROBLEMS, HE SAID NO, AS IF IT WASN'T SOMETHING TO REPORT TO THEM. I WENT ONLINE TO THE SIENTRA WEBSITE IN (B)(6) TO SEE IF THEY SPOKE OF ANY PROBLEMS AND THERE WASN'T A RECALL OR FURTHER INFO.|SIENTRA BREAST IMPLANT||12/06/2015||||*|*||I|FTR|1.0||BRAST IMPLANT|||||||SIENTRA|||||10512-550-MP||True

THE ABSTRACT OF THIS ARTICLE WAS FIRST RECEIVED ON 11/09/2016. THIS EVENT WAS FIRST RECEIVED IN THE ABSTRACT. FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE AUTHOR REGARDING EVENT, PRODUCT, OR PATIENT DETAILS HAS BEEN REQUESTED. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. DEVICE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. BREAST IMPLANTS RUPTURE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. RUPTURES CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO RUPTURE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, STRESSING THE IMPLANT DURING IMPLANTATION AND WEAKENING IT, FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL, EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED), TRAUMA, COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING, AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF RUPTURE FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT. IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF RUPTURE. LABORATORY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RUPTURE ARE ONGOING. SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE. IF RUPTURE OCCURS, SILICONE GEL MAY EITHER REMAIN WITHIN THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), MOVE OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE (EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), OR MOVE OUTSIDE THE BREAST (GEL MIGRATION). THERE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY THAT RUPTURE MAY PROGRESS FROM INTRACAPSULAR TO EXTRACAPSULAR AND BEYOND."|STYLE 153 SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|UNK STYLE 153|12/02/2016||||N|R||0HP|FTR|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||NI|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

LEAK TEST WAS PERFORMED AND NOT FOUND LEAKAGE. A MICROSCOPIC ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED WHICH IDENTIFY DELAMINATION OF THE PLUG STRAP DISK SHELL. THE FILL TEST INSPECTION WAS PERFORMED, THE RESULT IS NO BLOCKAGE. BASED ON THE DEVICE ANALYSIS THE FINAL ASSESSMENT IS: DELAMINATION OF THE PLUG STRAP DISK SHELL ASSESSED AS ADHESIVE FAILURE. DEVICE HISTORY RECORD (DHR) DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY DEVIATIONS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS OR NON-CONFORMANCES DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS. THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT DEVICES FROM THIS WORK ORDER WERE ASSEMBLED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALLERGAN MEDICAL PROCEDURES AND SPECIFICATIONS. THE REPORTED DEVICE WAS INTACT AT THE TIME OF PRODUCTION AND MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. THE EVENTS OF LYMPHOMA-ALCL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, INFLAMMATION AND PAIN ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THESE EVENTS. REPORTED EVENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN DEVICE LABELING: ""LYMPHOMA, INCLUDING ANAPLASTIC LARGE T-CELL LYMPHOMA(ALCL) - INFORMATION FROM MEDICAL LITERATURE HAS SUGGESTED A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION, WITHOUT EVIDENCE OF CAUSATION, BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE VERY RARE OCCURRENCE OF ALCL IN THE BREAST. THE DISEASE IS EXCEPTIONALLY RARE, MAY PRESENT AS A LATE OCCURRING PERI-PROSTHETIC SEROMA, AND OCCURS IN WOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT BREAST IMPLANTS. SPECIFIC TESTING IS NEEDED TO DISTINGUISH ALCL FROM BREAST CANCER. THE MAJORITY OF REPORTED CASES HAD AN INDOLENT CLINICAL COURSE FOLLOWING CAPSULECTOMY WITH OR WITHOUT ADJUVANT THERAPY, WHICH IS GENERALLY UNCHARACTERISTIC OF SYSTEMIC ALCL. TREATMENT SHOULD BE DETERMINED IN CONSULTATION WITH A HEMATO-ONCOLOGIST."" ""FORMATION OF FIBROUS TISSUE AROUND AN IMPLANTED DEVICE IS A NORMAL PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE. FIBROUS CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE REMAINS A COMMON COMPLICATION FOLLOWING BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY AND IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. THE CAUSE OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS UNKNOWN, HOWEVER IT IS MOST LIKELY MULTIFACTORIAL AND MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HAEMATOMA, AND SEROMA. CONTRACTURE DEVELOPS TO VARYING DEGREES, UNILATERALLY OR BILATERALLY, AND MAY OCCUR WITHIN WEEKS TO YEARS AFTER SURGERY. CONTRACTURE OF THE FIBROUS CAPSULAR TISSUE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT MAY CAUSE A RANGE OF SYMPTOMS INCLUDING FIRMNESS, DISCOMFORT, PAIN, DISTORTION, PALPABILITY, AND/OR DISPLACEMENT. SEVERE CASES ARE CONSIDERED THE MOST CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT, AND MAY REQUIRE SURGICAL INTERVENTION. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY RECUR SUBSEQUENT TO CORRECTIVE SURGICAL PROCEDURES.

5801921|49945348|D|1||"I HAD BREAST AUGMENTATION IN 1998 BY A (B)(6) PLASTIC SURGEON. WITHIN 2 YEARS, I DEVELOPED HASHIMOTO'S AUTOIMMUNE THYROIDITIS. OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, I DEVELOPED CHRONIC FATIGUE, CHRONIC EPSTEIN-BARR, RECURRENT LOW GRADE FEVER, SWOLLEN LYMPH NODES, BRAIN FOG, SKIN NODULES, CHRONIC SINUS INFECTIONS. I WENT FROM DOCTOR TO DOCTOR ABOUT DIFFERENT ISSUES WITHOUT RECEIVING MUCH EXPLANATION FOR MY SYMPTOMS. IN 2012, ONE OF MY SALINE IMPLANTS RUPTURED. I WAS NOT IN A POSITION FINANCIALLY TO REPLACE THEM. I CONTACTED MY ORIGINAL PLASTIC SURGEON IN (B)(64). MY RECORDS HAD BEEN DESTROYED. HE MENTIONED TWO BRANDS OF IMPLANTS THAT HE WAS USING IN 1998. AFTER MY RUPTURE, I SLOWLY DEVELOPED MIGRAINES 1-3 DAYS A WEEK AND ARM AND HAND NUMBNESS. MY FATIGUE WORSENED. MY CONCENTRATION WAS BAD. A FEW MONTHS AFTER THE RUPTURE, I FOUND ONE OF MY ID CARDS, I WAS APPALLED TO FIND OUT THAT I HAD PIP BRAND TEXTURED SALINE IMPLANTS. THIS WAS NOT ONE OF THE BRANDS THAT MY SURGEON MENTIONED ON THE PHONE. THEN I FOUND OUT THAT THE FDA HAD DENIED THEIR APPROVAL IN 2000. I WAS NEVER NOTIFIED BY MY SURGEON OR THE FDA THAT MY IMPLANTS HAD BEEN DENIED APPROVAL. I HAD TO LEAVE MY RUPTURED IMPLANT IN FOR 3 YEARS BEFORE I COULD REMOVE THEM. DURING THAT TIME, I WAS CONSIDERING ALL OF MY OPTIONS. I FOUND A PLASTIC SURGEON IN DALLAS WHO DOES NOT PERFORM BREAST AUGMENTATION BECAUSE HE HAS SEEN SO MANY WOMEN WHO DEVELOPED ILLNESS FROM THEIR BREAST IMPLANTS. HIS LIST OF COMMON SYMPTOMS WENT RIGHT ALONG WITH MY LIST. I FINALLY REMOVED BOTH BREAST IMPLANTS IN (B)(6) 2015. MANY OF MY SYMPTOMS IMMEDIATELY DISAPPEARED. MY LOW GRADE FEVER, ARM AND HAND NUMBNESS, SWOLLEN LYMPH NODES, MIGRAINES, AND BRAIN FOG WENT AWAY IMMEDIATELY AFTER SURGERY. I STILL HAVE HASHIMOTO'S AND I STILL BATTLE FATIGUE. OVERALL, THOUGH, MY HEALTH IS GREATLY IMPROVED. I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT MY IMPLANTS CONTRIBUTED TO MY DECLINING HEALTH. I SENT MY IMPLANTS TO DR. (B)(6) FOR EVAL. THE TEXTURED SURFACE SHOWED MAJOR EROSION AND MY RUPTURED IMPLANT WAS FULL OF CONTAMINANTS. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE PROCESS OF ALLOWING THESE PIP IMPLANTS INTO THE US FOR USE, WHY THE FDA DENIED THEIR APPROVAL, THE REASON THAT I WAS NOT NOTIFIED, AND HOW I CAN OBTAIN THE CHEMICAL MAKEUP OF THESE SALINE PIP IMPLANTS. IT IS WIDELY KNOWN THAT THE SILICONE PIP IMPLANTS USED INTERNATIONALLY WERE MADE WITH INDUSTRIAL GRADE SILICONE AND THEY HAD A HIGH RATE OF RUPTURE. I HAVE MET THOUSANDS OF WOMEN WHO ARE IN THE SAME SITUATION AS ME. THEY TOO HAVE DEVELOPED AUTOIMMUNE ILLNESS AND STRANGE SYMPTOMS AFTER AUGMENTATION. I AM IN NUMEROUS SUPPORT GROUPS FOR THESE WOMEN. I SPEAK OUT PUBLICLY ABOUT IT AND I WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. WE HAVE AN UPCOMING (B)(6) CONFERENCE ON BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESS TO DISCUSS THIS VERY ISSUE. LONG-TERM STUDIES NEED TO BE DONE (15-20 YEAR STUDIES) AND THEY NEED TO BE FOUND BY SOMEONE OTHER THAN THE IMPLANT MFRS. I HAVE MET WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN SUSPICIOUSLY DROPPED FROM THE STUDIES THEY WERE IN. I HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING PUBLICATIONS, MEDICAL JOURNALS, RADIOLOGICAL JOURNALS, ETC., FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS. IT IS APPALLING TO READ SOME OF THESE ARTICLES AND STILL SEE THAT THE FDA LABELS THESE AS SAFE. THE MENTOR MEMORYGEL PHYSICIAN'S LABELING PAMPHLET THAT IS ON THE FDA WEBSITE STATES THAT THE STUDIES INVOLVING A RELATION TO CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDER NEEDS TO BE LARGER (NOT THAT THERE ISN'T A CONNECTION), THAT THE STUDIES INVOLVING NEUROLOGICAL SYMPTOMS ARE INSUFFICIENT OR FLAWED (NOT THAT THERE ISN'T A CONNECTION), AND THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN SYMPTOMS SUCH AS CHRONIC FATIGUE, JOINT PAIN, FIBROMYALGIA, ETC., EVEN WHEN THE IMPLANTS AREN'T DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO A ""DEFINED ILLNESS"". THIS IS THE PAMPHLET FROM THE IMPLANT MFR YET MANY WOMEN SAY THAT THEY WERE NEVER TOLD OF THESE POSSIBLE RISKS. THE SAME PAMPHLET SAYS THAT SILICONE AND PLATINUM CAN MIGRATE THROUGH THE SEMI-PERMEABLE INTACT SHELL YET WE CAN'T GET A LIST OF INGREDIENTS.

DEVICE LABELING: THERE HAVE BEEN CONCERNS RAISED REGARDING POTENTIAL DAMAGING EFFECTS ON CHILDREN BORN OF MOTHERS WITH IMPLANTS. A REVIEW OF THE PUBLISHED LITERATURE ON THIS ISSUE SUGGESTS THAT THE INFORMATION IS INSUFFICIENT TO DRAW DEFINITIVE CONCLUSIONS. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, A SYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER THESE ADDITIONAL SURGERIES. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF DEFLATION."|STYLE 68 SALINE FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|68-360|03/25/2016||||N|R||0HP|FWM|1.0|03/03/2012|PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||1578988|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

5649766|45202175|D|1||"I HAD BREAST IMPLANTS PUT IN BEHIND THE MUSCLE ON (B)(6) 2012. SHORTLY AFTER THE SURGERY, I BECAME ILL STARTING WITH FATIGUE AND HAIR LOSS. EACH YEAR SINCE, I HAVE HAD AN INCREASING AMOUNT OF SYMPTOMS BEGIN AND BASICALLY EACH ORGAN WITHIN MY BODY FELT AS THOUGH IT WAS FAILING AS MY SYMPTOMS WORSENED. I HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO SPECIALISTS IN VARIOUS DIFFERENT SPECIALITIES AS WELL AS HOLISTIC HEALERS AND NATUROPATHS TRYING TO FIND THE SOURCE OF MY SUDDEN ONSET OF ILLNESSES. PRIOR TO HAVING THE BREAST IMPLANTS, I WAS A HEALTHY MOTHER OF TWO AND HARDLY EVER MISSED WORK FOR ANYTHING BEYOND THE COMMON COLD. WITH ALL OF THE MEDICAL PROBLEMS, I WAS REQUIRED TO FILE (B)(6) WITH MY EMPLOYER OF SIX YEARS DUE TO THE NATURE OF MY SYMPTOMS AND THE AMOUNT OF WORK I MISSED FOR TREATMENTS AND NEW CONSULTATIONS WITH DOCTORS ON A CONSISTENT BASIS. I WAS FINALLY DIAGNOSED WITH COMMON VARIABLE IMMUNE DEFICIENCY AND BEGAN IVIG TREATMENTS EVERY OTHER WEEK TRYING TO PREVENT THE CONSTANT INFECTIONS I WAS GETTING REGULARLY AND I HOPED WAS THE SOURCE OF MY PROBLEMS. AFTER A YEAR OF THOSE TREATMENTS AND MORE REFERRALS TO DIFFERENT SPECIALISTS, I FOUND A GROUP OF WOMEN WHO ALL HAVE EVERY SYMPTOM THAT I HAD AND SOME EVEN MORE AND THEY HAVE BEEN LINKED TO THEIR BREAST IMPLANTS AND HAVE CALLED THE ILLNESS BII OR BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESS. AFTER HEARING THAT WOMEN WERE GETTING BETTER AFTER HAVING THEM REMOVED, I DECIDED TO EXPLANT ON (B)(6) 2016. SINCE THAT TIME, OVER HALF OF MY SYMPTOMS HAVE DISAPPEARED AND OTHERS ARE GOING AWAY EACH DAY. I AM ON LESS THAN OF HALF OF THE MEDICATIONS I HAD BEE TAKING SINCE IMPLANTING IN 2012 AND I FEEL OVER 50% BETTER THAN I DID WHILE THE IMPLANTS WERE IN MY BODY. I DO NOT KNOW FOR SURE IF THERE WAS MOLD OR FUNGUS PRESENT AS MOST COSMETIC SURGEONS WIL NOT TEST THEM AFTER TAKING THEM OUT AND DO NOT BELIEVE THAT BREAST IMPLANTS (ESPECIALLY SALINE) CAN MAKE WOMEN ILL. I HAVE RECENTLY FOUND OUT THE COMBINATION OF TOXIC MATERIALS USED TO MAKE THE SHELL OF SALINE IMPLANTS AND WAS NEVER GIVEN THAT LIST OF INGREDIENTS PRIOR TO IMPLANTING. MOST OF MY SYMPTOMS MIMIC THAT OF AN AUTOIMMUNE ILLNESS YET I WAS GIVEN NO DIAGNOSIS DUE TO ""NORMAL"" LAB WORK. I HAVE NEVER BEEN DIAGNOSED NOR HAD THE SYMPTOMS OF AUTOIMMUNE ILLNESS PRIOR TO IMPLANTING AND BELIEVE THE SALINE IMPLANTS HAVE MADE ME ILL AND TAKEN AWAY 4 YEARS OF MY LIFE. WOMEN SHOULD BE TOLD THE INGREDIENTS AND SURGEONS SHOULD NOT TELL US THAT SALINE OR SILICONE IMPLANTS ARE SAFE AFTER THE PROBLEMS WITH EARLIER IMPLANTS. I ALSO WAS NOT TESTED OR ASKED IF I HAD AN AUTOIMMUNE ILLNESSES PRIOR TO IMPLANTING. BOTH SALINE AND SILICONE IMPLANTS ARE MAKING WOMEN SICK AND IN SOME CASES LEADING TO DEATH. THEY WOULD NOT BE ADVERTISED AS SAFE AND FURTHER TESTING NEEDS TO BE DONE TO FIND OUT WHY THOUSANDS OF WOMEN ARE BECOMING ILL WITH THE SAME SYMPTOMS. I AM PROOF THAT BII EXISTS. HERE ARE MY LIST OF SYMPTOMS PRIOR TO EXPLANTING. THERE WERE SEVERAL MORE RIGHT BEFORE MY EXPLANT SURGERY BUT COULD NOT LIST THEM AS MY ""BRAIN FOG"" AND MEMORY ISSUES BECAME DEBILITATING. CHARLEY HORSES (RLS), IRRITABILITY, FOOD SENSITIVITIES, SWOLLEN HANDS/FEET, FREQUENT URINATION, FATIGUE, BRAIN FOG, MEMORY LOSS, DIFFICULTY GETTING TO SLEEP (FEEL LIKE I DIDN'T SLEEP), HAIR LOSS, HEADACHES, MUSCLE PAIN, MUSCLE WEAKNESS, CARPAL TUNNEL, VEIN ISSUES, HOT ALL THE TIME, TENDON ISSUES, VISION PROBLEMS, EPITHELIAL IN GROWTH, PANIC ATTACKS, EAR PAIN (HAVE TUBES), SKIN ISSUES, DELAYED HEALING, SORES (FACE, CHEST, BACK), NO SEX DRIVE, CRYING, SIDE EFFECTS TO MEDICATIONS, IMMUNE DEFICIENCY, FIBROMYALGIA, WEIGHT GAIN/LOSS, HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, BRUISING, OCD MOMENTS, INFLAMMATION, CANDIDA/YEAST INFECTIONS, THYROID CHANGES, LOSS OF APPETITE, NIGHT SWEATS, CONSTIPATION, VERTIGO (DIZZY), ANXIETY, PANIC ATTACKS. THERE IS CURRENTLY NO LAB, SCANS OR ANY OTHER DIAGNOSTIC TEST THAT CAN IDENTIFY BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESS. THERE ARE ALSO NO TESTS AVAILABLE TO TEST FOR MOLD, FUNGUS, BACTERIA OR ANY OF THE OTHER TOXIC INGREDIENTS IN THE IMPLANT MATERIALS IN A HUMAN BODY. IF THERE ARE ANY, MOST PHYSICIANS ARE NOT AWARE OF THEM OR BELIEVE THEY ARE INACCURATE. IF WOMEN FIND A PROVIDER OF TESTS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT IDENTIFY ANY OF THE INGREDIENTS LISTED ABOVE, WE HAVE TO PAY HUNDREDS TO THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO OBTAIN TESTS THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY RECOGNIZED BY THE MEDICAL FIELD.

THE DHR ASSEMBLY REPORT FROM SAP WAS VERIFIED AND THREE DEVICES WERE SCRAPPED DURING THE ASSEMBLY PROCESS WHICH ARE NOT RELATED TO THE REPORTED EVENT . IN ADDITION, DHR FOR SHELL RUNS NUMBER (B)(4) DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY DEVIATIONS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS OR NON-CONFORMANCES DURING SHELL FABRICATION PROCESS. ALL SHELLS WERE REVIEWED AS PART OF THE SHELL FABRICATION OPERATIONS AND THESE TASKS WERE PERFORMED ACCORDING TO APPLICABLE CURRENT PROCEDURES TO ENSURE THAT FABRICATION MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION GATHERED DURING THE DHR REVIEW, THERE IS ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT DEVICES FROM WORK ORDER (B)(4) WERE ASSEMBLED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALLERGAN MEDICAL PROCEDURES AND SPECIFICATIONS. THE REPORTED DEVICE WAS INTACT AT THE TIME OF PRODUCTION AND MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. DEVICE LABELING ADDRESSES: ""BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.

TREATMENT SHOULD BE DETERMINED IN CONSULTATION WITH A HEMATO-ONCOLOGIST."" ""FORMATION OF FIBROUS TISSUE AROUND AN IMPLANTED DEVICE IS A NORMAL PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE. FIBROUS CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE REMAINS A COMMON COMPLICATION FOLLOWING BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY AND IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. THE CAUSE OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS UNKNOWN, HOWEVER IT IS MOST LIKELY MULTIFACTORIAL AND MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HAEMATOMA, AND SEROMA. CONTRACTURE DEVELOPS TO VARYING DEGREES, UNILATERALLY OR BILATERALLY, AND MAY OCCUR WITHIN WEEKS TO YEARS AFTER SURGERY. CONTRACTURE OF THE FIBROUS CAPSULAR TISSUE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT MAY CAUSE A RANGE OF SYMPTOMS INCLUDING FIRMNESS, DISCOMFORT, PAIN, DISTORTION, PALPABILITY, AND/OR DISPLACEMENT.

BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. BREAST IMPLANTS RUPTURE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. RUPTURES CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO RUPTURE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, STRESSING THE IMPLANT DURING IMPLANTATION AND WEAKENING IT, FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL, EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED), TRAUMA, COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING, AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE.

I DECIDED TO HAVE A SMOOTH SILICONE IMPLANT PUT IN DURING THE SURGERY RATHER THAN COME BACK LATER FOR ADDITIONAL RECONSTRUCTION.

YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM.

THIS TIME IT DID NOT HELP, SO GIVEN DOXYCYCLINE, THIS FUELED TO ENTIRE BODY. WOKE UP WITH SKIN ON FIRE AND CRAWLING BUG SENSATIONS THAT WERE SO INTENSE I HAD TROUBLE FUNCTIONING DURING THE DAY OR SLEEPING AT NIGHT. WAS PLACED ON PERINTHIONE CREAM WHICH ALSO MADE THINGS WORSE. THEN GRANULES BEGAN TO COME OUT OF SKIN AND FORM CHRONIC WEEPING WOUNDS. TESTING SHOWED NO INFECTION, BLOODWORK SHOWED NOTHING YET HEALTH DETERIORATED RAPIDLY. DOCTORS OTHER MEDICATIONS THAT ONLY FUELED MY SYMPTOMS AND MADE LITERALLY MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS SLOWLY DYING. INFLAMMATION OF THE STOMACH WAS SEVERE AND PAINFUL, HEAD PAIN, DIZZINESS, MUSCLE AND JOINT PAIN AND WEAKNESS, COULD NOT PHYSICALLY DO ANYTHING WITHOUT FEELING LIKE I WOULD PASS OUT OR SPREAD LESIONS, GRANULES WERE COMING OUT OF THE SKIN EVERYWHERE ESPECIALLY AFTER SHOWERING, THESE SAME GRANULES SHOWED UP IN A BARIUM TEST I HAD DONE YEARS LATER IN THE SMALL INTESTINE AND DOCTORS IGNORED IT, BUT I WAS SHOWN IT ON ONE OF THE X-RAYS. MY CURRENT PHYSICIAN WAS UNABLE TO SEE THIS X-RAY, WE ONLY GET WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION OF ANY OF MY VISUAL TESTS THAT WERE RUN AND SOME I HAVE NEVER BEEN SHOWN WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE. I WOULD LIKE IT MANDATORY PATIENTS SEE THEIR TESTING THE DAY OF THE TEST! VERY UPSET ABOUT THIS, IF THEY CAN BILL ME FOR THE TEST THEN WHERE IS MY RIGHT TO ACTUALLY SEE IT! I HAVE BEEN REFUSED ADVANCED TESTING, I HAVE BEEN REFUSED EXPLORATORY SURGERY, I HAVE BEEN REFUSED A BODY SCAN. I HAVE BEEN REFUSED EMERGENCY CARE, OR MEDICAL CARE FOR THAT MATTER. I DID FINALLY TAKE PHOTOS OF THE GRANULES COMING OUT OF MY BODY WITH A MARCO LENS AND TO MY HORROR IT LOOKED LIKE TINY PIECES OF PLASTIC SURROUNDED BY SKIN CELLS. WHEN I FINALLY PASSED OUT AND STARTED HAVING VISION PROBLEMS AFTER SHOWING THESE PHOTOS TO MY CURRENT DOCTOR HE FINALLY TOLD ME TO GET MY IMPLANTS OUT. I HAD GONE TO MY SURGEON TEN YEARS AFTER MY FIRST IMPLANT TS TO HAVE THEM REPLACED BUT HE ADVISED ME THAT THEY ARE GOOD THROUGH A LIFETIME AND IF I WASN'T HAVING ISSUES NOT TO WORRY.

TOOK Z-PAC AND GONE FOR EIGHT MONTHS THEN RETURNED, HAD ANOTHER BIOPSY THAT SHOWED INFLAMED PORE, BUT RASHES CONTINUED TO GET WORSE SO PLACED ON Z-PAC AGAIN. THIS TIME IT DID NOT HELP, SO GIVEN DOXYCYCLINE, THIS FUELED TO ENTIRE BODY. WOKE UP WITH SKIN ON FIRE AND CRAWLING BUG SENSATIONS THAT WERE SO INTENSE I HAD TROUBLE FUNCTIONING DURING THE DAY OR SLEEPING AT NIGHT. WAS PLACED ON PERINTHIONE CREAM WHICH ALSO MADE THINGS WORSE. THEN GRANULES BEGAN TO COME OUT OF SKIN AND FORM CHRONIC WEEPING WOUNDS. TESTING SHOWED NO INFECTION, BLOODWORK SHOWED NOTHING YET HEALTH DETERIORATED RAPIDLY. DOCTORS OTHER MEDICATIONS THAT ONLY FUELED MY SYMPTOMS AND MADE LITERALLY MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS SLOWLY DYING. INFLAMMATION OF THE STOMACH WAS SEVERE AND PAINFUL, HEAD PAIN, DIZZINESS, MUSCLE AND JOINT PAIN AND WEAKNESS, COULD NOT PHYSICALLY DO ANYTHING WITHOUT FEELING LIKE I WOULD PASS OUT OR SPREAD LESIONS, GRANULES WERE COMING OUT OF THE SKIN EVERYWHERE ESPECIALLY AFTER SHOWERING, THESE SAME GRANULES SHOWED UP IN A BARIUM TEST I HAD DONE YEARS LATER IN THE SMALL INTESTINE AND DOCTORS IGNORED IT, BUT I WAS SHOWN IT ON ONE OF THE X-RAYS. MY CURRENT PHYSICIAN WAS UNABLE TO SEE THIS X-RAY, WE ONLY GET WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION OF ANY OF MY VISUAL TESTS THAT WERE RUN AND SOME I HAVE NEVER BEEN SHOWN WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE. I WOULD LIKE IT MANDATORY PATIENTS SEE THEIR TESTING THE DAY OF THE TEST! VERY UPSET ABOUT THIS, IF THEY CAN BILL ME FOR THE TEST THEN WHERE IS MY RIGHT TO ACTUALLY SEE IT! I HAVE BEEN REFUSED ADVANCED TESTING, I HAVE BEEN REFUSED EXPLORATORY SURGERY, I HAVE BEEN REFUSED A BODY SCAN. I HAVE BEEN REFUSED EMERGENCY CARE, OR MEDICAL CARE FOR THAT MATTER. I DID FINALLY TAKE PHOTOS OF THE GRANULES COMING OUT OF MY BODY WITH A MARCO LENS AND TO MY HORROR IT LOOKED LIKE TINY PIECES OF PLASTIC SURROUNDED BY SKIN CELLS. WHEN I FINALLY PASSED OUT AND STARTED HAVING VISION PROBLEMS AFTER SHOWING THESE PHOTOS TO MY CURRENT DOCTOR HE FINALLY TOLD ME TO GET MY IMPLANTS OUT. I HAD GONE TO MY SURGEON TEN YEARS AFTER MY FIRST IMPLANT TS TO HAVE THEM REPLACED BUT HE ADVISED ME THAT THEY ARE GOOD THROUGH A LIFETIME AND IF I WASN'T HAVING ISSUES NOT TO WORRY.

BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. BREAST IMPLANTS RUPTURE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. RUPTURES CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO RUPTURE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, STRESSING THE IMPLANT DURING IMPLANTATION AND WEAKENING IT, FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL, EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED), TRAUMA, COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING, AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF RUPTURE FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT. IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF RUPTURE. LABORATORY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RUPTURE ARE ONGOING. SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SEE TABLE 4 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING MRI SCREENING. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE. IF RUPTURE OCCURS, SILICONE GEL MAY EITHER REMAIN WITHIN THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), MOVE OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE (EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), OR MOVE OUTSIDE THE BREAST (GEL MIGRATION).

FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTER REGARDING EVENT, PRODUCT, OR PATIENT DETAILS HAS BEEN REQUESTED. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. DEVICE LABELING ADDRESSES: ""BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: ...REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, INFECTION. PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER THESE ADDITIONAL SURGERIES. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF DEFLATION.""

FAST FORWARD: THE SILICONE HAS MIGRATED INTO MY ENTIRE BODY, I NOW HAVE SYSTEMIC SILICOSIS, 2 AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE, HAD SILICONE GRANULOMAS REMOVED FROM MY RIBS AND SILICONE DEPOSITS REMOVED FROM MY VULVA. I STILL HAVE SILICONE IN MY LYMPH NODES AND CHEST WALL (WHICH CAN'T BE REMOVED AS TOO DANGEROUS). I NOW HAVE A BACTERIAL INFECTION WHICH IS IN MY BODY AND BLOODSTREAM FROM THE RUPTURED SALINE IMPLANTS AND IS CAUSING HAVOC! BEEN IN HOSPITAL 3 TIMES NOW SINCE THE WEEK BEFORE (B)(6) 2015, I HAVE HAD SEPTICEMIA TWICE IN 3 WEEKS. I'M IN THIS PLACE MORE THAN AT HOME. MY LIFE HAS BEEN RUINED THROUGH MY TRUST IN THE PLASTIC SURGEON AND THE (B)(6) AND THE MFRS WHO I THOUGHT KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING BUT NOW KNOWN NONE OF THEM DO. IT'S A GREEDY BUSINESS WHICH MAKES BILLIONS WORLD WIDE PUTTING THESE TOXIC BAGS OF SILICONE AND SALINE IN WOMEN'S BODIES AND NOT KNOWING THE LONG TERM EFFECTS. THIS BLOODY MAY KILL ME IN THE END BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET THIS SILICONE AND BACTERIA OUT OF MY BODY. BUT I'M GOING TO KEEP BANGING ON ABOUT THIS WHILE I CAN AND IF STOPS JUST ONE WOMAN GOING THROUGH WHAT I HAVE AND GOING DOWN THAT TOXIC PATH THEN IT'S BEEN WORTH IT.

FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE AUTHOR REGARDING EVENT, PRODUCT, OR PATIENT DETAILS HAS BEEN REQUESTED. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. DEVICE LABELING: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. BREAST IMPLANTS RUPTURE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. RUPTURES CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO RUPTURE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, STRESSING THE IMPLANT DURING IMPLANTATION AND WEAKENING IT, FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL, EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED), TRAUMA, COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING, AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF RUPTURE FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT. IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF RUPTURE. LABORATORY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RUPTURE ARE ONGOING. SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SEE TABLE 4 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING MRI SCREENING. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE. IF RUPTURE OCCURS, SILICONE GEL MAY EITHER REMAIN WITHIN THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), MOVE OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE (EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), OR MOVE OUTSIDE THE BREAST (GEL MIGRATION). THERE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY THAT RUPTURE MAY PROGRESS FROM INTRACAPSULAR TO EXTRACAPSULAR AND BEYOND."|STYLE 153 SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|UNK STYLE 153|12/02/2016||||N|R||0HP|FTR|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||NI|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True
5808310|50110352|D|1||THOUSANDS OF KNOWN WOMEN ARE SICK FROM A SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. EACH OF THEM KNOWS THE TRUTH NOW. FDA HAS SOMEHOW ALLOWED THE SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT MFRS TO HIDE THE HIGH LEVEL OF TOXICITY OF SILICONE, PLATINUM AND OF THE OTHER 35 + DANGEROUS CHEMICALS THAT USE TO MAKE SILICONE AND SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS, THAT TRIGGER A BIOCHEMICAL MOLECULAR DISRUPTION THAT BRING UP SICKNESSES THAT WERE NOT PRESENT BEFORE THE IMPLANTS AND THAT GO AWAY AFTER THE EXPLANTS, WITH SOME CASES OF IRREVERSIBLE DAMAGE. ON NOVEMBER 17, 2006, THE FDA'S APPROVAL ORDER REQUIRED SIX VERY SPECIFIC POST-APPROVAL STUDIES CONDITIONS, TWO OF THE STUDIES TO MONITOR LONG TERM SAFETY FOR TEN YEARS. THEY WERE NOT FOLLOWED AND SO THERE IS NO SAFETY DATA FOR THOSE STUDIES. THE ADJUNCT 5-YEAR STUDY HAD A LOW F/U RATE OF 13.8%, THE LARGE STUDY WAS ALLOWED TO BE CUT SHORT AT YEAR 7 INSTEAD OF 10 WITH A LOW F/U RATE OF 20.1% AND IT WAS IGNORED, THE CORE STUDY HAD A F/U RATE OF 62% BUT THE REPORT SCHEDULE STOPS SHORT AT YEAR 6 INSTEAD OF 10 ON NOVEMBER 13, 2012. THE FDA MENTOR PMA, THE MANUFACTURE DOCUMENT, STATES SHELF LIFE TO BE FIVE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF STERILIZATION, YET THEY ARE MARKETED FOR UP TO 10 YEARS TO STAY IN THE BODY WITHOUT ANY SAFETY EVIDENCE. THE (B)(6) STUDY FROM 2013 RUN BY THE (B)(6), FUNDED BY THE THREE BREAST IMPLANT MFRS, DOES NOT QUALIFY AS AN INDEPENDENT STUDY FOR THE ASTOUNDING CONFLICT OF INTEREST IN REGARDS TO THE PLASTIC SURGEONS THAT PROFIT LARGELY FROM THE SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS AND, THE MFRS THEMSELVES THAT PROFIT FROM THEIR OWN SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. ALL THE PREVIOUS SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT SYMPTOMS FROM THE 1990S ARE REPEATING THEMSELVES WITH THE CURRENT SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS, THUS PROVING RECURRING LACK OF SAFETY. A FEW PEOPLE FOLLOWING THIS MATTER HAVE MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED, BUT NOW THOUSANDS OF WOMEN HAVE GROUPED TOGETHER TO SHARE THEIR RECORDS WITH (B)(6) AND FOR THEIR OWN PROTECTION THEY HAVE ALSO TAKEN MEASURES TO SHARE THEIR RECORDS AMONG THEMSELVES AND HAVE THOSE RECORDS SAFEGUARDED WITH THEIR OWN ATTORNEYS. PRIVATE INTERESTS CANNOT SILENCE OR BUY OUT RECORDED MEDICAL EVIDENCE FROM THOUSANDS OF SICK WOMEN FROM SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS ANY LONGER.

5900555|53035399|D|1||"TWO YEARS AGO I BEGAN TO HAVE LUMPS AND PAIN IN MY BREASTS AND ARM PITS. EVERY DOCTOR TOLD ME THERE WAS NO WAY THIS COULD BE MY IMPLANTS. THEY WERE EXTREMELY WRONG. I HAD TO PAY FOR REMOVAL AND TESTING OF IMPLANTS AND TISSUE. THEY FOUND PROPIONIBACTERIUM. THIS BACTERIA DOES NOT SHOW UP ON STANDARD LAB TESTS, AND THE ONLY WAY FOR ME TO TELL OF INFECTION WAS REMOVAL. HERE'S MY STORY, TWO YEARS AGO, ON A BEAUTIFUL, SUNNY (B)(6) DAY, I WOKE UP TO A HUGE LUMP UNDER MY ARMPIT. IT COULD BARELY LIFT MY KIDS WITHOUT EXTREME PAIN. MY HYPOCHONDRIAC SELF WAS PRAYING IT WASN'T ANYTHING SERIOUS. THAT'S WHEN I BELIEVE IT ALL BEGAN. WHAT MY PRIMARY DOCTOR LABELED AS AN ENLARGED LYMPH NODE FROM AN INFECTED HAIR FOLLICLE SOON ASPIRATED TO WHAT I NOW BELIEVE WAS THE BEGINNING OF MY BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESS. ONE MONTH LATER, WE WERE SURPRISED TO FIND OUT WE WERE PREGNANT WITH OUR 3RD BABY, OUR SWEET (B)(6). STILL UNSURE WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH MY BODY, THE PAIN AND LUMPS AROUND MY BREASTS AND ARMPITS ONLY INCREASED. ALL OF MY PHYSICIANS AT THIS POINT WERE CLUELESS. THEY CHALKED IT UP TO HORMONES. AFTER ALL, A WOMAN'S BODY IS EVER CHANGING DURING PREGNANCY. AFTER (B)(6) WAS BORN, I HAD MULTIPLE BREAST ULTRASOUNDS. ALL COMING BACK CLEAR. I WAS RELIEVED, NO CANCER. HOWEVER, WHAT WAS LURKING WAS STILL A HORRIBLE ILLNESS, ONE THAT WOULD SOON CONSUME EVERY PART OF ME. I BEGAN TO LOOSE MY HAIR IN HUGE CLUMPS. MY ONCE THICK MANE, QUICKLY THINNED AND BECAME BRITTLE. AGAIN, I THOUGHT OK, MY HORMONES ARE JUST REGULATING. BUT THEN CAME THE EXTREME BRAIN FOG, CONFUSION, NECK AND BACK PAIN, VISION DISTURBANCES, EYE TWITCH, MUSCLE SPASMS, FULL BODY FATIGUE, EAR PAIN/PRESSURE, HEADACHES, FOOD INTOLERANCES, ALCOHOL SENSITIVITY, MOODINESS, DEPRESSION. I USED TO BE ABLE TO DO A MILLION THINGS AT ONE TIME, (MON LIFE??), AND NOW I HAD TO TELL MY BRAIN ONE THING AT A TIME. I'D CONSTANTLY BE GOING IN CIRCLES, FORGETTING WHAT I HAD JUST TOLD MYSELF OUT LOUD 10 SECONDS PRIOR. IT WAS EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING. EVERYDAY TASKS BECAME HARD TO ACCOMPLISH. I WAS EXISTING, GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS, BUT SO FAR FROM ""LIVING"". BLOOD WORK DONE, AND NOTHING. I BELIEVE THAT WAS THE DEPRESSING PART. FEELING LIKE I WAS SLOWLY DYING AND NOT SURE WHERE TO TURN FOR HELP. ALL OF THE DOCTORS KEPT TELLING ME I WAS HEALTHY. AFTER MOVING TO (B)(6), I SOUGHT HELP IN INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE. I SAW A NATUROPATH, WHO DID MORE BLOOD WORK. ALMOST ALL LOOKING IN MODERATE RANGE, AGAIN. HOWEVER, I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ADRENAL FATIGUE, TOXIC OVERLOAD AND VITAMIN DEFICIENCY.

5900555|53035399|D|1||"TWO YEARS AGO I BEGAN TO HAVE LUMPS AND PAIN IN MY BREASTS AND ARM PITS. EVERY DOCTOR TOLD ME THERE WAS NO WAY THIS COULD BE MY IMPLANTS. THEY WERE EXTREMELY WRONG. I HAD TO PAY FOR REMOVAL AND TESTING OF IMPLANTS AND TISSUE. THEY FOUND PROPIONIBACTERIUM. THIS BACTERIA DOES NOT SHOW UP ON STANDARD LAB TESTS, AND THE ONLY WAY FOR ME TO TELL OF INFECTION WAS REMOVAL. HERE'S MY STORY, TWO YEARS AGO, ON A BEAUTIFUL, SUNNY (B)(6) DAY, I WOKE UP TO A HUGE LUMP UNDER MY ARMPIT. IT COULD BARELY LIFT MY KIDS WITHOUT EXTREME PAIN. MY HYPOCHONDRIAC SELF WAS PRAYING IT WASN'T ANYTHING SERIOUS. THAT'S WHEN I BELIEVE IT ALL BEGAN. WHAT MY PRIMARY DOCTOR LABELED AS AN ENLARGED LYMPH NODE FROM AN INFECTED HAIR FOLLICLE SOON ASPIRATED TO WHAT I NOW BELIEVE WAS THE BEGINNING OF MY BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESS. ONE MONTH LATER, WE WERE SURPRISED TO FIND OUT WE WERE PREGNANT WITH OUR 3RD BABY, OUR SWEET (B)(6). STILL UNSURE WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH MY BODY, THE PAIN AND LUMPS AROUND MY BREASTS AND ARMPITS ONLY INCREASED. ALL OF MY PHYSICIANS AT THIS POINT WERE CLUELESS. THEY CHALKED IT UP TO HORMONES. AFTER ALL, A WOMAN'S BODY IS EVER CHANGING DURING PREGNANCY. AFTER (B)(6) WAS BORN, I HAD MULTIPLE BREAST ULTRASOUNDS. ALL COMING BACK CLEAR. I WAS RELIEVED, NO CANCER. HOWEVER, WHAT WAS LURKING WAS STILL A HORRIBLE ILLNESS, ONE THAT WOULD SOON CONSUME EVERY PART OF ME. I BEGAN TO LOOSE MY HAIR IN HUGE CLUMPS. MY ONCE THICK MANE, QUICKLY THINNED AND BECAME BRITTLE. AGAIN, I THOUGHT OK, MY HORMONES ARE JUST REGULATING. BUT THEN CAME THE EXTREME BRAIN FOG, CONFUSION, NECK AND BACK PAIN, VISION DISTURBANCES, EYE TWITCH, MUSCLE SPASMS, FULL BODY FATIGUE, EAR PAIN/PRESSURE, HEADACHES, FOOD INTOLERANCES, ALCOHOL SENSITIVITY, MOODINESS, DEPRESSION. I USED TO BE ABLE TO DO A MILLION THINGS AT ONE TIME, (MON LIFE??), AND NOW I HAD TO TELL MY BRAIN ONE THING AT A TIME. I'D CONSTANTLY BE GOING IN CIRCLES, FORGETTING WHAT I HAD JUST TOLD MYSELF OUT LOUD 10 SECONDS PRIOR. IT WAS EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING. EVERYDAY TASKS BECAME HARD TO ACCOMPLISH. I WAS EXISTING, GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS, BUT SO FAR FROM ""LIVING"". BLOOD WORK DONE, AND NOTHING. I BELIEVE THAT WAS THE DEPRESSING PART. FEELING LIKE I WAS SLOWLY DYING AND NOT SURE WHERE TO TURN FOR HELP. ALL OF THE DOCTORS KEPT TELLING ME I WAS HEALTHY. AFTER MOVING TO (B)(6), I SOUGHT HELP IN INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE. I SAW A NATUROPATH, WHO DID MORE BLOOD WORK. ALMOST ALL LOOKING IN MODERATE RANGE, AGAIN. HOWEVER, I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ADRENAL FATIGUE, TOXIC OVERLOAD AND VITAMIN DEFICIENCY. I WAS PUT ON NATURAL SUPPLEMENTS AND HERBS, ALONG WITH A NATURAL DIET FILLED WITH ORGANIC FOODS. COMBINING THAT WITH ACUPUNCTURE AND CHIROPRACTIC CARE, AFTER FOUR MONTHS I STARTED TO SEE MORE GOOD DAYS THAN BAD. BUT STILL NOT FEELING LIKE MYSELF, I KEPT SEARCHING.

5801905|49945687|D|1||OVER THE LAST 15 YEARS MY HEALTH HAS DECLINED. THE FIRST 10 OF THOSE YEARS I DEVELOPED FATIGUE, HORMONAL IMBALANCES, REOCCURRING YEAST INFECTIONS, ACNE AND RANDOM PAIN THROUGHOUT MY BODY ALONG WITH VARIOUS OTHER UNEXPLAINED AILMENTS. THESE SYMPTOMS CONTINUALLY GOT WORSE AND MORE SYMPTOMS STARTED OCCURRING. THE PAST 4 YEARS I BEGIN HAVING SO MUCH PAIN IN MY FEET AND LEGS THAT I COULD BARELY WALK. I WAS TESTED FOR PLANTARS FASCIITIS WHICH CAME BACK NEGATIVE, PHYSICAL THERAPY AND CHIROPRACTIC APPOINTMENTS BECAUSE WAS TOLD POSSIBLE NERVE PINCH IN LOWER BACK. THREE YEARS AGO THE PAIN CREPT UP INTO MY HANDS AND ARMS AND CONTINUING THROUGHOUT MY WHOLE BODY FEELING AS THOUGH SOMEONE HAD DUMPED CHEMICAL ACID ON MY BODY TO THE POINT ALL I COULD DO IS LAY IN BED AT NIGHT AND WISH I WOULD DIE. IN APPROX (B)(6) 2014, MY WHOLE BODY DECIDED TO REACT BY NOT BEING UNABLE TO REGULATE ITS BODY TEMPERATURE, EXTREME DIZZINESS TO THE POINT OF BLACKOUTS, EXTREME FATIGUE TO WHERE I BARELY COULD FUNCTION FOR A FEW HOURS THEN WOULD HAVE TO SLEEP, I FELT AS THOUGH I WAS SUFFOCATING ALL THE TIME, MY HANDS BEGAN SHAKING TO THE POINT I COULD NOT HOLD MY PHONE OR A GLASS. I COULD NOT THINK CLEARLY AND WAS HAVING EXTREME MEMORY LOSS, I WENT FROM HAVING 20/20 VISION TO NEEDING TRIFOCALS IN A MATTER OF LESS THAN A YEAR. THE PAIN IN MY BODY GOT WORSE AND NEVER LET UP. I HAVE TO KEEP MY HOME AT ABOUT 68 DEGREES BECAUSE HEAT MAKES THE CHEMICAL ACID BURNING INCREASE 10 FOLD, I HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME LEAVING MY HOME BECAUSE I LIVE IN THE DESERT AND THE SUN LITERALLY MAKES MY SKIN FEEL AS THOUGH IT IS BLISTERING. BETWEEN (B)(6) 2014 AND (B)(6) 2015 I LOST (B)(6) POUNDS UNEXPLAINABLY. ON (B)(6) 2015 MY PRIMARY PHYSICIAN WROTE ME OUT OF WORK FOR A WEEK THEN 2 WEEKS THEN FOR AN UNDETERMINED AMOUNT OF TIME AND SAID I NEEDED TO SEE A NEUROLOGIST. I FOLLOWED UP WITH A NEUROLOGIST WHO SAID HE BELIEVED I HAD PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY, BUT PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY DID NOT FIT ALL THE SYMPTOMS I WAS HAVING. AT THIS POINT I STARTED GOING TO THE (B)(6) CLINIC IN LATE (B)(6) 2015 WHO BY JUST MY SYMPTOMS FIGURED I HAD EITHER LUPUS, MS, HODGKIN'S DISEASE, LYME DISEASE OR SOME OTHER AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE. THEY PERFORMED MULTIPLE MRI'S, CAT SCANS, PET SCANS, BLOOD AND URINE TESTS, NERVE TESTS, HEART TESTS, LUNG TESTS AND MANY OTHER TESTS TO TRY AND DETERMINE WHY I WAS SICK. THEY DID DETERMINE THAT MY BLOOD PRESSURE WAS EXTREMELY LOW AND WOULD BOTTOM OUT IF I STOOD OR MOVE TOO QUICKLY CAUSING THE DIZZINESS AND BLACKOUTS. WHICH IS OPPOSITE OF WHAT I WAS 4 YEARS AGO TAKING MEDICINE FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. THEY DETERMINED I HAD EARLY STAGES OF EMPHYSEMA AND COPD. THE PET SCAN SHOWED NO TYPE OF CANCER, AND MY BLOOD WORK CAME BACK FINE OTHER THAN MY C-REACTIVE PROTEIN WAS AT 18. AT THIS POINT THEY DETERMINED I HAD AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE FOR UNK REASONS WITH SMALL FIBER NEUROPATHY. NONE OF THE MEDICATIONS OR THE INTERVENOUS STEROIDS RELIEVED MY SYMPTOMS. IN (B)(6) 2015, MY DAUGHTER DISCOVERED WHAT IS KNOWN AS BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESS. ALL THE SYMPTOMS LISTED FOR THIS WAS WHAT I WAS DEALING WITH. I HAD MY IMPLANTS REMOVED (B)(6) ENBLOCK STYLE WITH CAPSULES COMPLETELY REMOVED. SINCE THIS TIME I HAVE STEADILY FELT MY HEALTH RETURNING. SINCE SURGERY MY MEMORY HAS GOTTEN BETTER ALONG WITH WHAT I CALL THE BRAIN FOG, THE PAIN ALL OVER MY BODY HAS LESSENED TO MAYBE AN 8 INSTEAD OF A 10, THE SHAKING ONLY OCCURS ONCE IN AWHILE. I AM FAR FROM BEING BETTER, BUT I CAN TELL I AM AT LEAST RECOVERING SLOWLY.|MENTOR TEXTURED BREAST IMPLANTS||07/13/2016||||*|*||I|FWM|0.0||BREAST IMPLANTS|||||||MENTOR|||||||True

BREAST AUGMENTATION WAS DONE 11 YEARS PREVIOUSLY WITH SUBGLANDULAR PLACEMENT OF ALLERGAN TEXTURIZED PROSTHESES THROUGH THE INFRAMAMMARY APPROACH. THE BREAST AUGMENTATION WAS DONE ELSEWHERE. DESPITE OUR EFFORTS TO GET INFO ABOUT THE IMPLANT FROM THE PLASTIC SURGEON THAT HAD IMPLANTED THE DEVICE, WE HAVE NO SERIAL NUMBER OR PRODUCT CODE. THE PT HAD NO FURTHER INFO. AN ULTRASOUND AND MAMMOGRAPHY IMAGES WHICH WERE DONE 4 MONTHS EARLIER WERE NORMAL. THE WOMAN DENIED ANY HISTORY OF BREAST TRAUMA, PRODROMAL ILLNESS, PAIN, PURULENT DRAINAGE, LOCAL SIGN OF INFECTION, NIGHT SWEATS, WEIGHT LOSS, POOR APPETITE OR FEVER. AT PHYSICAL EXAMINATION BREAST ASYMMETRY WAS OBVIOUS. THE RIGHT BREAST WAS SWOLLEN, FIRM AND SENSITIVE TO DEEP PALPATION. THE LEFT BREAST WAS NORMAL. NO SIGN OF LOCAL INFECTION WERE OBSERVED. IN (B)(6) 2015, AN ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA WAS FOUND IN THE PERIPROSTHETIC FLUID AND FIBRINOID DEPOSITS WITHIN THE PERIPROSTHETIC CAPSULE, OF THE RIGHT BREAST. THE LEFT BREAST WAS WITHOUT ANY CLINICAL, LAB, IMAGING OR HISTOPATHOLOGICAL EVIDENCE OF DISEASE. ON (B)(6) 2015, THE PT UNDERWENT BILATERAL TOTAL CAPSULECTOMY AND IMPLANT REMOVAL. NOW, MORE THAN A YEAR AFTER, THE PT IS DISEASE FREE. CT PET SCANS, INCLUDING A RECENT SCAN, DO NOT SHOW ANY SIGNS OF THE LYMPHOMA.|ALLERGAN SILICONE TEXTURED BREAST IMPLANT||07/24/2016||||Y|*||0HP|FTR|1.0||ALLERGAN SILICONE TEXTURED BREAST IMPLANT|||||||ALLERGAN|||||||True
