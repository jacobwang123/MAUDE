DEVICE LABELING: UNDERGOING ANY TYPE OF SURGERY INVOLVES RISKS. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF LOCAL COMPLICATIONS (PROBLEMS AT OR NEAR THE BREAST/SURGICAL INCISION SITE) THAT MAY OCCUR AFTER YOUR BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY. THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS PRESENT RESULTS FROM ALLERGANÂ¿S CORE CLINICAL STUDY CONDUCTED ON NATRELLE Â® SILICONE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANTS. ONE OF THE KEY COMPLICATIONS REPORTED IS CALLED Â¿CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE.Â¿ CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS A TIGHTENING OF THE SCAR TISSUE (ALSO CALLED A CAPSULE) THAT NORMALLY FORMS AROUND THE BREAST IMPLANT DURING THE HEALING PROCESS AFTER SURGERY. IN SOME WOMEN, THE SCAR TISSUE (CAPSULE) SQUEEZES THE IMPLANT. THIS RESULTS IN FIRMNESS OR HARDENING OF THE BREAST, AND IT IS A RISK FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE. DEGREES OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE ARE CLASSIFIED BY THE BAKER GRADING SCALE.1 CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BAKER GRADES III AND IV ARE THE MOST SEVERE. BAKER GRADE III OFTEN RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SURGERY (REOPERATION) BECAUSE OF PAIN AND POSSIBLY ABNORMAL APPEARANCE. BAKER GRADE IV USUALLY RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR REOPERATION BECAUSE OF PAIN AND UNACCEPTABLE APPEARANCE. OTHER REASONS FOR REOPERATIONS ARE DISCUSSED IN THE ONLINE PATIENT LABELING IN SECTION 5.5 ALLERGANÂ¿S CLINICAL STUDY RESULTS: WHAT ARE THE MAIN REASONS FOR REOPERATION? GLOSSARY: CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE - A TIGHTENING OF THE SCAR TISSUE (ALSO CALLED A CAPSULE) THAT NORMALLY FORMS AROUND THE BREAST IMPLANT DURING THE HEALING PROCESS AFTER SURGERY. IN SOME WOMEN, THE SCAR TISSUE (CAPSULE) SQUEEZES THE IMPLANT. WHEN THIS OCCURS, IT IS CALLED CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. THIS RESULTS IN FIRMNESS OR HARDENING OF THE BREAST, AND IS A RISK FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS CLASSIFIED BY BAKER GRADES. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BAKER GRADES III AND IV ARE THE MOST SEVERE. BAKER GRADE III OFTEN RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SURGERY (REOPERATION) BECAUSE OF PAIN AND POSSIBLY ABNORMAL APPEARANCE. BAKER GRADE IV USUALLY RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SURGERY (REOPERATION) BECAUSE OF PAIN AND UNACCEPTABLE APPEARANCE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BAKER GRADE II MAY ALSO RESULT IN THE NEED FOR SURGERY. EACH GRADE IS DESCRIBED BELOW. BAKER GRADE I Â¿ NORMALLY SOFT AND NATURAL APPEARANCE. BAKER GRADE II Â¿ A LITTLE FIRM, BUT BREAST LOOKS NORMAL. BAKER GRADE III Â¿ MORE FIRM THAN NORMAL, AND MAY LOOK ABNORMAL (CHANGE IN SHAPE). BAKER GRADE IV Â¿ HARD, OBVIOUS DISTORTION, AND RUPTURE - A HOLE OR TEAR IN THE SHELL OF THE IMPLANT THAT ALLOWS SILICONE GEL FILLER MATERIAL TO LEAK FROM THE SHELL. RUPTURES CAN BE INTRACAPSULAR (INSIDE THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT) OR EXTRACAPSULAR (OUTSIDE THE SCAR TISSUE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT). WARNINGS: RUPTURE OF A SILICONE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT IS MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR SURGEON WILL KNOW THAT YOUR IMPLANTS HAVE A RUPTURE. THEREFORE YOU WILL NEED REGULAR MRI SCREENINGS OVER YOUR LIFETIME IN ORDER TO DETERMINE IF RUPTURE IS PRESENT. YOU SHOULD HAVE AN MRI 3 YEARS AFTER YOUR BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY AND THEN EVERY 2 YEARS AFTER THAT FOR AS LONG AS YOU HAVE YOUR BREAST IMPLANTS. IF IMPLANT RUPTURE IS NOTED ON AN MRI, YOU SHOULD HAVE THE IMPLANT REMOVED, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT.|STYLE 45 SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|45-550|07/27/2017||||N|R||0HP|FTR|1.0|04/22/2011|PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||1266902|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

WHITE PARTICLE MATERIAL WAS NOTED ON THE OUTER SURFACE OF THE DEVICE. A LEAK TEST WAS PERFORMED AND NO LEAKS WERE NOTED. NO BLOCKAGE WAS NOTED IN THE PORT HOLE OF THE DIAPHRAGM VALVE. THE DEVICE WAS NOTED AS INTACT AND FUNCTIONAL. A REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD HAS BEEN INITIATED AND COMPLETED; DHR COMPLETED AND NO DEVIATIONS/NON-CONFORMANCES FOUND. FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTER REGARDING EVENT, PRODUCT, OR PATIENT DETAILS HAS BEEN REQUESTED. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, ASYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. DEFLATION Â¿ BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS DEFLATE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. DEFLATION CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO DEFLATE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS; FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL; EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED); TRAUMA; COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING; AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF DEFLATION FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT; HOWEVER, IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF DEFLATION. UNSATISFACTORY RESULTS Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE INFORMED THAT DISSATISFACTION WITH COSMETIC RESULTS RELATED TO SUCH THINGS AS SCAR DEFORMITY, HYPERTROPHIC SCARRING, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, INCORRECT SIZE, AND IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY MAY OCCUR. CAREFUL SURGICAL PLANNING AND TECHNIQUE CAN MINIMIZE, BUT NOT PRECLUDE, THE RISK OF SUCH RESULTS. PRE-EXISTING ASYMMETRY MAY NOT BE ENTIRELY CORRECTABLE. REVISION SURGERY MAY BE INDICATED TO MAINTAIN PATIENT SATISFACTION BUT CARRIES ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS AND RISKS.|STYLE 68 SALINE FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|68HP-425|07/25/2017||08/28/2013||R|Y||0HP|FWM|1.0|04/30/2016|PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||2295248|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

POST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: BILATERAL CAPSULE FORMATION WITH CHRONIC ABSCESS AND PURULENCY, RIGHT BREAST; LEAKING IMPLANT, RIGHT BREAST. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: BILATERAL OPEN CAPSULECTOMIES; IMPLANT MATERIAL REMOVAL. PROCEDURE: THE PT WAS PREPARED AND DRAPED UNDER GENERAL ENDOTRACHEAL ANESTHESIA. ALL THE RISKS, ALTERNATIVES AND IMPONDERABLES WERE AGAIN DISCUSSED WITH THE PT PRIOR TO PROCEEDING. OUTSIDE OPERATIVE NOTES IMPLIED THIS HAD 180CC SILICONE IMPLANTS WITH A 20CC SALINE SHELL ON EACH SIDE. HER LEFT BREAST WAS LARGER THAN THE RIGHT WITH SYMPTOMATIC BILATERAL CAPSULES, RIGHT GREATER THAN LEFT. SHE ALSO HAD CHRONIC RECURRENT INFECTIONS ON THE RIGHT BREAST; MOST RECENTLY TREATED APPROX ONE MONTH AGO ON THE RIGHT SIDE. BOTH BREASTS WERE EXPLORED THROUGH BILATERAL INFRAMAMMARY INCISIONS. RIGHT SIDE WAS DONE FIRST AND ON ENTERING THE BREAST THERE WAS FRANK PURULENCY; APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF CUP FULL. THIS WAS SENT OFF FOR A STAT GRAM STAIN WHICH LATER CAME BACK SHOWING WHITE BLOOD CELLS, NO ORGANISMS, COMPATIBLE WITH A STERILE ABSCESS. IN ADDITION TO THIS, THERE WAS A VERY SIGNIFICANT CAPSULE WITH CALCIFICATION, AND THERE APPEARED TO BE A HEMATOMA FORMATION WITHIN THE CAPSULE. CAPSULE WAS VERY TEDIOUSLY REMOVED AFTER THE SILICONE IMPLANT WAS REMOVED. THE SILICONE IMPLANT WEIGHTED APPROX 188 GRAMS AND HAD A LEAK IN THE IMPLANT WITH SILICONE BLEED AROUND THE IMPLANT. BOTH OF THESE IMPLANTS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE 180CC WITH 20CC SALINE ENVELOPE. NEITHER HAD THE SALINE ENVELOPE INTACT AND WHEN THE LEFT SIDE WAS REMOVED IT TURNED OUT TO BE A 130CC IMPLANT, NO 180CC AS THE OPERATIVE DATA SHOWED THAT STAFF HAD. THE LEFT SIDE WAS DONE IN A SIMILAR FASHION, AGAIN WITH INTENSE CAPSULE FORMATION BUT THE IMPLANT WAS INTACT. BECAUSE OF THE OBVIOUS PURULENCY ENCOUNTERED AS WELL AS THE GROSS DISCREPANCY OF THE IMPLANTS, IT WAS FELT IT VERY IMPRUDENT TO REPLACE THE IMPLANTS AFTER THE BILATERAL IMPLANT REMOVAL, IMPLANT MATERIAL AND BILATERAL FORMAL OPEN CAPSULECTOMIES. STAFF WILL NEED TO DO THAT AT A SECONDARY STAGE. THE POCKETS WERE IRRIGATED WITH COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF A SOLUTION ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AND METICULOUS HEMOSTASIS WAS ACHIEVED WITH CAUTERY AND THE POCKETS WERE CLOSED OVER 19MM BLAKE DRAIN ON EACH SIDE WITH INTERRUPTED BURIED 3-0 VICRYL FOLLOWED BY INTERRUPTED BURIED 4-0 AND 5-0 VICRYL AND A LIGHT COMPRESSIVE WRAP. BLOOD LOSS WAS NEGLIGIBLE. NO BLOOD PRODUCTS WERE GIVEN. THE PT WAS AWAKE AND LEFT THE OPERATING ROOM PER ANESTHESIA. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT RIGHT BREAST IMPLANT WEIGHT WAS 188 GRAMS, LEFT BREAST 136 GRAMS. TOTAL WEIGHT OF RIGHT BREAST IMPLANT WITH CAPSULE 246 GRAMS AND LEFT BREAST IMPLANT WITH CAPSULE 155 GRAMS.

280331|191820|D|1||"I HAD COMPLICATIONS IMMEDIATELY. I HAD TO HAVE 2 ADD'L SURGERIES TO CORRECT THE COMPLICATIONS. THEY HARDENED, MOVED IN MY CHEST CAVITY, AND THEY LEAKED. I STARTED TO ITCH IMMEDIATELY, AND BECAME ALLERGIC TO MANY THINGS. MY BODY FELT FATIGUED, I HAD MIGRAINE HEADACHES, AND COULDN'T SLEEP. I BEGAN TO ACHE ALL OVER, HAD PANIC ATTACKS, MY VISION CHANGED RAPIDLY. I KEPT REPORTING VARIOUS COMPLAINTS TO MY PHYSICIANS, NO ONE COULD HELP ME, EVEN THOUGH THEY KEPT TRYING. I BECAME DEPRESSED, MY WHOLE BODY BEGAN TO CHANGE, MY BREASTS WERE ITCHING DEEP INSIDE, WERE COMPLETELY NUMB. THEY WERE HOT TO TOUCH, AND PAINFUL, I WAS TOLD IT WOULD GO AWAY. THE SYMPTOMS PROGRESSED RAPIDLY, EACH TIME THEY WENT BACK IN, THEY USED THE SAME IMPLANTS, EVEN REFILLED THE ONE THAT LEAKED. MY MAMMOGRAMS SHOWED A BULGE, THE RADIOLOGIST ADVISED ME TO REMOVE THEM, THE PLASTIC SURGEON DENIED WHAT THE FILM SHOWED. I HAD A SONOGRAM LATER, AND IT SHOWED MY LYMPH NODES WERE SWOLLEN. THEY IDENTIFIED GEL OUTSIDE OF THE CAPSULES. MY HEALTH WAS DECLINING RAPIDLY. THE NURSES TOLD ME ABOUT THE ADVERSE EFFECTS, TWO MONTHS BEFORE THIS LITIGATION WAS TO CLOSE. I HAD TO SEE AN INTERNAL SPECIALIST, WHO DIAGNOSED ME WITH SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS, SO DID A RHEUMATOLOGIST, AND SO DID A NEUROLOGIST. I HAVE SEIZURES, CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDER, ATYPICAL LUPUS, SJOGREN'S, RAYNAUD'S, NUMEROUS OTHER CONDITIONS. I HAVE BEEN HOSPITALIZED, GONE TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM, STAYED HOME BECAUSE I AM NOW UNEMPLOYABLE. NO ONE WILL INSURE ME NOW, AND THIS IS A PARTIAL LIST OF MY SYMPTOMS, AND DISORDERS. I AM POSITIVE MY PATHOLOGIST'S REPORT SHOWED A HOLE IN MY IMPLANT. MY VISION IS VERY IMPAIRED NOW. I CAN'T GET OUT OF BED, WITHOUT HELP, AND I AM CONSTANTLY ILL. I AM IN HORRENDOUS PAIN EACH DAY. MY MEMORY IS IMPAIRED SIGNIFICANTLY. I GET LOST, I CAN'T EVEN SHOP FOR GROCERIES, OR COOK A MEAL NOW. I DON'T GO INTO A DEEP SLEEP PATTERN, MY BRAIN STAYS ON RUN, WHILE MY BODY CRIES IN PAIN. MY LEGS AND FEET STAY SWOLLEN HUGE. MY FINGERS DON'T MOVE, I HAVE CRAMPS IN MY HANDS, LEGS, AND FEET THAT MAKE MY HANDS DRAW INTO GNARLS. I HAVE NIGHT SWEATS, MY FACE IS GETTING A PINK RASH OVER MY NOSE. MY BRAIN HAS ELECTRIC LIGHT SHOWS, AND I WAKE UP EXHAUSTED. MY WHOLE LIFE HAS CHANGED. MY IMMUNE SYSTEM IS COMPROMISED, I CAN'T BE AROUND ANYONE WHO IS ILL, OR I GET ILL. I'M SO ALLERGIC TO ALL CHEMICALS, I HAVE SEVERE REACTIONS TO THEM. MY VOICE HAS CHANGED, MY SPEECH IS SLURRED, I'M NOT ME NOW. MY FACE HAS BROKEN OUT IN BLISTERS, I'M ALLERGIC TO THE SUN, AND I HAVE ASTHMA NOW. I CAN'T BEGIN TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAS HAPPENED. I HAVE SOMEONE TYPING FOR ME, MY BRAIN CAN'T PUT THE WORDS TOGETHER NOW. I HAD NONE OF THESE PROBLEMS BEFORE IMPLANTS. I WAS NEVER TOLD OF THE CHEMICALS IN IMPLANTS. I WAS TOLD THAT IT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER TO DETECT BREAST CANCER. I HAD FIBRO-CYSTIC BREAST DISEASE. I AM POSITIVE THE IMPLANTS ARE WHAT HAS CAUSED ME TO BECOME EXTREMELY DISABLED, I AM FORCED TO FILE FOR DISABILITY. I WOULD RATHER BE THE PRODUCTIVE PERSON I WAS BEFORE I HAD SILICONE IMPLANTS. I RARELY AM ABLE TO GO OUT. I CAN'T HOLD MY GRANDBABIES OR PARTICIPATE IN A NORMAL LIFE. I AM SEXUALLY NOT A LADY NOW. I CAN'T HAVE A CLIMAX, MY VAGINA IS SO DRY, AND PAINFUL. WHY DID THE FDA ALLOW THIS? I THOUGHT IMPLANTS WERE SAFE, AND HAD BEEN APPROVED. NOW I'M READING I'VE BEEN TOXICALLY POISONED. I TRY TO USE MY MIND TO CONTROL PAIN. I AM ILL, I WANT TO BE WELL, I WANT TO BE FREE FROM ALL OF THE THINGS I HAVE WRONG WITH ME NOW. I TRY SO HARD, BUT I CAN'T DO THINGS. I WILL NEVER GIVE UP TRYING. I WISH I WAS WELL ENOUGH TO BE ME AGAIN NOW. I STAY AWAY FROM THE DOCTORS, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY MORE. I CAN'T HEAR WELL, AND I'M SO TIRED. I DON'T LEAD A NORMAL LIFE. I'M SICK, AND I'M JUST TRYING TO HIDE FROM ANY MORE TESTS, OR HOSPS. THESE CHEST PAINS WERE NEVER NORMAL FOR A 35 YEAR OLD LADY WHO EXERCIZED, WAS PHYSICALLY IN SHAPE. NOW I CAN'T RAISE MY ARMS, THE PAIN GOES FROM MY BREAST CLEAR DOWN TO MY FINGERTIPS. I CAN'T TELL YOU ANY MORE, IT'S TOO UPSETTING TO LOOK AT. I HAD A HYSTERECTOMY, I HEMORRHAGED FOR MONTHS. I'VE HAD A KIDNEY STONE, MY BLADDER IS BLOCKED, INFECTED ALL THE TIME, AND THEY CAN'T DO SURGERY. I HAVE A YEAST INFECTION CONTINUALLY. MY NAILS HAVE HAD A FUNGUS. MY SKIN HAS HUGE BLOOD PLACES THE SIZE OF A MAN'S HAND, ON MY FOREARMS ALWAYS, MY SKIN IS LIKE TISSUE PAPER. I FREEZE WHEN IT IS 90 DEGREES. SINUS, OH I COULD JUST KEEP GOING ON, AND ON BUT I WON'T. I THINK YOU HAVE READ ENOUGH. I'M BACK IN KINDERGARTEN, AND I WAS INTELLIGENT ONCE.

294958|148139|D|1||"PT UNDERWENT BILATERAL AUGMENTATION MAMMOPLASTY SEVERAL YEARS AGO. APPROX THREE WEEKS AGO THEY NOTICED THAT THE LEFT BREAST HAD BECOME SIGNIFICANTLY FLAT COMPARED TO THE RIGHT. THEY ALSO SUSPECT A LEAK IN THE RIGHT IN THAT THEY FEEL THEY ARE SMALLER ON THE SIDE. THEY ARE NOW TAKEN TO THE OPERATING ROOM FOR SUBSEQUENT REPLACEMENT OF BILATERAL IMPLANTS. PROCEDURE: AFTER ADMINISTRATION OF GENERAL ENDOTRACHEAL ANESTHESIA, THE PT WAS PREPPED AND DRAPED IN A STERILE FASHION. SUBSEQUENTLY A #15 BLADE WAS UTILIZED TO EXCISE THE PREVIOUS INFRAMAMMARY SCAR. BOVIE CAUTERIZATION WAS UTILIZED TO DISSECT THROUGH THE UNDERLYING BREAST IMPLANT CAPSULE. HERE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE BREAST IMPLANT WAS TOTALLY FLAT AND WAS REMOVED FROM ITS POCKET. THE CAPSULE WAS EXAMINED AND FOUND TO STILL TO RETAIN MOST OF ITS BASE. PT WAS NOTED TO HAVE AN INFRAMAMMARY CREASE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER BY AT LEAST 2CM ON THE LEFT AS COMPARED TO THE RIGHT. AN INFERIOR CAPSULOTOMY WAS PERFORMED AFTER REFLECTION OF THE BREAST CAPSULE EXTENDING FROM APPROX THE THREE O'CLOCK POSITION OF THE LATERAL CAPSULE TO THE NINE O'CLOCK POSITION OF THE MEDIAL CAPSULE. HEMOSTASIS WAS ACHIEVED WITH BOVIE CAUTERIZATION. AFTER COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF NORMAL SALINE WAS UTILIZED TO IRRIGATE THE POCKET, A 350CC IMPLANT WAS BROUGHT INTO THE FIELD, EVACUATED OF ALL AIR AND FILLED WITH 120CC OF SALINE. SUBSEQUENTLY THIS WAS THEN PLACED INTO THE POCKET AND THEN OVERFILLED TO MFR'S SPECIFICATIONS OF 400CC. AFTER REMOVING THE ANTERIOR FILL APPARATUS AND REPLACING THE PLUG, THE IMPLANT WAS APPROPRIATELY POSITIONED IN THE CAPSULE. PREPLACED 3-0 VICRYL SUTURES WERE THEN TIED DOWN THROUGH THE CAPSULAR PORTION OF THE ORIGINAL INCISION AND BURIED INTERRUPTED 4-0 PDS SUTURE WAS UTILIZED FOR COAPTATION OF DERMAL SKIN EDGES. ATTENTION WAS THEN TURNED TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE WHERE AGAIN THE PREVIOUS SCAR WAS EXCISED AND THEN BOVIE CAUTERIZATION UTILIZED TO DIVIDE DOWN AND THROUGH THE UNDERLYING IMPLANT CAPSULE. HERE THEN THE IMPLANT WAS REMOVED FROM ITS POCKET. IT APPEARED TO BE INTACT AS BEST COULD BE DETERMINED. BOTH IMPLANTS WERE APPROPRIATELY PACKAGED TO BE RETURNED TO MENTOR. AFTER EXAMINING THE CAPSULE, COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF NORMAL SALINE WAS UTILIZED TO IRRIGATE THE POCKET. A SECOND 350CC IMPLANT WAS BROUGHT TO THE FIELD, SUBSEQUENTLY FILLED WITH 120CC SALINE AND EVACUATED OF ALL AIR. AFTER PREPLACING AGAIN 3-0 VICRYL THROUGH THE INFERIOR CAPSULAR INCISION, THE IMPLANT WAS THEN PLACED INTO THE POCKET AND OVERFILLED TO MFR'S SPECIFICATIONS OF 400CC SALINE SOLUTION. THE ANTERIOR FILL APPARATUS WAS REMOVED AND THE PLUG REPLACED. AFTER POSITIONING THE IMPLANT, IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE CAPSULE EXTENDED MUCH FARTHER LATERALLY I.E. TO THE MID-AXILLARY LINE AS COMPARED TO THE RIGHT SIDE WHICH EXTENDED ONLY TO THE ______-AXILLARY LINE. SUBSEQUENTLY THIS ALSO CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT ABNORMAL CONCAVITY AS THE IMPLANT PULLED AWAY FROM ITS MEDIAL CAPSULE REFLECTION CAUSING A TELLTALE CONCAVITY IN THIS AREA. THE IMPLANT SUBSEQUENTLY WAS REMOVED FROM THE POCKET AND A CAPSULOPLASTY PERFORMED LATERALLY BY UTILIZING A SPINAL NEEDLE AS WELL AS BRILLIANT GREEN TO MARK THE APPROX NEW REFLECTIONS SYMMETRIC WITH THE OPPOSITE SIDE THROUGH THE ENTIRE BREAST AFTER THIS WAS MARKED APPROPRIATELY. A CAPSULOTOMY THEN WAS PERFORMED LATERALLY ACROSS THIS PRE-MARKED AREA ALONG THE LATERAL ASPECT OF THE CAPSULE DOME AS WELL AS ALONG THE CHEST WALL. THE CAPSULOPLASTY WAS THEN PERFORMED WITH RUNNING 2-0 VICRYL SUTURE, SUTURING THE MOST MEDIAL EDGES OF THE CAPSULOTOMIES TOGETHER. AFTER THIS WAS SECURELY IN PLACE, THE IMPLANT WAS BROUGHT INTO THE FIELD AND PLACED BACK INTO THE POCKET WHERE THEN IT APPEARED TO BE MUCH MORE SYMMETRIC WITH THE OPPOSITE SIDE IN TERMS OF ITS POSITION. AGAIN THE PREPLACED 3-0 VICRYL SUTURES WERE THEN TIED DOWN ALONG THE INFERIOR CAPSULAR INCISION. INVERTED INTERRUPTED 4-0 PDS SUTURE WAS UTILIZED FOR COAPTATION OF DERMAL SKIN EDGES. AFTER TREATING THIS SKIN WITH USE OF BENZOIN, 1/2"" STERI-STRIPS WERE APPLIED LONGITUDINALLY FOR COAPTATION OF EPIDERMIS. A CIRCUMTHORACIC DRESSING WAS APPLIED CONSISTING OF MULTIPLE FLUFFS ANTERIORLY ABOUT BOTH BREASTS, SECURED WITH THE USE OF A PIZZA BOARD WITH TWO WRAPS OF KERLIX ROLL AS WELL AS TWO 6"" ACE WRAPS SECURED ANTERIORLY WITH 2"" WIDE SILK TAPE. THE PT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY EXTUBATED AND TAKEN TO THE RECOVERY ROOM. FINAL SPONGE AND NEEDLE COUNTS WERE CORRECT. TOTAL TIME OF OPERATION WAS APPROX ONE HOUR AND TEN MINUTES. THE TOTAL BLOOD LOSS WAS APPROX 25CC. THE PT WAS IN THE OPERATING ROOM FOR LESS THAN ONE AND ONE-HALF HOURS."|UNK|UNK|09/08/2000|V||UNKNOWN|Y||285491.0||FWM|1.0||SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS|Y|UNK|UNK||UNK|*|UNK|||||UNK|UNK|True

WHEN PT GOT THE PAPERWORK TO SIGN WITH NUMEROUS OTHER WARNINGS ON IT PT ASKED QUESTIONS AND WAS ASSURED THAT THOSE WERE ONLY BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE SILICONE -- NOT SALINE.

I DON'T KNOW HOW OFTEN THESE KINDS OF HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE CAUSED BY BREAST IMPLANTS IN OTHERS, BUT GUESS WHAT, NEITHER DOES ANYONE IN THIS ROOM. THE REASON WE DON'T KNOW, IS BECAUSE THE STUDIES HAVE ASKED THE WRONG QUESTIONS. I DON'T THINK THIS IS COINCIDENTAL. I THINK WHEN IMPLANT COMPANIES AND PLASTIC SURGEONS PAY FOR OR CONDUCT STUDIES ON BREAST IMPLANTS, THEY ASK QUESTIONS WHICH MAKE IMPLANTS SEEM SAFE. I'M HERE TO SAY IT IS TIME TO FIND OUT WHAT THE REAL RISKS ARE OF BREAST IMPLANTS, INCLUDING SALINE AND SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS. MEANWHILE, EVEN IF DOCTORS THINK THE KINDS OF PROBLEMS I HAD ARE RARE, IT SHOULD BE MANDATORY FOR DOCTORS TO DISCLOSE TO POTENTIAL PTS THAT SOME WOMEN GET VERY SICK FROM THEIR IMPLANTS. WHY ISN'T THERE A WARNING LABEL ON BREAST IMPLANTS LIKE THERE ARE ON MOST EVERY OTHER DRUG OR MEDICAL PROCEDURE/SURGERY OUT THERE? I KNOW THE TRUTH, BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE AND ALSO BECAUSE I HAVE TALKED TO MANY OTHER WOMEN WITH SIMILAR EXPERIENCES WITH THEIR IMPLANTS. IT IS TIME FOR THE FDA TO REQUIRE STUDIES OF WOMEN WHO ARE SICK FROM THEIR IMPLANTS TO SEE IF THEY RECOVER WHEN THEIR IMPLANTS ARE REMOVED. ONCE I FIGURED OUT MY IMPLANTS WERE THE CAUSE OF MY SICKNESS, I JOINED A COUPLE OF ONLINE FORUMS TO SEEK OTHER WOMEN WHO WERE EXPERIENCING THE SAME THING. IT WAS AMAZING HOW MANY WOMEN ALL HAD SIMILAR REACTIONS AND HEALTH PROBLEMS -- (B)(6). THERE ARE A LOT OF US OUT THERE. MANY OF THESE WOMEN WEREN'T AS LUCKY AS I WAS, BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T AFFORD TO GET THEIR IMPLANTS REMOVED. INSTEAD, THESE LADIES ARE GETTING SICKER AND SICKER. SOME HAVE DIED, SOME HAVE ORGANS SHUTTING DOWN, MAKING THEM TOO SICK FOR SURGERY. AND SOME HAVE COMMITTED SUICIDE. I WONDER HOW MANY WOMEN HAVE COMMITTED SUICIDE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THEM AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO GET BETTER. ALMOST ALL THE WOMEN HAD SIMILAR STORIES WITH THEIR PLASTIC SURGEON DENYING BREAST IMPLANTS CAUSE SUCH PROBLEMS. THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY SO MANY WOMEN GOT SICKER AND SICKER, GOING TO DR AFTER DR TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS WRONG SINCE THEY WERE TOLD IMPLANTS WERE NOT THE CAUSE OF THEIR SYMPTOMS. I AM ASKING YOU TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, SO THAT OTHER WOMEN WON'T GO THROUGH THIS. THERE ARE DOCTORS WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO HELP THEIR IMPLANT PTS SO THEY FEED THEM ANTIDEPRESSANTS. EVEN IF WOMEN ARE TOLD THEIR IMPLANTS WILL NOT LAST A LIFETIME, THEY DON'T REALIZE THIS MEANS MANY IMPLANTS LAST ONLY 10 YEARS. AND MAMMOGRAPHY TECHS HAVE TOLD ME THEY ARE TOLD IMPLANTS ONLY LAST 5 - 6 YEARS. I PLEAD WITH YOU TO NOT IGNORE THIS GROWING EPIDEMIC OF WOMEN WITH AGING IMPLANTS AND SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS. NOT EVERYONE GETS SICK, BUT THOSE OF US WHO DO PAY DEARLY. PLEASE USE MY EXAMPLE TO ADVISE THE FDA THEY SHOULD NOT BE USING SALINE IMPLANT PTS AS A ""CONTROL GROUP"" TO STUDY THE RISKS OF SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LOCAL COMPLICATIONS ARE SIMILAR FOR ALL BREAST IMPLANTS, AND EVEN THE AUTOIMMUNE SYMPTOMS CAN BE SIMILAR. STUDIES COMPARING SILICONE PTS TO SALINE PTS MIGHT CONCLUDE THEY DON'T DIFFER, BUT IT DOES NOT MEAN EITHER TYPE OF IMPLANT IS SAFE. STUDIES SHOULD COMPARE IMPLANT PTS TO WOMEN WHO DO NOT HAVE IMPLANTS, TO FIND OUT HOW MANY ARE LIKELY TO BE SERIOUSLY HARMED AFTER 5 YEARS, 10 YEARS, OR 20 YEARS. WHAT IS TRULY SAD IS I HAVE HAD SEVERAL WOMEN CONTACT ME SINCE JUNE OF THIS YEAR WHO ARE EXTREMELY SICK FROM THEIR SILICONE AND SALINE IMPLANTS...

1998794|20917661|D|1||I HAVE SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS AFTER HAVING RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY FOLLOWING A BREAST CANCER BILATERAL MASTECTOMY. AT THE END OF (B)(6) 2010, I VISITED (B)(6). THE WEATHER WAS EXTREMELY COLD, -16 DEGREES IN THE EVENINGS. AS THE DRIVE INTO THE MOUNTAINS CLIMBED IN ELEVATION FROM (B)(6), I BEGAN TO HAVE SHALLOW BREATHING. I REMAINED CLAM AND KEPT MY BREATHING SLOW TO AVOID PANIC. WHEN I GOT OUT OF THE CAR, MY MOVEMENTS WERE EXTREMELY SLOW AND RESTRICTED. I FELT IT NECESSARY TO PAY ATTENTION TO MY BREATH, THE SHALLOWNESS WAS VERY PRESENT WITH HEAVINESS IN MY CHEST, AND I COULD NOT FILL MY LUNGS AS I NORMALLY COULD. THROUGHOUT THE NEXT TWO DAYS, I WAS RESTRICTED IN MOVEMENT IN THAT I COULD NOT BREATHE TO COMPLETE NORMAL DAILY TASKS. WALKING ACROSS THE ROOM CAUSED ME TO STOP AND CATCH MY BREATH. MY FAMILY AND I TREATED THIS SYMPTOM AS ALTITUDE SICKNESS. I HAVE NEVER HAD ALTITUDE SICKNESS WITH ANY PRIOR VISITS TO (B)(6). MY LAST VISIT WAS (B)(6) 2010 WITH NO SYMPTOMS WHAT SO EVER. I CONTEMPLATED, MANY TIMES, IF I SHOULD GO TO THE ER BUT KEPT FAITH IN THAT IT WOULD SUBSIDE BY DRINKING WATER AS IF IT REALLY WERE ALTITUDE SICKNESS. AS INTENSE HEADACHE DEVELOPED THAT ENVELOPED MY ENTIRE CRANIUM. I DO NOT HAVE ISSUES WITH HEADACHES, CERTAINLY NOT ONE THIS INTENSE. I FELT HANDICAPPED. I AM NOT HANDICAPPED. I AM A NORMALLY FUNCTIONING HEALTHY CAPABLE WOMAN WHOSE BREATH WAS COMPROMISED BY PRESSURE IN THE CHEST. MY IMPLANTS WERE TIGHTER THAN NORMAL, LARGER AS IF THEY WERE SWOLLEN. ON THE DRIVE BACK TO (B)(6), THERE WAS A POINT WHERE MY BREATH RETURNED TO NORMAL. IT WAS ABOUT THE SAME AREA WHERE IT WAS SHORTENED ON THE WAY UP. TO SAY I WAS RELIEVED I COULD BREATHE NORMALLY AGAIN IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. A SHORT WHILE LATER, I NOTICED A LOUD SLOSHING SOUND IN MY IMPLANTS. THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED SINCE THEY WERE PUT IN (B)(6) 2007. THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT WOULD RESULT IN A LOUD PROMINENT SLOSHING SOUND THAT COULD BE HEARD BY OTHERS IN THE ROOM. THEIR FORM REMAINED NORMAL. I COULDN'T TELL IF THE NOISE WAS COMING FROM INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF THE IMPLANT. THE SKIN AROUND THE IMPLANT SEEMED NORMAL AS WELL. I WAS UP ALL NIGHT EVALUATING IF THEY WERE LEAKING OR NOT. I FOUND IT ODD THAT THEY WOULD BOTH LEAK BUT THE NOISES CAME EQUALLY FROM BOTH SIDES. WITHIN A 24 HOUR TIME SPAN, THE NOISES WERE JUST ABOUT GONE. THERE ISN'T A DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT MY IMPLANTS REACTED TO THE INTENSE COLD AND THE ELEVATION OF THE AREA I VISITED. I CANNOT RETURN TO (B)(6) IN FEAR THIS WILL HAPPEN AGAIN.

THE PT WAS RE-IMPLANTED AT THAT TIME WITH MENTOR SALINE-FILLED MAMMARY PROSTHESES. SHE HAS ALSO PRESENTED WITH A RIGHT DEFLATION. SINCE REMOVING THESE DEVICES, THE PT'S SYMPTOMS HAVE SUBSIDED AND THE PT CAN WALK. BECAUSE THE LEFT PROSTHESIS INVOLVED IN THIS COMPLAINT WILL NOT BE RETURNED TO MENTOR, PE WAS PRECLUDED FROM EVALUATING THE DEVICE. BASED ON THE LABORATORY EVAL, PE CONCLUDED THE RIGHT DEFLATION WAS MOST LIKELY DUE TO THE RENT THAT MEASURED APPROX .1 CM IN LENGTH, WITHIN THE CREASE, ON THE POSTERIOR ASPECT OF THE DEVICE. A MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION OF THE EDGES OF THE RENT REVEALED A TAPERED WEAR PATTERN. TAPER WEAR IS CHARACTERISTIC OF A CREASE/FOLD FAILURE. A CREASE/FOLD FAILURE IS A KNOWN INHERENT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF SALINE-FILLED MAMMARY PROSTHESES AND MAY BE THE RESULT OF ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: UNDERINFLATION OR OVERINFLATION OF THE DEVICE, CONTINUOUS AND SUSTAINED STRESSES TO THE DEVICE - SUCH AS CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR TOO SMALL A BREAST POCKET, AND FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE SHELL IN THE BREAST POCKET. LEAK TESTING OF THE DEVICE REVEALED NO OTHER LEAKAGE SITES.

FOR 20 YEARS, I HAVE EXPERIENCED NUMEROUS AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS AND OTHER HEALTH ISSUES WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN (I ALWAYS ASK MY DOCTORS IF IT COULD BE CAUSED FROM MY SILICONE IMPLANTS AND THEY ALWAYS SAID IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE). I HAVE BEEN ON DISABILITY FOR FIBROMYALGIA FOR SEVERAL YEARS. I AM SCHEDULED TO HAVE THESE TOXIC IMPLANTS REMOVED BUT IT WILL COST ME ALMOST(B)(6) WITH NO INSURANCE HELP. I ORIGINALLY MADE THE DECISION TO HAVE IMPLANTS BECAUSE FDA AND MY DOCTORS SAID THEY WERE TOTALLY SAFE. I HAVE NEVER SMOKED (NOT EVEN ONE PUFF). I EAT MY GARDEN RAISED WHOLE FOODS (I AM (B)(6)), AND I TAKE NO MEDS AND HAVE NEVER DONE ANY DRUGS. PEOPLE SMOKE AND OVER EAT KNOWING THEY RISK HEART DISEASE, DIABETES, CANCER, ETC., AND INSURANCE STILL PAYS FOR THEIR TREATMENT. I AM NOW HAVING TO USE ALL THE MONEY I HAVE SAVED AND ARE SELLING FAMILY HEIRLOOMS TO PAY FOR THE TREATMENT I MUST HAVE, BECAUSE I TRUSTED THE FDA. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE FDA RECOMMENDS REMOVING LEAKING SILICONE IMPLANTS IF THERE IS NO HEALTH PROBLEMS FROM SILICONE IMPLANTS! I HAVE ALWAYS STRONGLY SUPPORTED MY WONDERFUL GOVERNMENT AND MY HEART IS BROKEN THAT I HAVE BEEN WRONG. THE RESEARCH YOU AND OTHERS HAVE DONE ARE SO LIMITED AND FLAWED. YOU HAVE CONVINCED DOCTORS THAT IMPLANT RELATED HEALTH ISSUES ARE NOT A PROBLEM AND SO THEREFORE WHEN WOMEN LIKE ME TRY TO GET OUR DOCTORS TO INVESTIGATE THE POSSIBILITY, WE ARE DISMISSED AND TOLD OUR SYMPTOMS ARE EITHER ""IN OUR HEADS"" OR ARE CAUSED BY A VIRUS OR STRESS SO WE SHOULD JUST GO HOME AND RELAX. THE LOSS OF CONFIDENCE AND TRUST IN MY GOVERNMENT IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE WORST PROBLEM WITH THIS ISSUE. I AM SO SAD AND DEPRESSED. I DO UNDERSTAND WHY THERE IS SUCH A HIGH DEGREE OF SUICIDE BY WOMEN WITH IMPLANT PROBLEMS. MY QUALITY OF LIFE IS AT ROCK BOTTOM AFTER 30 YEARS OF TEACHING SECONDARY EDUCATION IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM AND LOOKING FORWARD TO MY RETIREMENT YEARS. ALL MY RESOURCES WILL NOW HAVE TO BE USED TO PAY DOCTORS AND I JUST PRAY THAT THEY DO NOT FIND ALCL. I JUST READ THAT INSURANCE WILL NOT PAY FOR THAT CANCER TREATMENT EITHER AND SO IF I HAVE IT, I WILL JUST NOT BE ABLE TO GET TREATMENT. THIS IS JUST WRONG THAT MY GOVERNMENT ALLOWS THIS TO HAPPEN TO WOMEN WHO HAD IMPLANTS DURING A TIME THAT WE WERE TOLD THEY WERE TOTALLY SAFE. IN 1990, I DID THE RESEARCH AND I BELIEVED YOU (FDA) THAT I WAS MAKING A SAFE DECISION. I JUST WANTED MY HUSBAND TO BE PROUD OF ME. SO SAD AND HEART BROKEN, WHAT IS THE TEST FOR THAT!! EVEN THOUGH I PAY MONTHLY INSURANCE PREMIUMS, THEY WOULDN'T PAY FOR THAT EITHER."|REPLICON SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT||08/28/2014|||||||0|FTR|1.0||SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT|||||||SURGITEK|||||NOT KNOWN||True

I HAVE TO HAVE SURGERY TO REMOVE IT AND I DO HAVE A WARRANTY TO HAVE IT REPLACED FREE OF CHARGE BUT JUST THE THOUGHTS OF GOING THROUGH THIS AGAIN BECAUSE OF A FAULTY IMPLANT. WOKE UP ONE MORNING THIS APRIL AND SAW MY RIGHT BREAST FELT SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN THE LEFT WHEN SHOWERING. NEXT DAY IT WAS SMALLER AND I HAD TO WAIT UNTIL MONDAY AS IT WAS A ""BAT"" TO REACH MY SURGEON AS IT WAS THE WEEKEND. I KNEW RIGHT AWAY THAT MY IMPLANT HAD LEAKED. MY SURGEON TOLD ME WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IF IT LEAKED. MY SURGEON TOLD ME WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IF IT EVER HAPPENED BEFORE MY FIRST SURGERY I HAD BY HIM ABOUT 1995. I GOT A SECOND SET OF IMPLANTS AFTER 15 YEARS AS I HAD WENT ON A LIGHT DIET AND HAPPILY LOST 25 LBS SO MY 1ST SET OF IMPLANTS SEEMED SAGGY AND TIME TO REPLACE, ONLY FOR COSMETIC REASONS. MY DOCTOR/SURGEON DID EXCELLENT JOB. SO (B)(6) 2014, I HAD 1ST SET REMOVED AND WAS EXCITED TO HAVE MY 2ND SET IMPLANTED, EXPECTING TO NEVER HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS PAIN AGAIN. SURE ENOUGH I HAD DISCOVERED THE LEAK AND MADE AN APPT WITH MY DOCTOR LAST WEEK AND HE DIAGNOSED IT AS A RUPTURED/DEFECTIVE IMPLANT. I AM GIVEN THE OPTION OF HAVING BOTH REMOVED, AND STITCHED BACK UP AND RECOVER, OR REPLACE ONE OR BOTH IMPLANTS (UNDER WARRANTY). I CHOSE AND IT'S ALMOST IF YOU WANT TO LOOK NORMAL YOU MUST REPLACE THEM AS YOUR SKIN HAS GOTTEN SO STRETCHED OUT. SO I HAVE A SURGERY DATE OF (B)(6) 2014. I HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THIS PAIN FROM HAVING NOT ONE, BUT BOTH IMPLANTS REPLACED SO I DO NOT LOOK DISFIGURED. IF I CHOSE TO HAVE THEM REMOVED, I WOULD STILL NEED SOME TYPE OF COSMETIC WORK ON BOTH BREASTS AS THEY WOULD SAG AND LOOK TERRIBLE. EITHER WAY, BECAUSE OF A DEFECTIVE IMPLANT I HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS ALL OVER AGAIN WHEN I THOUGHT I WAS DONE. NOT THE SURGEON'S FAULT.

I CALLED MY PMD AGAIN AND ASKED FOR AN MRI (FOR A 5TH TIME). FINALLY SAID THEY'D REFER FOR AN APPROVAL. I JUST GOT MY MRI ON (B)(6) 2016 AND AM AWAITING THE RESULTS TO SEE IF THERE IS A LEAK OR TEAR. I KNOW THAT THE MEDICAL FIELD DOESN'T ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SILICONE IMPLANTS (OR ANY IMPLANTS) CAN CAUSE SOMEONE TO HAVE AUTO IMMUNE LIKE SYMPTOMS. BUT THE SILICONE IMPLANTS ARE THE ONLY THING THAT HAVE CHANGED IN THE PAST 2 YEARS OF MY LIFE AND MY FAMILY HAS NO HISTORY OF AUTO IMMUNE LIKE ILLNESS. I NOTICED WHEN I TAKE CHLORELLA, IT DRAMATICALLY HELPS BECAUSE THE PAIN, DIZZINESS ETC. I DO BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE'S BODY IS DIFFERENT AND DOESN'T REACT THE SAME, AT THIS POINT I AM CERTAIN MY SYMPTOMS ARE DUE TO MY SILICONE IMPLANTS, RUPTURE OR NOT.
