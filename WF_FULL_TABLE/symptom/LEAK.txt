DEFLATION Â¿ BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS DEFLATE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. DEFLATION CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO DEFLATE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS; FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL; EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED); TRAUMA; COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING; AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE.

CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE.

SEVENTEEN OF THESE PATIENTS WERE IMPLANTED WITH TISSUE EXPANDERS AND REVISION SURGERY OCCURRED TO EXCHANGE THEM WITH ""PERMANENT IMPLANTS."" ONE OF THESE PATIENTS UNDERWENT DIRECT-TO-IMPLANT RECONSTRUCTION FOLLOWING MASTECTOMY, IN WHICH IT IS UNKNOWN WHETHER ANY REVISION OCCURRED. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW IF THIS PATIENT AFFECTED BY Â¿SKIN ISCHEMIC CHANGESÂ¿ THAT RESULTED IN DEVELOPMENT OF Â¿PARTIAL NIPPLE NECROSISÂ¿ WAS THE AFOREMENTIONED DIRECT-TO-IMPLANT RECONSTRUCTION. ARTICLE CITATION: Â¿EVALUATING LONG-TERM OUTCOMES FOLLOWING NIPPLE-SPARING MASTECTOMY AND RECONSTRUCTION IN THE IRRADIATED BREAST,Â¿ BY SCOTT L. SPEAR, M.D., JOHN SHUCK, M.D., LINDSAY HANNAN, M.D., M.S.P.H., FRANK ALBINO, M.D., AND KETAN M. PATEL, M.D., PUBLISHED IN PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY, VOL. 133, NO.5., MAY 2014, PP. 605E-614E. THE EVENTS OF ISCHEMIA AND NECROSIS ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS, AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THESE EVENTS. FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTER REGARDING THE EVENT, PRODUCT, AND/OR PATIENT DETAILS WAS REQUESTED. NO FURTHER FOLLOW UP IS POSSIBLE, AS THE CORRESPONDING AUTHOR IS DECEASED. DEVICE LABELING: THE STRESSES OF THE EXPANDING DEVICE MAY INDUCE PRESSURE ISCHEMIA AND NECROSIS, ESPECIALLY IN TIGHT OR THIN-SKINNED AREAS. FOLDS IN A PARTIALLY FILLED TISSUE EXPANDER MAY ALSO RESULT IN THINNING AND EROSION OF ADJACENT TISSUE. EXCESSIVELY RAPID TISSUE EXPANSION MAY COMPROMISE THE VASCULARITY OF THE OVERLYING TISSUE. AS EXPECTED FOLLOWING ANY INVASIVE SURGICAL PROCEDURE, PAIN OF VARYING INTENSITY AND DURATION MAY OCCUR FOLLOWING TISSUE EXPANDER PLACEMENT. IN ADDITION, THE EXPANSION PROCESS MAY CAUSE SOME DISCOMFORT, BUT SHOULD NOT CAUSE EXCESSIVE PAIN. PAIN MAY INDICATE EXPANSION BEYOND TISSUE TOLERANCE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN ISCHEMIA AND NECROSIS. PAIN MAY ALSO ACCOMPANY OTHER ADVERSE REACTIONS. UNEXPLAINED PAIN MUST BE PROMPTLY INVESTIGATED. FURTHER EXPANSION SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED UNTIL THE PAIN IS RESOLVED. ACTIVE INFECTION ANYWHERE IN THE BODY MAY INCREASE RISK OF PERIPROSTHETIC INFECTION. DO NOT EXPOSE THE TISSUE EXPANDER OR INJECTION NEEDLES TO CONTAMINANTS, WHICH INCREASE THE RISK OF INFECTION. PATIENTS WHO PRESENT WOUND DEHISCENCE, TISSUE EROSION, ISCHEMIA OR NECROSIS RUN AN INCREASED RISK OF PERIPROSTHETIC INFECTION. MEASURES TO PROTECT SUCH AREAS FROM INFECTION SHOULD BE TAKEN. THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY. THE RISKS INCLUDE: IMPLANT DEFLATION/LEAKAGE, ADDITIONAL SURGERY, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, INFECTION, TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME, NECROSIS, HEMATOMA, SEROMA, EXTRUSION, BREAST PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE SENSATION, CHANGES IN BREAST SENSATION, DISSATISFACTION WITH COSMETIC RESULTS (WRINKLING, FOLDING, DISPLACEMENT, ASYMMETRY, PALPABILITY, VISIBILITY, PTOSIS, SLOSHING), CALCIFIC DEPOSITS, IRRITATION/INFLAMMATION, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, HYPERTROPHIC SCARRING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, DIFFICULTY/INABILITY IN BREAST FEEDING, AND INABILITY TO ADEQUATELY VISUALIZE BREAST LESIONS WITH MAMMOGRAPHY.

THE PHYSICIAN ONLY CONFIRMED CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. THE EVENT OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS A PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATION AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THIS EVENT. FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTER REGARDING EVENT, PRODUCT, OR PATIENT DETAILS HAS BEEN REQUESTED. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. DEVICE LABELING: UNDERGOING ANY TYPE OF SURGERY INVOLVES RISKS. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF LOCAL COMPLICATIONS (PROBLEMS AT OR NEAR THE BREAST/SURGICAL INCISION SITE) THAT MAY OCCUR AFTER YOUR BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY. THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS PRESENT RESULTS FROM ALLERGANÂ¿S CORE CLINICAL STUDY CONDUCTED ON NATRELLE Â® SILICONE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANTS. ONE OF THE KEY COMPLICATIONS REPORTED IS CALLED Â¿CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE.Â¿ CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS A TIGHTENING OF THE SCAR TISSUE (ALSO CALLED A CAPSULE) THAT NORMALLY FORMS AROUND THE BREAST IMPLANT DURING THE HEALING PROCESS AFTER SURGERY. IN SOME WOMEN, THE SCAR TISSUE (CAPSULE) SQUEEZES THE IMPLANT. THIS RESULTS IN FIRMNESS OR HARDENING OF THE BREAST, AND IT IS A RISK FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE. DEGREES OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE ARE CLASSIFIED BY THE BAKER GRADING SCALE.1 CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BAKER GRADES III AND IV ARE THE MOST SEVERE. BAKER GRADE III OFTEN RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SURGERY (REOPERATION) BECAUSE OF PAIN AND POSSIBLY ABNORMAL APPEARANCE. BAKER GRADE IV USUALLY RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR REOPERATION BECAUSE OF PAIN AND UNACCEPTABLE APPEARANCE. OTHER REASONS FOR REOPERATIONS ARE DISCUSSED IN THE ONLINE PATIENT LABELING IN SECTION 5.5 ALLERGANÂ¿S CLINICAL STUDY RESULTS: WHAT ARE THE MAIN REASONS FOR REOPERATION? GLOSSARY: CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE - A TIGHTENING OF THE SCAR TISSUE (ALSO CALLED A CAPSULE) THAT NORMALLY FORMS AROUND THE BREAST IMPLANT DURING THE HEALING PROCESS AFTER SURGERY. IN SOME WOMEN, THE SCAR TISSUE (CAPSULE) SQUEEZES THE IMPLANT. WHEN THIS OCCURS, IT IS CALLED CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. THIS RESULTS IN FIRMNESS OR HARDENING OF THE BREAST, AND IS A RISK FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS CLASSIFIED BY BAKER GRADES. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BAKER GRADES III AND IV ARE THE MOST SEVERE. BAKER GRADE III OFTEN RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SURGERY (REOPERATION) BECAUSE OF PAIN AND POSSIBLY ABNORMAL APPEARANCE. BAKER GRADE IV USUALLY RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SURGERY (REOPERATION) BECAUSE OF PAIN AND UNACCEPTABLE APPEARANCE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BAKER GRADE II MAY ALSO RESULT IN THE NEED FOR SURGERY. EACH GRADE IS DESCRIBED BELOW. BAKER GRADE I Â¿ NORMALLY SOFT AND NATURAL APPEARANCE. BAKER GRADE II Â¿ A LITTLE FIRM, BUT BREAST LOOKS NORMAL. BAKER GRADE III Â¿ MORE FIRM THAN NORMAL, AND MAY LOOK ABNORMAL (CHANGE IN SHAPE). BAKER GRADE IV Â¿ HARD, OBVIOUS DISTORTION, AND RUPTURE - A HOLE OR TEAR IN THE SHELL OF THE IMPLANT THAT ALLOWS SILICONE GEL FILLER MATERIAL TO LEAK FROM THE SHELL. RUPTURES CAN BE INTRACAPSULAR (INSIDE THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT) OR EXTRACAPSULAR (OUTSIDE THE SCAR TISSUE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT). WARNINGS: RUPTURE OF A SILICONE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT IS MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR SURGEON WILL KNOW THAT YOUR IMPLANTS HAVE A RUPTURE. THEREFORE YOU WILL NEED REGULAR MRI SCREENINGS OVER YOUR LIFETIME IN ORDER TO DETERMINE IF RUPTURE IS PRESENT. YOU SHOULD HAVE AN MRI 3 YEARS AFTER YOUR BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY AND THEN EVERY 2 YEARS AFTER THAT FOR AS LONG AS YOU HAVE YOUR BREAST IMPLANTS. IF IMPLANT RUPTURE IS NOTED ON AN MRI, YOU SHOULD HAVE THE IMPLANT REMOVED, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT.|STYLE 45 SILICONE GEL FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|45-550|07/27/2017||||N|R||0HP|FTR|1.0|04/22/2011|PROSTHESIS, BREAST, NONINFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SILICONE GEL-FILLED||1266902|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

WHITE PARTICLE MATERIAL WAS NOTED ON THE OUTER SURFACE OF THE DEVICE. A LEAK TEST WAS PERFORMED AND NO LEAKS WERE NOTED. NO BLOCKAGE WAS NOTED IN THE PORT HOLE OF THE DIAPHRAGM VALVE. THE DEVICE WAS NOTED AS INTACT AND FUNCTIONAL. A REVIEW OF THE DEVICE HISTORY RECORD HAS BEEN INITIATED AND COMPLETED; DHR COMPLETED AND NO DEVIATIONS/NON-CONFORMANCES FOUND. FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE REPORTER REGARDING EVENT, PRODUCT, OR PATIENT DETAILS HAS BEEN REQUESTED. NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, ASYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. DEFLATION Â¿ BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS DEFLATE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. DEFLATION CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO DEFLATE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS; FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL; EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED); TRAUMA; COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING; AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF DEFLATION FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT; HOWEVER, IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF DEFLATION. UNSATISFACTORY RESULTS Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE INFORMED THAT DISSATISFACTION WITH COSMETIC RESULTS RELATED TO SUCH THINGS AS SCAR DEFORMITY, HYPERTROPHIC SCARRING, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, INCORRECT SIZE, AND IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY MAY OCCUR. CAREFUL SURGICAL PLANNING AND TECHNIQUE CAN MINIMIZE, BUT NOT PRECLUDE, THE RISK OF SUCH RESULTS. PRE-EXISTING ASYMMETRY MAY NOT BE ENTIRELY CORRECTABLE. REVISION SURGERY MAY BE INDICATED TO MAINTAIN PATIENT SATISFACTION BUT CARRIES ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS AND RISKS.|STYLE 68 SALINE FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|68HP-425|07/25/2017||08/28/2013||R|Y||0HP|FWM|1.0|04/30/2016|PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||2295248|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

11618|7262|D|1||RPTR'S PAIN IS LOCATED BELOW THE LEFT BREAST IN THE AREA OF A PREVIOUS BREAST AUGMENTATION SCAR. THE PAIN BEGAN ABOUT 12 YRS AGO, WHICH WAS TWO YRS AFTER BILATERAL BREAST AUGMENTATION SURGERY. THIS PAIN IS INTERMITTENT IN NATURE. SHE WILL GO A COUPLE OF YRS WITHOUT HAVING ANY PAIN AND IT NEVER LASTS MORE THAN 20 MINS. SHE DESCRIBES THE PAIN AS VERY SHARP, LOCATED IN THE AREA OF THIS SCAR AND SOMETIMES SHE NOTICES SOME KIND OF A TINGLING FEELING. THE PAIN INTENSITY IS ANYWHERE FROM A SCALE OF 1-10, SOMETIMES THE PAIN IS SO SEVERE SHE STATES THAT IT BRINGS HER TO HER KNEES. SOMETIMES JUST STIMULATION OF SKIN OVER HER POSTERIOR BACK INCREASES THE PAIN OVER THE SCAR. THE PAIN IS AGGRAVATED BY MOBILITY. ROLLING OVER IN BED AGGRAVATES THE PAIN. WHEN THE PAIN IS PRESENT BREATHING OR COUGHING MAKES THE PAIN WORSE. NO POSITIONS OR HEAT OR COLD HELP THE PAIN. SHE HAS BEEN ON NUMEROUS MEDICATIONS INCLUDING NONSTEROIDALS, MOTRIN AND TOLECTIN, THAT HAVE BEEN NO HELP WHATSOEVER. SHE HAD BEEN ON PAMELOR AND TEGRETOL WHICH ALSO HAVE BEEN NO HELP. THE ONLY MEDICATION THAT HAS GIVEN HER ANY HELP IS HYDROCODONE 5 MG QID. SHE STILL HAS THE PAIN WHILE ON THIS MEDICATION BUT IT SORT OF DULLS THE INTENSITY. HER CURRENT MEDICATIONS INCLUDE LIBRIUM 10 MG TID AND SHE IS ON HORMONE REPLACEMENT. THE PLASTIC SURGEON WHO DID THE INTITIAL SURGERY, HAS BEEN SEEING HER FOR THIS PROBLEM AND HAS INJECTED SCAR NUMEROUS TIMES WITH STEROIDS AND HAS DONE INTERCOSTAL BLOCKS. THE INTERCOASTAL BLOCKS SEEM TO HAVE BEEN INEFFECTIVE IN THAT THERE WAS NO NUMBNESS IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE INTERCOSTAL NERVE. BECAUSE OF HER HEALTH INSURANCE THE PLASTIC SURGEON HAD TO DO THESE BLOCKS BEFORE HE COULD RE-OPERATE ON HER. IN 10/91 HE RE-OPERATED ON HER AND FOUND THAT SHE HAD SILICONE LEAKS FROM THE BREAST IMPLANTS AND CAPSULITIS AND HAD SIGNS OF NERVE ENTRAPMENT. HE FIXED ALL THESE PROBLEMS, CLEARED OUT SCAR TISSUE AND PUT IN NEW BREAST IMPLANTS, THIS TIME BELOW THE PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE. SHE HAD NOTICED THAT THE PAIN HAS BEEN NO DIFFERENT SINCE THIS PARTICULAR OPERATION. AN ANESTHESIOLOGIST DID INTERCOASTAL BLOCK ON 7/22/92. SHE HAD NUMBNESS IN THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE NERVE BLOCKS WHICH WERE T6 THROUGH T9 ON THE LEFT, HOWEVER THE PAIN WAS NOT RELIEVED. THE PT STATES THAT THIS PAIN IS CAUSING HER A LOT OF STRESS. RECENTLY SHE HAS BEEN HAVING INCREASED INCIDENTS OF THESE PAINFUL EPISODES THAT SHE THINKS ARE RELATED TO STRESS. EXAM OF HER CHEST WALL REVEALS THE SCAR IS WELL-HEALED. IT IS VERY FLAT, THERE IS NO TENDERNESS ON PALPATION OF THE SCAR. NO SIGNS OF NEUROMAS. PT NOTES THAT THE PAIN WENT COMPLETELY AWAY FOR 7 MONTHS AFTER A TRIAL OF DILANTIN BUT SHE HAD A REACTION OT THE MEDICATION AND COULD NOT CONTINUE IT. DR WAS UNABLE TO REPRODUCE THE PT'S PAIN WITH DEEP PRESSURE, SUPERFICIAL PRESSURE, STROKING OR BRUSHING. HOWEVER, DR COULD REPRODUCE THE PAIN WITH TENS OVER RPTR'S INTERCOSTAL AREA, BOTH ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR. PHYSICAL THERAPY IMPRESSION IS INTERCOSTAL NEURALGIA.

20211|14895|D|1||BECAUSE OF FIBROCYSTIC DISEASE, RPTR HAD RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY 12/20/76 WITH ANOTHER CO'S IMPLANTS. DUE TO SCAR CONTRACTURE AND TWO UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS AT CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, BOTH IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED AND THE SAME IMPLANTS WERE REINSERTED. IN 1979, THE LEFT IMPLANT WAS REPLACED WITH THIS CO'S DOUBLE LUMEN GEL/SALINE IMPLANT. AFTER EXPLANTATION SURGERY 8/17/94, LAB ANALYSIS REPORT FROM DR WAS OBTAINED EXPLAINING THE PROBLEMS WITH FAILED IMPLANTS. THE DEVICE FROM THE CONTAINER IDENTIFIED AS THE LEFT SIDE WAS EVIDENTLY THE REPLACEMENT FOR A FAILIED IMPLANT FROM THE PREVIOUS SURGERY. IT WAS IDENTIFIED AS A DOUBLE LUMEN CONSISTENT WITH PRODUCTION CIRCA 1977-78. THE CRITERIA OF IDENTIFICATION INCLUDE A LEAF VALVE EXCLUSIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CO'S PRODUCTS. THIS IS NOT A SALINE IMPLANT, IT IS A COMBINATION GEL WITH ADDED SALINE IN A SEPARATE COMPARMENT. THE LEFT IMPLANT HAD PERFORATED INNER AND OUTER SHELLS AND WAS SEVERELY CONTAMINATED BY TISSUE AND POSSIBLY MICRO-ORGANISMS AND THEIR METABOLITES. THE GEL LEAKED PROFUSELY THROUGH MULTIPLE PERFORATIONS. THE GEL WAS ALSO INVASIVE AND OF AN EASILY DISPERSED NATURE. THE LOSS OF GEL PROPERTY (REVERSION FROM A COHESIVE PRODUCT TO AN OIL-LIKE ENTITY) IS A SIGN OF CHEMICAL DEGRADATION. THE CAPSULE RECEIVED IN THE CONTAINER INDICATING THE RIGHT SIDE SHOWS A DISORGANIZED MASS OF TISSUE CONSISTENT WITH SEVERE ADVERSE REACTIONS AND FAILURE OF THE CAPSULE TO CONTAIN THE DEBRIS OF A GROSSLY LEAKING PROSTHESIS. IT ALSO INDICATES MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS AT CLOSED CAPSULOTOMIES AND POSSIBLE INFECTION. NODULAR PORTIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH GRANULOMATOUS MATERIALS FROM A PT WHO RECEIVED MULTIPLE IMPLANTS AND WHERE DEBRIDEMENT OF THE TISSUE (ABLATIVE CAPSULECTOMY) WAS NOT PERFORMED AT THE TIME OF PROSTHESIS REPLACEMENT. THE CAPSULE RECEIVED IN THE CONTAINER INDICATING THE LEFT SIDE WAS EXTENSIVELY CALCIFIED WITH PLAQUE-LIKE ENTITIES. THESE SUGGEST A PROLONGED EXPOSURE TO AGGRESSIVE CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES RESULTING IN NECROSIS AND MINERALIZATION. IT APPEARS MOST PROBLEM THAT THE CAPSULES WERE TRANSPOSED SOME TIME AFTER SURGERY. IN PRINCIPLE, THE CALCIFIED CAPSULE SHOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DOUBLE LUMEN IMPLANT. (ALSO SEE 1005399.)

12046|9795|D|1||IN 1986, RPTR WENT TO SEE HER MD WITH THE PROBLEM OF FIBRO-ADENOSIS. THE OPTION OF BREAST IMPLANTS WAS RECOMMENDED. ANOTHER DR WENT OVER THE PROCEDURE WITH RPTR AND HER HUSBAND AT THAT TIME. HE DESCRIBED THE OPERATION AND THE OUTCOME. THE DR SAID SHE WOULD HAVE A TWO INCH SCAR THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE A STRETCH MARK. HER BREASTS WOULD BE LARGER AND FIRMER. HER FUTURE CHANCES OF CANCER WOULD BY 95% AGAINST CANCER. HER MOTHER HAS HAD A MASTECTOMY, SO THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT ADVANTAGE TO HER. QUESTIONS SHE ASKED INCLUDED, SINCE SHE WAS SPORTS ORIENTED, WOULD THESE IMPLANTS BREAK OR LEAK. SHE WAS TOLD THEY WOULD NOT. SHE ALSO ASSUMED THEY WERE FDA APPROVED. SHE HAD NO IDEA THAT A HOSP WOULD PERFORM A PROCEDURE THAT HAD NOT BEEN APPROVED. AFTER DISCUSSING THE PROCEDURE, AND THE POSSIBILITY OF FUTURE CANCER, SHE CHOOSE THE BREAST IMPLANTS. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE OPERATION SHE HAD PROBLEMS. SHE NO LONGER HAD A SEPARATION BETWEEN THE BREASTS. HER BREASTS WERE AND STILL ARE LUMPY. THEY WERE TWO DIFFERENCT SIZES AND STILL ARE. THE SCARS ARE STILL LARGE AND VERY DARK IN COLOR. SHE ALSO HAS ALOT OF PAIN IN HER RIGHT BREAST. COLLAGEN INJECTIONS WERE INJECTED INTO THE SCARS TO LIGHTEN THEM. THIS DID NOT HELP. A SECOND OPERATION WAS PERFORMED TO ADJUST THE LUMPY MASS AND TO SEPARATE THE BREASTS. THE LUMPS ARE STILL PRESENT. THE ORIGINAL IMPLANTS WERE REPLACED BACK INTO HER FOR A SECOND TIME. SHE LATER FOUND OUT THAT THIS PROCEDURE SAVES MONEY BY USING THE SAME IMPLANTS A SECOND TIME. THE BREASTS ARE SEPARATED NOW. SHE WAS TOLD THE SCARS WOULD FADE AND THE PAIN WOULD DECREASE AND TO BE PATIENT. AFTER MORE VISITS SHE WAS TOLD SHE LOOKED FINE. AGAIN, SHE WAS TOLD THE SCARS WOULD FADE AND THE PAIN WOULD DECREASE. SHE WAS TOLD SHE HAD EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS  AND TO SEEK HELP WITH HER EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS DEALING WITH HER BREAST IMPLANTS. SHE WAS TOLD SHE SHOULD BE GLAD THAT SHE WAS ALIVE. THIS STATEMENT ONLY AGITATED HER MORE. EARLY IN 1991 HER MD SENT HER TO ANOTHER DR WHO DID NOT THINK HER BREASTS LOOKED RIGHT EITHER. THE DR DISCUSSED DIFFERENT IMPLANTS, CORRECTING THE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE AND CORRECTING THE SCARS. SHE COULD NOT AFFORD THE COST OF THIS SURGERY. SHE FELT IT WAS A DETERRENT TO GET RID OF HER. SHE CURRENTLY HAS PAIN IN HER BREASTS. THERE IS ALSO A BLUE COLORED AREA IN ONE BREAST. MUSCLE AND JOINT PAIN FOR NO REASON. LUMPS AND CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE ARE ALSO A PROBLEM, CAUSING THE BREAST TO BE HARD AND ABNORMALLY SHAPED. SHE HAS ALSO HAD TO HAVE LUMPS IN HER FOOT GLAND SURGICALLY REMOVED. HER HANDS AND FEET SWELL FOR NO REASON. UNEXPLAINED FATIGUE PLAQUES HER. SHE WENT FROM A B CUP TO A DEFORMED A CUP. NONE OF THESE PROBLEMS WERE DISCUSSED PRIOR TO SURGERY AND SHE IS TOLD SHE IS FINE.

AT THAT POINT, SHE WAS VERY CONCERNED. THE SURGEON REFERRED HER TO A PLASTIC SURGEON FOR A CONSULTATION IN DECIDING THE NEXT STEP. ON 4/21/95, SHE WAS EXAMINED BY THE PLASTIC SURGEON. HE INFORMED HER OF THE PROBLEMS OF EXTENSIVE SURGERY TO REMOVE POLYURETHANE-COATED IMPLANTS. HE ADVISED RPTR TO HAVE THE IMPLANTS REMOVED UNTIL FURTHER COMPLICATIONS AROSE.

DUE TO SCAR CONTRACTURE AND TWO UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS AT CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, BOTH IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED AND THE SAME IMPLANTS WERE REINSERTED. IN 1979, THE LEFT IMPLANT WAS REPLACED WITH A DOUBLE LUMEN GEL/SALINE IMPLANT. THE FOLLOWING IS FROM A LABORATORY ANALYSIS REPORT AFTER EXPLANTATION: THE IMPLANTS WERE PERFORATED AT MULTIPLE LOCATIONS. THE RECEIVED ORIGINAL RIGHT SIDE IMPLANT HAD A SEVERELY DEGRADED SHELL AS WELL AS PERFORATIONS BUT IT WAS NOT GROSLY RUPTURED. THE LEFT IMPLANT HAD PERFORATED INNER AND OUTER SHELLS AND WAS SEVERELY CONTAMINATED BY TISSUE AND POSSIBLY MICRO-ORGANISMS AND THEIR METABOLITES. THE GEL LEAKED PROFUSELY THROUGH MULTIPLE PERFORATIONS. THE GEL WAS ALSO INVASIVE AND OF AN EASILY DISPERSED NATURE. THE CAPSULE RECEIVED IN THE CONTAINER INDICATING THE RIGHT SIDE SHOWS A DISORGANIZED MASS OF TISSUE CONSISTENT WITH SEVERE ADVERSE REACTION AND FAILURE OF THE CAPSULE TO CONTAIN THE DEBRIS OF A GROSSLY LEAKING PROSTHESIS. IT ALSO INDICATES MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS AT CLOSED CAPSULOTOMIES AND POSSIBLE INFECTION. NODULAR PORTIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH GRANULOMATOUS MATERIAL AND A PT WHO RECEIVED MULTIPLE IMPLANTS AND WHERE DEBRIDEMENT OF THE TISSUE (ABLATIVE CAPSULECTOMY) WAS NOT PERFORMED AT THE TIME OF PROSTHESIS REPLACEMENT. THE CAPSULE RECEIVED IN THE CONTAINER INDICATING THE LEFT SIDE WAS EXTENSIVELY CALCIFIED WITH PLAQUE-LIKE ENTITIES. THESE SUGGEST A PROLONGED EXPOSURE TO AGGRESSIVE CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES RESULTING IN NECROSIS AND MINERALIZATION. OVERALL IMPRESSIONS SUGGEST, A PT WITH MULTIPLE PROSTHETIC MISADVENTURES AND EXTENSIVE TISSUE DAMAGE IN THE PROSTHETIC AREA IN ADDITION TO POSSIBLE METABOLIC DISTURBANCES AND SYSTEMIC EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH ABSORPTION OF MIXED BIOACTIVE SUBSTANCES ORIGINATING FROM FAULTY BREAST PROSTHESES.

THE OPERATION CONSISTED OF BILATERAL MASTECTOMY WITH DISSECTION OF HER AXILLARY LYMPH NODES. SPLIT TRAM ABDOMINAL FLAP WAS NECESSARY FOR RECONSTRUCTION OF HER BREASTS. THE SURGEON DIAGNOSED HER WITH SILICONOSIS WITH SYSTEMIC REACTION SECONDARY TO BILATERAL SILICONE IMPLANTS OF THE BREASTS. THE PLASTIC SURGEON DIAGNOSED SUSPECT CHRONIC SILICONOSIS REACTION WITH CHRONIC SYSTEMIC ILLNESS WITH FIBROSIS & FOREIGN BODY REACTION OF BREAST TISSUE & AXILLARY NODES SECONDARY TO PRIOR SILICONE IMPLANT LEAK. ALSO WITH SJOGREN'S SYNDROME. IT WAS ALSO DETERMINED HER ESOPHAGEAL DYSFUNCTION WAS FELT TO BE SECONDARY TO SYSTEMIC REACTION TO SILICONE FOREIGN BODY GRANULOMAS OF THE PECTORAL MUSCLE, ATELECTASIS, & INFLAMMATION OF THE CONNECTIVE TISSUE OF THE ABDOMINAL FLAP. THE BIOPSIES OF HER BREAST TISSUE, RIGHT MUSCLE, & ALL LYMPH NODES, WERE SWOLLEN, REVEALING REFRACTILE MATERIAL, (PRESUMABLY SILICONE) MULTINUCLEATED GIANT CELLS, MICROCALCIFICATIONS, CHRONIC INFLAMMATION, & FOREIGN BODY GRANULOMAS.RPTR WAS IMPLANTED 4/79 WITH SILICONE IMPLANTS. BY 9/79, SHE HAD ROCK HARD BREASTS, OF WHICH CLOSED CAPSULOTOMIES WERE GIVEN WITH LITTLE SUCCESS. FROM 1979 TO 1991 THE LEAKING SILICONE CAUSED HER TISSUE TO CALCIFY. SHE GREW INTO THE IMPLANT. THE 1991 CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY CRUSHED THE CAPSULE LEAVING A HOLE IN HER RIGHT BREAST IMPLANT. JUNE 1992 MAMMOGRAM REVEALED SILICONE BEING RELEASED INTO RIGHT AXILLA & LYMPHATIC CHAIN. IN SURGERY 1992, THE SILICONE WAS NOT COMPLETELY REMOVED. SHE BECAME VERY ILL AS A RESULT OF THE TOXIC SILICONE IN HER BREASTS & LYMPH NODES. HER BRAIN TESTS HAVE BECOME ABNORMAL.

NONE OF THEIR DRS EVER SUGGESTED THAT THERE COULD BE A CONNECTION SO RPTR MISSED CLASS ACTION CUT-OFF DATE AS WELL-THEY DID NOT KNOW. HAVE BEEN SENT TO EXPERT FOR EVAL. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: PROBLEMS WITH SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: GROSSLY DISRUPTED ELASTOMER SHELLS OF SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS, SUBPECTORAL. OPERATION: TOTAL ABLATIVE CAPSULECTOMIES WITH REMOVAL OF RUPTURED MAMMARY PROSTHETIC MATERIAL; BILATERIAL MASTOPEXIES. ANESTHESIA: GENERAL. INDICATIONS: THIS YOUNG LADY HAD BILATERAL BREAST IMPLANTS PLACED IN 1977 BUT UNFORTUNATELY OVER THE YRS HAS DEVELOPED ONGOING PROBLEMS, RASHES, FIBROMYALGIAS, AND CONCERNS FOR HER HEALTH. AT THIS TIME, SHE FELT THAT SHE NO LONGER NEEDED BREAST IMPLANTS AND ACTUALLY WAS CONSIDERING A SMALL REDUCTION OF HER BREATS. PROCEDURE: UNDER ADEQUATE GENERAL ENDOTRACHEAL ANESTHESIA, SURGEON HAD MARKED THE NIPPLE TO STERNAL DISTANCE AT APPROX 22 CM AND DECIDED TO USE AN INFERIOR DERMAL PEDICLE TYPE REDUCTION BECAUSE OF THE LARGE AMOUNT OF EXTRA SKIN WHICH SHE HAD. SURGEON INITIALLY BEGAN THEIR DISSECTION ON THE RIGHT AND MADE AN INFERIOR DERMAL PEDICLE WHICH WAS BASICALLY INFERIOR DERMAL AS WELL AS LATERAL EXTENSIONS. HOWEVER, THEY THEN CUT DOWN TO EXPOSE THE IMPLANT ALONG ITS MEDIAL BORDER. THE IMPLANT AND CAPSULE WERE THEN REMOVED. HOWEVER, UPON TRYING TO REMOVE IT, SURGEON ACTUALLY NOTED FREE EFFLUX OF THE SILICONE GEL THROUGH THE CAPSULE WHICH WAS THEN WALLED OFF WITH LAPAROTOMY TAPES. SURGEON THEN MADE A COUNTER-INCISION LATERALLY AND VERY CAREFULLY PEELED OFF THE REMAINDER OF THE CAPSULE FROM OFF THE UNDERLYING CHEST WALL AND THE OVERLYING PECTORALIS MUSCLE. HEMOSTASIS WAS ACHIEVED WITH ELECTROCAUTERY. THE ENTIRE CAPSULE ALONG WITH THE UNDERLYING GROSSLY DISRUPTED SILICONE GEL IMPLANT WAS THEN REMOVED AS A UNIT. THE AREA WAS THEN COPIOUSLY IRRIGATED OUT WITH STERILE SALINE ANTIBIOTIC SOLUTION AND VERY CAREFULLY INSPECTED FOR HEMOSTASIS. SURGEON THEN ACTUALLY ELEVATED THE BREAST PEDICLES FROM OFF THE UNDERLYING MUSCLE AND RESUTURED THE MUSCLE DOWN AND MOVED THE PEDICLE SUPERIORLY.

161779|21378512|D|1||RPTR HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO REMOVE ANOTHER DEFLATED IMPLANT THIS PAST SATURDAY. IT HAD BEEN IN PLACE QUITE SATISFACTORILY FOR THREE YRS PREVIOUS. RPTR USED THE SAME TECHNIQUE FOR ITS REMOVAL AS FOR ITS ORIGINAL IMPLANT, THAT IS AN INFERIOR SEMI-CIRUM AREOLAR TRANS GLANDULAR, SUB PECTORAL APPROACH. AS RPTR REACHED THE BOTTOM OF THE BREAST TISSUE AND THE PECTORAL FASCIA, RPTR ENCOUNTERED A CYSTIC STRUCTURE AND WHEN DR DIVIDED THIS THEY DRAINED APPROX 30 CC'S OF SALINE. DIRECTLY BENEATH THIS WAS THE VALVE OF THE IMPLANT. THE TISSUE INGROWTH HAD BEEN LIFTED FOR AN AREA OF APPROX 2 TO 3 CM AROUND THE VALVE. THE REMAINDER OF THE IMPLANT WAS DENSELY, REPEAT DENSELY, ADHERENT TO THE TISSUES TO THE EXTENT THAT WHEN RPTR WAS ATTEMPTING TO SEPARATE IT BY DIGITAL DISSECTION, THEY TORE THE IMPLANT IN THE 10 TO 11 O'CLOCK AREA. DR THINKS BECAUSE OF THE DENSE ADHERENCE OF THE TISSUE AND THE BUBBLE DIRECTLY OVER THE VALVE THAT THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT THIS WAS A VALVE LEAKAGE. UNLIKE PREVIOUS VALVE LEAKAGES THAT RPTR HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO REMOVE, THIS DID NOT HAVE TISSUE INGROWTH AROUND THE STIRRUP. THERE WAS NO OBVIOUS TISSUE IN THE VALVE. SINCE THIS IS 3 YRS OR SO OUT IT IS UNCLEAR TO RPTR HOW ANY DIFFERENT TECHNIQUE MIGHT HAVE PREVENTED THIS.|*|NI|03/25/1998|I|||*||157521.0|0HP|FWM|1.0||SALINE BREAST IMPLANT|Y|NI|700 WARD DR.||SANTA BARBARA|US|MCGHAN CORP.||CA|93111||NI|NI|True

THIS PT HAD ROCK-HARD IMPLANTS BILATERALLY WITH INDETERMINATE MAMMOGRAMS BILATERALLY AND PROBABLE LEAKING SILICONE IMPLANTS BILATERALLY, WHICH WAS DOCUMENTED CLEARLY DURING THE PROCEDURE. THE PREVIOUS INFRAMAMMARY INCISIONS WERE EXTENDED ON EACH SIDE. DISSECTION WAS CARRIED DOWN THROUGH A VERY THICK CAPSULAR SHELL WITH A LARGE AMOUNT OF WHITISH, CREAMY TISSUE COMPATIBLE WITH SAPONIFICATION. BOTH OF THE IMPLANTS WERE BROKEN. THE MATERIAL WAS CONTAINED WITHIN AN EXTREMELY THICK SHELL, AND THE SHELL ITSELF WAS VERY RAGGED WITH EXTENSIVE CALCIFICATION, WHICH BECAUSE OF THE SHARP EDGES COULD CERTAINLY ACCOUNT FOR THE RUPTURED IMPLANTS. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY GEL OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE. TEDIOUSLY, BILATERAL FORMAL CAPSULECTOMIES WERE DONE REMOVING THE ENTIRE CAPSULE FROM JUST SHORT OF THE MIDSTERNUM, THE UPPER RECTUS AND JUST BELOW THE CLAVICLE TO THE SERRATUS ANTERIOR LATERALLY. METICULOUS HEMOSTASIS WAS ACHIEVED. BOTH POCKETS WERE IRRIGATED WITH COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF KANAYCIN SOLUTION. PREPLACED INTERMUSCULAR SUTURES OF INTERRUPTED 3-0 VICRYL WERE UTILIZED. 19 MM BLAKE DRAIN WAS PLACED IN EACH SUBMAMMARY POCKET AND BROUGHT OUT THROUGH A SEPARATE STAB WOUND.

THE IMPLANTS WERE INTRODUCED AFTER BEING SOAKED IN KANAMYCIN, AND SUTURES TIED DOWN, TRANSECTED AND BREASTS CLOSED WITH INTERRUPTED, BURIED 4-0 AND 5-0 VICRYL. EXTENSIVE REPOSITIONING OF THE IMPLANTS AFTER THE CAPSULECTOMY WAS NEEDED BECAUSE OF THE VERY TIGHT, CONTORTED CAPSULE.

IN 1976 MFR'S WERE PERMITTED TO MFR AND SELL BREAST IMPLANTS BY FDA. IN THE SAME YR FDA REQUIRED MFR'S TO SHOW RESEARCHED DATA TO SUPPORT THE USE OF BREAST IMPLANTS. UNTIL THIS RESEARCH COMES OUT, WOMEN PLANNING TO USE BREAST IMPLANTS NEED TO HAVE THE FOLLOWING INFO. BEFORE SURGERY IS SCHEDULED WOMEN NEED TO DISCUSS THE PROS AND CONS OF HAVING BREAST IMPLANTS. BREAST IMPLANTS CAN IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE. PLAY AN IMPORTANT PART IN THE RECOVERY OF WOMEN DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER. SOME WOMEN FIND EXTERNAL BREAST FORMS TO BE SATISFACTORY. TISSUES FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY CAN BE USED TO RECONSTRUCT BREAST. THIS REQUIRES A LONGER OPERATION, LONGER HEALING TIME. BREAST IMPLANT SURGERIES PRESENT THE SAME RISKS AS OTHER SURGERIES, EG ANESTHESIA RELATED RISKS. BREAST IMPLANTS CAN'T BE EXPECTED TO LAST FOREVER. THEY DEFLATE, RUPTURE FOR DIFFERENT REASONS. THEY CAN DEFLATE DUE TO WEAR WITH TIME, RUPTURE DUE TO INJURY. IT IS NOT KNOWN WHEN DEFLATION OCCURS. IT HAS BEEN FOUND THROUGH RESEARCH: WHEN THE SALINE LEAKS IT IS ABSORBED IN THE BODY BECAUSE NORMAL SALINE ALREADY EXISTS IN THE BODY. BREAST IMPLANTS NEED TO BE REMOVED WHEN WORN OUT, MAKE MAMMOGRAPHY DIFFICULT, WOMAN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS RECEIVE MORE RADIATION, THE FORMALIAR OF CAPSULES AROUND THE IMPLANT CAUSES CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CALCIUM DEPOSITS NEED TO BE IDENTIFIED FROM THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH CANCER, INFECTION CAN OCCUR, ESPECIALLY WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF THE OPERATION. INFECTION WITH IMPLANTS ARE HARDER TO TREAT THAN INFECTIONS WITH NORMAL TISSUE. RISK OF HAVING A HEMATOMA: CHANCES OF OCCURRING NOT KNOWN BUT USUALLY OCCURS AFTER SURGERY. SMALL HEMATOMAS CAN BE ABSORBED BY THE BODY, BUT LARGE ONES ARE SURGICALLY DRAINED WHICH CAUSES SCARRING. RESEARCH CONTINUES TO INDICATE THAT FEELING OF PAIN, BURNING SENSTAION MAY INTERFEAR WITH BREAT FEEDING AND SEXUAL RESPONSE. MANY FEEL IMPLANT SHIFTINGS AND FEEL IMPLANT THROUGH THE SKIN. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES LIKE LUPUS, SCLERODERMA, RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND NEUROLOGIC SYMPTOMS SEEN IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PT'S. IN SOME CASES THE SALINE USED HAS BEEN KNOWN TO BE CONTAMINATED WITH BACTERIA. IF SO, ORGANISMS MAY BE RELEASED IN THE BODY IF HER IMPLANTS DEFLATE. ACCORDING TO SCIENTIFIC STUDIES WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS IN GENERAL ARE NOT AT AN INCREASED RISK FOR AUTOIMMUNE OR SELECTIVE TISSUE DISEASES. HOWEVER, THESE STUDIES ARE TOO SMALL TO DETECT WETHER THERE MIGHT BE A SLIGHTLY INCREASED RISK OF ANY OF THESE RARE DISEASES. ALSO THESE CURRENT STUDIES HAVE LOOKED ONLY FOR THE SYMPTOMS OF KNOWN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES, RATHER THAN THE VARIETY OF SYMPTOMS THAT SOME WOMEN ARE EXPERIENCING. SUCH AS SWELLING, JOINT PAIN, ARTHRITIS LIKE PAIN, GENERAL ACHING, UNUSUAL HAIR LOSS, UNEXPLAINED OR UNUSUAL LOSS OF ENERGY, GREATER CHANCE OF GETTING COLDS, VIRUSES, AND FLU SWOLLEN GLANDS OR LYMPH NODES."|ANATOMICALLY SHAPED BREAST IMPLANTS||07/22/1998|A|||*||173408.0||FWM|1.0||BREAST IMPLANTS|Y||700 WARD DR.||SANTA BARBARA|US|MCGHAN MEDICAL CORP.||CA|93111||||True

RIGHT SIDE WAS DONE FIRST AND ON ENTERING THE BREAST THERE WAS FRANK PURULENCY; APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF CUP FULL. THIS WAS SENT OFF FOR A STAT GRAM STAIN WHICH LATER CAME BACK SHOWING WHITE BLOOD CELLS, NO ORGANISMS, COMPATIBLE WITH A STERILE ABSCESS. IN ADDITION TO THIS, THERE WAS A VERY SIGNIFICANT CAPSULE WITH CALCIFICATION, AND THERE APPEARED TO BE A HEMATOMA FORMATION WITHIN THE CAPSULE. CAPSULE WAS VERY TEDIOUSLY REMOVED AFTER THE SILICONE IMPLANT WAS REMOVED. THE SILICONE IMPLANT WEIGHTED APPROX 188 GRAMS AND HAD A LEAK IN THE IMPLANT WITH SILICONE BLEED AROUND THE IMPLANT. BOTH OF THESE IMPLANTS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE 180CC WITH 20CC SALINE ENVELOPE. NEITHER HAD THE SALINE ENVELOPE INTACT AND WHEN THE LEFT SIDE WAS REMOVED IT TURNED OUT TO BE A 130CC IMPLANT, NO 180CC AS THE OPERATIVE DATA SHOWED THAT STAFF HAD. THE LEFT SIDE WAS DONE IN A SIMILAR FASHION, AGAIN WITH INTENSE CAPSULE FORMATION BUT THE IMPLANT WAS INTACT.

""ON RIGHT SIDE (IMPLANT FROM RIGHT BREAST) NO VISIBLE SHELL WAS SEEN"" UPON OPENING THE SURROUNDING SCAR CAPSULE. LEFT SIDE HAD ""SEVERAL GROSS RUPTURES"" OF THE IMPLANT. OUTPATIENT OPERATIVE REPORT, 4-19-93 - POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: MECHANICAL COMPLICATIONS OF SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. MASTODYNIA. RUPTURED SILICONE IMPLANTS, BILATERAL. SKIN LESIONS OF RIGHT FACE AND FOREHEAD. PROCEDURE: THE PT WAS PLACED IN SUPINE POSITION. AFTER ACHIEVING SATISFACTORY GENERAL ANESTHESIA HER CHEST WAS PREPPED AND DRAPED IN THE USUAL FASHION. SKIN MARKINGS WERE PREVIOUSLY MADE WITH THE PT IN A SITTING POSITION. THE INCISION WAS INFILTRATED WITH LIDOCAINE 0.5% WITH EPINEPHRINE. A 5-CM DIAMETER AREOLAR CIRCLE WAS MADE AND THE KEYHOLE SKIN INCISION MADE. THE INTERVENING SKIN WAS THEN DEEPITHELIALIZED TOTALLY. A LATERALLY BASED PARENCHYMAL FLAP WAS CREATED AND THE INCISION WAS CARRIED DIRECTLY THROUGH THE PARENCHYMA DOWN TO THE IMPLANT CAPSULE. UNDER DIRECT VISION, THE IMPLANT CAPSULE WAS DISSECTED FREE FROM SURROUNDING BREAST PARENCHYMA. ON THE RIGHT SIDE, IT WAS REMOVED ""EN TOTO"" AND THERE WERE SEVERAL IRREGULAR PROJECTIONS OF THE CAPSULE. THE CAPSULE WAS INADVERTENTLY ENTERED 2 OR 3 TIMES SUPERFICIALLY. INSTANTLY, STICKY GEL LEAKAGE WAS NOTED EACH TIME AND NO DISCRETE CAPSULAR MATERIAL LAYER WAS SEEN. PROLENE SUTURES WERE USED TO TEMPORARILY CLOSE THE CAPSULE TO AVOID EXTENSIVE LEAKAGE AND TO ALLOW CONTINUATION OF THE IMPLANT REMOVAL. AFTER TOTAL REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT AND CAPSULE, THE BREAST WAS PALPATED FOR ANY MASSES SUSPICIOUS FOR EITHER NEOPLASM OR RETAINED SILICONE GRANULOMA. NONE WAS FOUND. THE WOUND WAS IRRIGATED WITH SALINE. THE LATERALLY BASED PARENCHYMAL FLAP WAS SHIFTED TOWARD THE CENTER AND PLACED UNDERNEATH THE NIPPLE PROJECTION WITH ONE SINGLE #2-0 VICRYL SUTURE. LATER AFTER THE PT WAS PUT IN A SEMISITTING POSITION, ADDITIONAL #2-0 VICRYL SUTURES WERE PLACED ALONG THE INFRAMAMMARY CREASE MEDIALLY AND LATERALLY TO REDEFINE THE INFRAMAMMARY CREASE AS WELL AS ADDING TO THE PROJECTION OF THE NIPPLE. A SIMILAR PROCEDURE WAS PERFORMED ON THE LEFT BREAST AND THE ENTIRE CAPSULE WAS REMOVED. SIMILARLY, WITH A SMALL PUNCTURE OF THE CAPSULE, IT WAS NOTED THAT THERE WAS IMMEDIATE OOZING OF STICKY GEL MATERIAL FROM THE CAPSULE. SIMILAR PALPATION AND IRRIGATION WAS PERFORMED ON THE LEFT SIDE. THE LATERALLY BASED PARENCHYMAL FLAP WAS SUTURED UNDERNEATH THE NIPPLE FOR PROJECTION. SKIN STAPLES WERE USED FOR TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF THE SKIN. THE PT WAS THEN PUT INTO A SEMISITTING POSITION AND THE LOCATION OF THE NIPPLE, THE BREAST SHAPE AND THE INFRAMAMMARY INCISIONS WERE ADJUSTED BY REAPPLYING THE SKIN STAPLES. SKIN MARKINGS WERE THEN MADE AND THE CLOSURE WAS COMPLETED WITH #3-0 VICRYL INTERRUPTED SUTURES FOLLOWED BY #4-0 MAXON SUBCUTICULAR SUTURES. TWO JACKSON-PRATT DRAINS WERE PLACED UNDERNEATH THE BREASTS PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF CLOSURE. LATER THE IMPLANTS WERE OPENED ON THE TABLE. IT WAS NOTED THAT ON THE RIGHT SIDE, THERE WAS TOTAL DISRUPTION OF THE IMPLANT AND THAT NO VISIBLE SHELL WAS SEEN. ON THE LEFT SIDE, THERE WAS ALSO SEVERAL GROSS RUPTURES OF THE IMPLANT AWAY FROM THE AREA OF THE INITIAL INCISION THROUGH THE CAPSULE. IT WAS THEREFORE QUITE OBVIOUS THAT THE IMPLANT HAD BEEN RUPTURED ON BOTH SIDES FOR QUITE SOME TIME. THE IMPLANTS WERE BOTH MEASURED IN VOLUME BY IMMERSION IN SALINE AND EACH WAS FOUND TO BE 300 CC. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS IS INCLUDING THE SCAR CAPSULE AROUND THE IMPLANT. A SMALL SKIN GROWTH AROUND THE RIGHT ALAR BASE AND IN THE MIDFOREHEAD WERE SHARPLY EXCISED. THE WOUND WAS THEN CLOSED WITH INTERRUPTED #6-0 NYLON SUTURES.

RPTR CLAIMS TO HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH THE FOLLOWING AFTER IMPLANTATION: BRAIN LESIONS, ANXIETY &/OR DEPRESSION, ORGANIZATIONAL DIFFICULTY, LACK OF CONCENTRATION, SHORT-TERM MEMORY LOSS, MOOD SWINGS, PROCRASTINATION, GETTING LOST OR CONFUSED, ATYPICAL MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS LIKE SYMPTOMS, REDUCED BLOOD FLOW TO BRAIN, INFLAMMATION, ELEVATED CHOLESTEROL OR TRIGLICERIDES, HEAT OR COLD SENSITIVITIES, RAYNAUD'S DISEASE, CHRONIC DIARRHEA &/OR CONSTIPATION, IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME, SUBSTANTIAL HAIR LOSS NOT CONNECTED WITH MEDICATIONS, FREQUENT MIGRAINES/SEVERE HEADACHES, CHEMICALS, CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE, ATYPICAL LUPUS, SJOGREN'S SYNDROME, INFLAMMATION, SWELLING, PAIN/ARTHRALGIA, PERSISTENT JOINT STIFFNESS, CHRONIC UNEXPLAINED MUSCLE SPASMS, FROZEN SHOULDER, MUSCLE PAIN & BURNING, MUSCLE ATROPHY, FIBROMYALGIA, UNEXPLAINED RASHES, SUN SENSITIVITY, UNEXPLAINED SEVERE ITCHING, CHRONIC INSOMNIA, NON-RESTORATIVE SLEEP, CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME, LONG-TERM EXTREME FATIGUE, CLUMSINESS/DROP THINGS, MISJUDGES DISTANCE/RUN INTO OBJECTS. MD REPORT STATES: THE RIGHT SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT APPEARS TO HAVE MAINTAINED ITS STRUCTURAL SHAPE AND ELASTOMER INTEGRITY. UPON CLOSE EXAMINATION THE ELASTOMER SURFACE APPEARS DRY AND DEVOID OF ANY LUSTROUS APPEARANCE. THE SILICONE GEL WAS TRANSPARENT AND COLORLESS, BUT CONTAINED SOME PRECIPITATED PARTICLES. THE NATURE OF THE PRECIPITATED PARTICLES NOTED ABOVE WAS NOT POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED BECAUSE TO DO SO WOULD HAVE REQUIRED DAMAGING THE ELASTOMER MEMBRANE AND RUINING THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE PROSTHETIC DEVICE. NEVERTHELESS, THE PRECIPITATED PARTICLES APPEAR SIMILAR TO AGGREGATES STUDIES IN OTHER RUPTURED DEVICES. MICROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF THESE PARTICLES REVEALS THAT THEY ARE COTTON-LIKE PARACRYSTALLINE FORMATIONS. THESE FORMATIONS WERE FOUND TO BE CHEMICAL RATHER THAN BIOLOGICAL IN ORIGIN. THE LEFT SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT, UNLIKE ITS COUNTERPART, WAS RUPTURED AND SILICONE GEL WAS EXTERNALIZED. THE SILICONE GEL WAS TRANSPARENT, COLORLESS, AND DID NOT CONTAIN ANY AGGREGATED PARTICLES. THE PATHOLOGY SECTION OF THIS REPORT REVEALS THAT CELLULAR REACTIVE CHANGES OCCURRED RESULTING IN THE FORMATION OF A FIBROCONNECTIVE TISSUE CAPSULE. THIS CAPSULE DISPLAYS SIGNS OF CHRONIC INFLAMMATION. IT CONTAINS FOREIGN BODIES IN TISSUE CELLS AND FIBERS. THE SEARCH REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF SILICONE PARTICLES INFILTRATING THE BREAST CAPSULE TISSUE. THE PARTICLES WERE OBSERVED COATING THE WALLS OF THE EXTRACELLULAR SPACES BETWEEN THE TISSUE FIBERS AND CELL PARENCHYMA. THE ENLARGED PRINTS ILLUSTRATE THE SILICONE PARTICLES IN A BRIGHT OFF-WHITE COLOR THAT STANDS OUT AGAINST THE TISSUE AND BACKGROUND WHICH ARE PURPLE AND BLUE, RESPECTIVELY. THE PRESENCE AND LOCATION OF THE SILICONE GEL PARTICLES IN THESE TISSUES INDICATE THAT THEY HAD MIGRATED FROM A RUPTURED AND/OR BLEEDING IMPLANT. THE BREAST TISSUE REACTED TO THEIR PRESENCE BY FRAGMENTING THE EXTRUDED SILICONE GEL INTO MICROSCOPIC PARTICLES AND ENCAPSULATING THEM WITHIN FIBROUS TISSUE. THESE PROCESSES OCCURRED OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME AND DID NOT RESULT FROM ANY SILICONE LEAKAGE/RUPTURE THAT MAY HAVE OCCURRED DURING SURGERY FOR THEIR REMOVAL. GROSS DESCRIPTION: LABELED AS ""RIGHT BREAST IMPLANT"", THIS SPECIMEN CAME IN A PLASTIC CONTAINER INTACT. THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF BLEEDING OR RUPTURE. THE SILICONE GEL IS COLORLESS BUT SOME PRECIPITATE IS NOTICED INSIDE THE GEL. THE IMPLANT CONTAINS 225CC OF FLUID. THE IMPLANT WEIGHS 228.7 GRAMS AND MEASURES 12CM IN DIAMETER. LABELED AS ""LEFT BREAST IMPLANT"", THIS SPECIMEN CAME IN A PLASTIC CONTAINER RUPTURED. THE RUPTURE POINT IS 2CM IN LENGTH AND SILICONE GEL CAN BE SEEN PROTRUDING THROUGH THE ORIFICE. THE GEL IS CLEAR AND NO PRECIPITATE IS NOTICED. THE IMPLANT MEASURES 12.5CM IN DIAMETER AND WEIGHS 226.2 GRAMS. OPERATIVE REPORT: THIS IS A 52 YEAR OLD WHITE FEMALE WHO REQUESTED REMOVAL OF HER BILATERAL BREAST PROSTHESES. THIS PT UNDERWENT SILICONE BREAST AUGMENTATION IN 6/86 AND NOW RELATES A HISTORY OF JOINT PAINS AND RINGING IN HER EARS SINCE 3/92. AT THE TIME OF INITIAL CONSULTATION THE POSSIBILITY OF REPLACING THE IMPLANTS WITH SALINE FILLED PROSTHESES WAS DISCUSSED AND HER HUSBAND APPEARED TO FAVOR THIS. HOWEVER, THE PT WAS ADAMANT THAT SHE WANTED NO IMPLANTS AT ALL AND THEREFORE IT WAS MENTIONED THAT HER BREASTS WOULD BE SOMEWHAT PTOTIC AFTER THE SURGERY. SURGICAL PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION REPORT: THE SPECIMEN IS RECEIVED IN THE FRESH STATE, LABELLED WITH THE PT'S NAME AND ACCESSION NUMBER AS ""SALIVARY GLAND BIOPSY"", AND CONSISTS OF ONE IRREGULAR PIECE OF PINK, TAN, AND RED SOFT TISSUE MEASURING 0.8X 0.7X 0.4CM. ENTIRELY SUBMITTED. ONE CASSETTE. THE SPECIMEN IS RECEIVED IN THE FRESH STATE, LABELLED WITH THE PT'S NAME AND ACCESSION NUMBER AS ""RIGHT OLD BREAST PROSTHESIS"", CONSISTS OF ONE SEMI-TRANSPARENT SYNTHETIC BREAST IMPLANT CONTAINING THE FOLLOWING NUMBERS 225. THE BREAST IMPLANT IS INTACT AND WEIGHS 229 GRAMS. NO SECTIONS SUBMITTED. GROSS ONLY. THE SPECIMEN IS RECEIVED IN THE FRESH STATE, LABELLED WITH THE PT'S NAME AND ACCESSION NUMBER AS ""RIGHT BREAST TISSUE CAPSULE"", CONSISTS OF TWO IRREGULAR PIECES OF GREY TAN SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS MEMBRANOUS FATTY TISSUE MEASURING 11.8 X 2.0 X 0.6CM.

280331|191820|D|1||"I HAD COMPLICATIONS IMMEDIATELY. I HAD TO HAVE 2 ADD'L SURGERIES TO CORRECT THE COMPLICATIONS. THEY HARDENED, MOVED IN MY CHEST CAVITY, AND THEY LEAKED. I STARTED TO ITCH IMMEDIATELY, AND BECAME ALLERGIC TO MANY THINGS. MY BODY FELT FATIGUED, I HAD MIGRAINE HEADACHES, AND COULDN'T SLEEP. I BEGAN TO ACHE ALL OVER, HAD PANIC ATTACKS, MY VISION CHANGED RAPIDLY. I KEPT REPORTING VARIOUS COMPLAINTS TO MY PHYSICIANS, NO ONE COULD HELP ME, EVEN THOUGH THEY KEPT TRYING. I BECAME DEPRESSED, MY WHOLE BODY BEGAN TO CHANGE, MY BREASTS WERE ITCHING DEEP INSIDE, WERE COMPLETELY NUMB. THEY WERE HOT TO TOUCH, AND PAINFUL, I WAS TOLD IT WOULD GO AWAY. THE SYMPTOMS PROGRESSED RAPIDLY, EACH TIME THEY WENT BACK IN, THEY USED THE SAME IMPLANTS, EVEN REFILLED THE ONE THAT LEAKED. MY MAMMOGRAMS SHOWED A BULGE, THE RADIOLOGIST ADVISED ME TO REMOVE THEM, THE PLASTIC SURGEON DENIED WHAT THE FILM SHOWED. I HAD A SONOGRAM LATER, AND IT SHOWED MY LYMPH NODES WERE SWOLLEN. THEY IDENTIFIED GEL OUTSIDE OF THE CAPSULES. MY HEALTH WAS DECLINING RAPIDLY. THE NURSES TOLD ME ABOUT THE ADVERSE EFFECTS, TWO MONTHS BEFORE THIS LITIGATION WAS TO CLOSE. I HAD TO SEE AN INTERNAL SPECIALIST, WHO DIAGNOSED ME WITH SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS, SO DID A RHEUMATOLOGIST, AND SO DID A NEUROLOGIST. I HAVE SEIZURES, CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDER, ATYPICAL LUPUS, SJOGREN'S, RAYNAUD'S, NUMEROUS OTHER CONDITIONS. I HAVE BEEN HOSPITALIZED, GONE TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM, STAYED HOME BECAUSE I AM NOW UNEMPLOYABLE. NO ONE WILL INSURE ME NOW, AND THIS IS A PARTIAL LIST OF MY SYMPTOMS, AND DISORDERS. I AM POSITIVE MY PATHOLOGIST'S REPORT SHOWED A HOLE IN MY IMPLANT. MY VISION IS VERY IMPAIRED NOW. I CAN'T GET OUT OF BED, WITHOUT HELP, AND I AM CONSTANTLY ILL. I AM IN HORRENDOUS PAIN EACH DAY. MY MEMORY IS IMPAIRED SIGNIFICANTLY. I GET LOST, I CAN'T EVEN SHOP FOR GROCERIES, OR COOK A MEAL NOW. I DON'T GO INTO A DEEP SLEEP PATTERN, MY BRAIN STAYS ON RUN, WHILE MY BODY CRIES IN PAIN. MY LEGS AND FEET STAY SWOLLEN HUGE. MY FINGERS DON'T MOVE, I HAVE CRAMPS IN MY HANDS, LEGS, AND FEET THAT MAKE MY HANDS DRAW INTO GNARLS. I HAVE NIGHT SWEATS, MY FACE IS GETTING A PINK RASH OVER MY NOSE. MY BRAIN HAS ELECTRIC LIGHT SHOWS, AND I WAKE UP EXHAUSTED. MY WHOLE LIFE HAS CHANGED. MY IMMUNE SYSTEM IS COMPROMISED, I CAN'T BE AROUND ANYONE WHO IS ILL, OR I GET ILL. I'M SO ALLERGIC TO ALL CHEMICALS, I HAVE SEVERE REACTIONS TO THEM. MY VOICE HAS CHANGED, MY SPEECH IS SLURRED, I'M NOT ME NOW. MY FACE HAS BROKEN OUT IN BLISTERS, I'M ALLERGIC TO THE SUN, AND I HAVE ASTHMA NOW. I CAN'T BEGIN TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAS HAPPENED. I HAVE SOMEONE TYPING FOR ME, MY BRAIN CAN'T PUT THE WORDS TOGETHER NOW. I HAD NONE OF THESE PROBLEMS BEFORE IMPLANTS. I WAS NEVER TOLD OF THE CHEMICALS IN IMPLANTS. I WAS TOLD THAT IT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER TO DETECT BREAST CANCER. I HAD FIBRO-CYSTIC BREAST DISEASE. I AM POSITIVE THE IMPLANTS ARE WHAT HAS CAUSED ME TO BECOME EXTREMELY DISABLED, I AM FORCED TO FILE FOR DISABILITY. I WOULD RATHER BE THE PRODUCTIVE PERSON I WAS BEFORE I HAD SILICONE IMPLANTS. I RARELY AM ABLE TO GO OUT. I CAN'T HOLD MY GRANDBABIES OR PARTICIPATE IN A NORMAL LIFE. I AM SEXUALLY NOT A LADY NOW. I CAN'T HAVE A CLIMAX, MY VAGINA IS SO DRY, AND PAINFUL. WHY DID THE FDA ALLOW THIS? I THOUGHT IMPLANTS WERE SAFE, AND HAD BEEN APPROVED. NOW I'M READING I'VE BEEN TOXICALLY POISONED. I TRY TO USE MY MIND TO CONTROL PAIN. I AM ILL, I WANT TO BE WELL, I WANT TO BE FREE FROM ALL OF THE THINGS I HAVE WRONG WITH ME NOW. I TRY SO HARD, BUT I CAN'T DO THINGS. I WILL NEVER GIVE UP TRYING. I WISH I WAS WELL ENOUGH TO BE ME AGAIN NOW. I STAY AWAY FROM THE DOCTORS, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY MORE. I CAN'T HEAR WELL, AND I'M SO TIRED. I DON'T LEAD A NORMAL LIFE. I'M SICK, AND I'M JUST TRYING TO HIDE FROM ANY MORE TESTS, OR HOSPS. THESE CHEST PAINS WERE NEVER NORMAL FOR A 35 YEAR OLD LADY WHO EXERCIZED, WAS PHYSICALLY IN SHAPE. NOW I CAN'T RAISE MY ARMS, THE PAIN GOES FROM MY BREAST CLEAR DOWN TO MY FINGERTIPS. I CAN'T TELL YOU ANY MORE, IT'S TOO UPSETTING TO LOOK AT. I HAD A HYSTERECTOMY, I HEMORRHAGED FOR MONTHS. I'VE HAD A KIDNEY STONE, MY BLADDER IS BLOCKED, INFECTED ALL THE TIME, AND THEY CAN'T DO SURGERY. I HAVE A YEAST INFECTION CONTINUALLY. MY NAILS HAVE HAD A FUNGUS. MY SKIN HAS HUGE BLOOD PLACES THE SIZE OF A MAN'S HAND, ON MY FOREARMS ALWAYS, MY SKIN IS LIKE TISSUE PAPER. I FREEZE WHEN IT IS 90 DEGREES. SINUS, OH I COULD JUST KEEP GOING ON, AND ON BUT I WON'T. I THINK YOU HAVE READ ENOUGH. I'M BACK IN KINDERGARTEN, AND I WAS INTELLIGENT ONCE.

294958|148139|D|1||"PT UNDERWENT BILATERAL AUGMENTATION MAMMOPLASTY SEVERAL YEARS AGO. APPROX THREE WEEKS AGO THEY NOTICED THAT THE LEFT BREAST HAD BECOME SIGNIFICANTLY FLAT COMPARED TO THE RIGHT. THEY ALSO SUSPECT A LEAK IN THE RIGHT IN THAT THEY FEEL THEY ARE SMALLER ON THE SIDE. THEY ARE NOW TAKEN TO THE OPERATING ROOM FOR SUBSEQUENT REPLACEMENT OF BILATERAL IMPLANTS. PROCEDURE: AFTER ADMINISTRATION OF GENERAL ENDOTRACHEAL ANESTHESIA, THE PT WAS PREPPED AND DRAPED IN A STERILE FASHION. SUBSEQUENTLY A #15 BLADE WAS UTILIZED TO EXCISE THE PREVIOUS INFRAMAMMARY SCAR. BOVIE CAUTERIZATION WAS UTILIZED TO DISSECT THROUGH THE UNDERLYING BREAST IMPLANT CAPSULE. HERE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE BREAST IMPLANT WAS TOTALLY FLAT AND WAS REMOVED FROM ITS POCKET. THE CAPSULE WAS EXAMINED AND FOUND TO STILL TO RETAIN MOST OF ITS BASE. PT WAS NOTED TO HAVE AN INFRAMAMMARY CREASE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER BY AT LEAST 2CM ON THE LEFT AS COMPARED TO THE RIGHT. AN INFERIOR CAPSULOTOMY WAS PERFORMED AFTER REFLECTION OF THE BREAST CAPSULE EXTENDING FROM APPROX THE THREE O'CLOCK POSITION OF THE LATERAL CAPSULE TO THE NINE O'CLOCK POSITION OF THE MEDIAL CAPSULE. HEMOSTASIS WAS ACHIEVED WITH BOVIE CAUTERIZATION. AFTER COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF NORMAL SALINE WAS UTILIZED TO IRRIGATE THE POCKET, A 350CC IMPLANT WAS BROUGHT INTO THE FIELD, EVACUATED OF ALL AIR AND FILLED WITH 120CC OF SALINE. SUBSEQUENTLY THIS WAS THEN PLACED INTO THE POCKET AND THEN OVERFILLED TO MFR'S SPECIFICATIONS OF 400CC. AFTER REMOVING THE ANTERIOR FILL APPARATUS AND REPLACING THE PLUG, THE IMPLANT WAS APPROPRIATELY POSITIONED IN THE CAPSULE. PREPLACED 3-0 VICRYL SUTURES WERE THEN TIED DOWN THROUGH THE CAPSULAR PORTION OF THE ORIGINAL INCISION AND BURIED INTERRUPTED 4-0 PDS SUTURE WAS UTILIZED FOR COAPTATION OF DERMAL SKIN EDGES. ATTENTION WAS THEN TURNED TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE WHERE AGAIN THE PREVIOUS SCAR WAS EXCISED AND THEN BOVIE CAUTERIZATION UTILIZED TO DIVIDE DOWN AND THROUGH THE UNDERLYING IMPLANT CAPSULE. HERE THEN THE IMPLANT WAS REMOVED FROM ITS POCKET. IT APPEARED TO BE INTACT AS BEST COULD BE DETERMINED. BOTH IMPLANTS WERE APPROPRIATELY PACKAGED TO BE RETURNED TO MENTOR. AFTER EXAMINING THE CAPSULE, COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF NORMAL SALINE WAS UTILIZED TO IRRIGATE THE POCKET. A SECOND 350CC IMPLANT WAS BROUGHT TO THE FIELD, SUBSEQUENTLY FILLED WITH 120CC SALINE AND EVACUATED OF ALL AIR. AFTER PREPLACING AGAIN 3-0 VICRYL THROUGH THE INFERIOR CAPSULAR INCISION, THE IMPLANT WAS THEN PLACED INTO THE POCKET AND OVERFILLED TO MFR'S SPECIFICATIONS OF 400CC SALINE SOLUTION. THE ANTERIOR FILL APPARATUS WAS REMOVED AND THE PLUG REPLACED. AFTER POSITIONING THE IMPLANT, IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE CAPSULE EXTENDED MUCH FARTHER LATERALLY I.E. TO THE MID-AXILLARY LINE AS COMPARED TO THE RIGHT SIDE WHICH EXTENDED ONLY TO THE ______-AXILLARY LINE. SUBSEQUENTLY THIS ALSO CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT ABNORMAL CONCAVITY AS THE IMPLANT PULLED AWAY FROM ITS MEDIAL CAPSULE REFLECTION CAUSING A TELLTALE CONCAVITY IN THIS AREA. THE IMPLANT SUBSEQUENTLY WAS REMOVED FROM THE POCKET AND A CAPSULOPLASTY PERFORMED LATERALLY BY UTILIZING A SPINAL NEEDLE AS WELL AS BRILLIANT GREEN TO MARK THE APPROX NEW REFLECTIONS SYMMETRIC WITH THE OPPOSITE SIDE THROUGH THE ENTIRE BREAST AFTER THIS WAS MARKED APPROPRIATELY. A CAPSULOTOMY THEN WAS PERFORMED LATERALLY ACROSS THIS PRE-MARKED AREA ALONG THE LATERAL ASPECT OF THE CAPSULE DOME AS WELL AS ALONG THE CHEST WALL. THE CAPSULOPLASTY WAS THEN PERFORMED WITH RUNNING 2-0 VICRYL SUTURE, SUTURING THE MOST MEDIAL EDGES OF THE CAPSULOTOMIES TOGETHER. AFTER THIS WAS SECURELY IN PLACE, THE IMPLANT WAS BROUGHT INTO THE FIELD AND PLACED BACK INTO THE POCKET WHERE THEN IT APPEARED TO BE MUCH MORE SYMMETRIC WITH THE OPPOSITE SIDE IN TERMS OF ITS POSITION. AGAIN THE PREPLACED 3-0 VICRYL SUTURES WERE THEN TIED DOWN ALONG THE INFERIOR CAPSULAR INCISION. INVERTED INTERRUPTED 4-0 PDS SUTURE WAS UTILIZED FOR COAPTATION OF DERMAL SKIN EDGES. AFTER TREATING THIS SKIN WITH USE OF BENZOIN, 1/2"" STERI-STRIPS WERE APPLIED LONGITUDINALLY FOR COAPTATION OF EPIDERMIS. A CIRCUMTHORACIC DRESSING WAS APPLIED CONSISTING OF MULTIPLE FLUFFS ANTERIORLY ABOUT BOTH BREASTS, SECURED WITH THE USE OF A PIZZA BOARD WITH TWO WRAPS OF KERLIX ROLL AS WELL AS TWO 6"" ACE WRAPS SECURED ANTERIORLY WITH 2"" WIDE SILK TAPE. THE PT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY EXTUBATED AND TAKEN TO THE RECOVERY ROOM. FINAL SPONGE AND NEEDLE COUNTS WERE CORRECT. TOTAL TIME OF OPERATION WAS APPROX ONE HOUR AND TEN MINUTES. THE TOTAL BLOOD LOSS WAS APPROX 25CC. THE PT WAS IN THE OPERATING ROOM FOR LESS THAN ONE AND ONE-HALF HOURS."|UNK|UNK|09/08/2000|V||UNKNOWN|Y||285491.0||FWM|1.0||SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS|Y|UNK|UNK||UNK|*|UNK|||||UNK|UNK|True

404770|270334|D|1||"PURE MEDICAL HEALTH PROBLEM, CAUSED BY A DUBIOUS MEDICAL DEVICE, WHICH MADE VICTIMS OF RPTR'S FAMILY AND RPTR. CHILDREN NEVER HAD A REAL PARENT, SPOUSE NEVER A SPOUSE. AFTER A CHRONIC BREAST INFECTION, RPTR GOT BREAST IMPLANTS ADVISED. SO, THEY COULD ""AT LEAST"" WEAR A BRA. RPTR REALLY LOVED THAT IDEA. SURGEON TOLD RPTR: ""WHEN YOU DIE AT, SAY 80, YOUR BREASTS WILL BE STAYING STRAIGHT AHEAD. NO BREAST PROBLEMS ANYMORE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE"". IT TURNED OUT TO BE A GREAT DISASTER. RPTR HAD 18 SURGERIES. PROSTHESIS IN/OUT, IN/OUT, TRANSPLANTATION OF OWN TISSUE (WITHOUT SUCCESS), ANOTHER RECONSTRUCTION-TRY, PROSTHESIS IN/OUT, ETC. WITHIN 3 YEARS, RPTR GOT RHEUMATISM (R.A.) DIAGNOSED (WAS FORCED TO MOVE INTO A SPECIAL HOUSE FOR DISABLED PEOPLE) AND A LOT OF OTHER DISEASES WHICH DIDN'T FIT THEM AT ALL. THEIR BODY TOLD ANOTHER TALE, SO EVERYTHING WAS ALL IN THEIR MIND. IN 1990 A RUPTURED IMPLANT WAS REMOVED AND A ""VERY SAFE"" THICK ONE RE-IMPLANTED. SPECIALIST ASSURED RPTR THAT THIS NEW DEVICE DIDN'T CAUSE PROBLEMS. RPTR RECOVERED, COULD WALK WITHOUT PAIN (MIRACLE). ALAS ONLY FOR 2 MOS. THE NEW (LOW BLEED) IMPLANT STARTED TO POISON RPTR'S BODY AGAIN AND MADE THEM SICK AS NEVER BEFORE. RPTR WAS COMPLETELY DISABLED AND HELPLESS. THE ONLY WAY TO SURVIVE WAS A RADICAL EXPLANTATION OF THIS SICK-MAKER, A VERY HARD DECISION. DURING THAT TIME RPTR LAID HANDS ON AN INTERESTING MEDICAL REPORT (PUBLICIZED IN 1987) ABOUT THE POSSIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN SILICONE AND IMMUNE DISORDERS LIKE RHEUMATISM, NAMED H.A.D., ILUMAN ADJUVANT DISEASE. RPTR COULD NOT AND STILL CANNOT FIND WORDS TO EXPRESS THEIR FEELINGS OF ANGER AND BETRAYAL. ALL THOSE LOST YEARS. ALL THIS PAIN, SCARS, DESPAIR. NOT ONLY FOR THEMSELF, ALSO FOR THEIR SPOUSE AND CHILDREN. BEFORE RPTR REALIZED IT THEY WERE THE ""HEAD OF A FAST GROWING SUPPORT GROUP FOR WOMEN WITH SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS, OFFICIALLY REGISTERED BY LAW 5/7/92. RPTR'S BODY LOOKED AWFUL; ONE BREAST WAS COMPLETELY GONE. SINCE RPTR STARTED THEIR CRUSADE THEY HAVE HEARD THE VERY SAME STORY OVER 4,000 TIMES. THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR RPTR. CONTACTED OTHER GROUPS AROUND THE WORLD, ONLY ""THE TONGUE"" WAS DIFFERENT, THE TALE THE VERY SAME. RPTR ALSO WROTE OR PHONED TO DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES ALL OVER THE WORLD TO INFORM THEMSELF AS WELL AS POSSIBLE. PLASTIC SURGEONS HARDLY INFORM THE WOMEN ABOUT POSSIBLE FUTURE HEALTH RISKS BOTH TO THEMSELVES AND THEIR YET UNBORN BABIES. THEY ONLY SHOW NICE PICTURES. ""SILICONE IS AN INERT MATERIAL, NO DANGER AT ALL! THE WORLDWIDE COMMOTION IS GOSSIP FROM HYSTERICAL WOMEN, OUT FOR MONEY. NOTHING SCIENTIFIC PROVEN, NO LINK IS FOUND TILL NOW, AS LONG AS IT ISN'T BANNED I GO ON!"", IS THEIR FAVORITE SLOGAN, IT IS POSSIBLE HERE TO BUY YOUR BREASTS NOW AND PAY MONTHLY, YOU CAN READ THAT IN ALL ADS IN ALL NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES. I THINK THAT IS A VERY HYPOCRITICAL WAY TO TRANSLATE THE OATH OF HYPOCRATIS, THE MAMMON ABOVE THE HUMAN BEINGS. SINCE THE START OF SUPPORT GROUP IN 1992 TILL NOW RPTR HAS ANSWERED OVER 20,000 TELEPHONE-CALLS (FROM 5 MINS TO 1 1/2 HRS OR EVEN MORE) AND HEARD MORE THAN 4,000 TIMES THE VERY SAME STORY, SOMETIMES ANONYMOUS. THEY ALL RECEIVED INFORMATION-PACKET TO HELP THEM TO FIND THEIR WAY. GROUP ALSO SENT THE WOMEN DIFFERENT QUESTIONNAIRES FOR MORE INVESTIGATION. THE FIRST ONE WITH ABOUT 100 ANSWER POSSIBILITIES. AGE OF THE WOMEN BETWEEN 17-78 YEARS. AGE OF IMPLANTS: ONE MONTH-35 YEARS. THE RESULTS WERE SHOCKING, BUT NOT SCIENTIFIC, THAT CAME LATER THANKS TO THE UNIVERSITY WHO ANALYZED ALL RESULTS. THE MOST SHOCKING PART, THE ANSWERS FROM MOTHERS WITH CHILDREN BEFORE AND AFTER THEIR IMPLANTS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE KIDS AND THEIR MEDICAL COMPLAINTS. OVER 199 CHILDREN ARE REGISTERED. FINDINGS WERE THE VERY SAME AS WRITTEN IN A CHILDREN HOSPITAL REPORT (1993). 83% OF THE WOMEN WHO CONTACTED SUPPORT GROUP DID HAVE MANY OF THE WELL-KNOWN DISEASES. THAT IS OVER 10% OF THE VALUED 30,000 WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS IN RTPR'S COUNTRY. 14% WANTED INFO ABOUT AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION. 2% DID NOT (YET) HAVE PROBLEMS. 1% WAS SUFFERING DUE TO OTHER MEDICAL DEVICES LIKE HIPS, TESTICLES, INJECTIONS, NEEDLES, ETC. OF THOSE 83% IS THE SCORE 99% WITH MUSCLE/JOINT PAINS, OFTEN FALSELY DIAGNOSED AS R.A. OR FIBROMYALGIA. CHRONIC FATIGUE: 98%. MEMORY LOSS, SHORT MEMORY AND BAD CONCENTRATION: 93%. MOST OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS (1487, ALL DOCUMENTED) SCORED HIGHER THAN 70%. BY EXPLANATION OVER 80% OF THE IMPLANTS WERE RUPTURED OR VISIBLY LEAKING/BLEEDING. THAT IS WHAT THE WOMEN TOLD RPTR, BUT MOSTLY NOT WRITTEN IN THEIR FILES NOR REGISTERED. 40% OF THE EXPLANTED WOMEN RECOVERED QUITE A LOT WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR. ABOUT 45% NEEDED 2 TO 5 YEARS TO FEEL BETTER. THE OTHERS, ALAS, HAVE PASSED THE WAY OF NO RETURN. NO IDEA HOW LONG THEY'LL STAY AMONG THEM. 15-20 LADIES ARE TERRIBLY SICK, GOING DOWN HILL DAILY, SOME ARE TERMINAL BY NOW. 7 TIMES THEY FOUND A TUMOR TOO LATE (AS FAR AS RPTR HAS HEARD). 16 LADIES ALREADY DIED, WITHOUT KNOWING WHY. FIVE OF THEM RPTR KNEW VERY WELL, ALMOST TILL THE VERY LAST MINUTE. ONE COMMITTED SUICIDE, 34 YEARS OLD. THEY COULD NOT STAND THE PAIN ANYMORE AND THEIR MAIMED BODY. BUT MOST OF THE IMPLANTS WERE RUPTURED (ENVELOPE GONE) OR THERE WAS VISIBLE BLEEDING. THERE ARE ALSO 2 BABIES RPTR KNOWS ABOUT. ONE CHOKED IN MUCUS AFTER BEING BREASTFED, ONLY 6 WEEKS OLD. THE OTHER ONE BLED TO DEATH, 2 WEEKS BEFORE BIRTH. NO REASON FOUND. ONLY A STRANGE DISORDER IN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. HEALTH GOVERNMENT DOESN'T TAKE ALL COMPLAINTS SERIOUSLY; THEY DON'T REALIZE THE REALITY IS EVEN MORE THAN WORSE. THEY HARDLY LISTEN TO RPTR. THEY EVEN DON'T BELIEVE RPTR AND DO NOTHING FOR THE SICK WOMEN, CHILDREN AND MEN. NO MEDICATION, NO TREATMENT, NO HELP AT ALL FOR THIS BETRAYED POPULATION. RPTR THINKS ALL THEIR HEALTH MINISTERS ARE RESPONSIBLE. THEY ALLOW DUBIOUS MEDICAL DEVICES ON THE MARKETS; THE VERY SAME DEVICE THAT IS BANNED IN AMERICA AND OTHER COUNTRIES SINCE 1992."|SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT|NI|07/10/2002|*|||*||393767.0|*|FTR|1.0||LOW BLEED SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT|Y|NI|UNK||UNK|*|UNK|||||NI|NI|True

WHEN PT GOT THE PAPERWORK TO SIGN WITH NUMEROUS OTHER WARNINGS ON IT PT ASKED QUESTIONS AND WAS ASSURED THAT THOSE WERE ONLY BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE SILICONE -- NOT SALINE.

HE THEN ASKED IF PT HAD EVER HAD A LEAK. PT STARTED RESEARCHING AND BECAME EXTREMELY TERRIFIED AFTER FINDING SEVERAL DIFFERENT WEB SITES WITH OTHER WOMEN'S BREAST IMPLANT HORROR STORIES. AFTER DOING A LOT OF SOUL SEARCHING AND RESEARCH PT DECIDED TO HAVE THEM REMOVED. PT WENT BACK TO IMPLANTING PLASTIC SURGEON TO ASK HIM TO DO IT. PT MENTIONED ALL OF THE INFO FOUND OUT AND TOLD HIM.

PT SAID THAT THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF THEM CHANGING THEIR MIND BUT HE WOULDN'T LISTEN. PT TOLD HIM THAT THEY WERE SCARED AND WOULD GLADLY PAY FOR THE OPERATION. PT WASN'T ASKING FOR A FREEBIE. HE TREATED PT HORRIBLY SAYING THAT PT NEEDED TO BE TESTED FOR CANCER AND OTHER DISEASES AS ILLNESSES WERE PROBABLY FROM ONE OF THOSE AND HE COULDN'T OPERATE IF PT HAD CANCER. PT ASSURED HIM SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE CONVERSATION THAT THEY WOULD HAVE ALL OF THE TESTS PERFORMED THAT HE FELT NECESSARY TO RULE THOSE OUT FIRST. AT THIS POINT IN HIS OFFICE PT STARTED CRYING AND BEGGING HIM TO PLEASE PUT THEM ON HIS SCHEDULE AS HE IS PRETTY BOOKED ALL OF THE TIME AND IN THE MEANTIME PT WOULD HAVE ALL OF THE TESTING DONE HE NEEDED.

NOT A DAY GOES BY THAT I WISH I NEVER GOT THEM. I HOLD THE FDA PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR MY HEALTH. HAD I KNOWN THE TRUTH MY DECISION WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT.

IN 2003 HER SURGEON DISCOVERED A LEFT BREAST LUMP ON MRI CONSISTENT WITH IMPLANT RUPTURE. THE SURGEON WOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT, ONLY IF CONSUMER WOULD HAVE IT (THE IMPLANT) REPLACED. SHE WAS FORCED TO SELL HER HOME IN ORDER TO HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR THE REMOVAL OF IMPLANTS WITHOUT REPLACEMENT. THIS REQUIRED AN EMERGENCY EVACUATION TO ANOTHER CITY. THE EVACUATION, ACCORDING TO THE CONSUMER WAS REQUIRED BECAUSE SHE BECAME EXTREMELY ILL. THE IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED IN 2006 AND SHE FEELS THAT ALL HER MEDICAL PROBLEMS WERE FROM SEEPAGE OF THEIR (THE IMPLANT'S) CONTENTS INTO HER BODY. THESE MEDICAL PROBLEMS INCLUDE: DIMINISHED BRAIN FUNCTION, DEPRESSION, GRANULES IN THE EYES, FIBROMYALGIA, FATIGUE, SCALP SORES, RASH AND MORE.

I COULD NOT THINK WELL, FELT LIKE I WAS IN A FOG ALL THE TIME, DEVELOPED SEVERE FOOD ALLERGIES AND STARTED GETTING DEBILITATING HEADACHES TO NEARLY EVERYTHING I ATE. IT APPEARED THAT MY IMMUNE SYSTEM WAS SERIOUSLY IN TROUBLE. OVER THE YEARS I WENT TO MANY DOCTORS TRYING TO DETERMINE WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME AND I SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY TRYING VARIOUS THINGS TRYING TO GET WELL. I DID HAVE ONE DOCTOR SUGGEST THAT IT MIGHT BE THE IMPLANTS BUT I DID NOT TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY. RECENTLY, AFTER 18 YEARS OF SUFFERING, I DECIDED TO HAVE EXPLANT SURGERY IN HOPES OF REGAINING MY HEALTH. THE SURGERY WAS 3 WEEKS AGO AND THOUGH THE IMPLANTS WERE NOT RUPTURED, THEY HAD SOME LEAKAGE THROUGH THE PORES OF THE SILICONE SHELL THAT ENCASED THE IMPLANT. THE OUTSIDE OF THE IMPLANTS WAS VERY STICKY AND WOULD STICK TO OUR HANDS. IT IS TOO EARLY TO TELL HOW MUCH HEALING I WILL EXPERIENCE SINCE IT HAS ONLY BEEN 3 WEEKS SINCE EXPLANT BUT ALREADY I CAN TELL THAT MUCH OF THE BRAIN FOG HAS LIFTED.|*|*|09/26/2006|V||*|*||752831.0|0HP|FTR|1.0||SILICONE IMPLANTS|Y|*|*||*|*|*|||||*|*|True

THE LEFT CAPSULE ONLY CONSISTS OF 232 CC OF -280 CC- OF SILICONE, 48 CC COULD NOT BE FOUND IN THE CAPSULE. THE SURGEON ALSO TOLD ME THERE WAS EVIDENCE THAT THE RIGHT BREAST IMPLANT SILICONE WAS BLEEDING THRU THE IMPLANT. MY IMPLANTS WERE VERY SMALL, AND I HAD THEM FOR 18 YEARS. THERE WAS VERY LITTLE CHANGE IN MY BREAST -WEIGHT GAIN AND AGE- AND YOU COULD NOT TELL THAT THE LEFT ONE HAD RUPTURE. I DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG THE IMPLANT HAS BEEN RUPTURED. I HAVE HAD NUMEROUS ULTRASOUNDS THROUGHOUT THE YEARS. UNFORTUNATELY YOU CAN HAVE A RUPTURED IMPLANT AND GET A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH FROM THE DR THAT DIAGNOSES THE READING OF THE X RAY. HE ONLY LOOKS FOR CANCER AND THE REPORT TO YOUR MD WILL NOT STATE THAT YOU HAVE A RUPTURED IMPLANT. THE TECH THAT WAS DOING MY SISTER'S MAMMOGRAM TOLD HER THAT HER IMPLANTS DID NOT LOOK NORMAL AND SHOULD CONTACT HER PLASTIC SURGEON TO DO FURTHER TEST. WHEN THE RESULTS OF THE MAMMOGRAM WERE FORWARDED TO THER MD, THE DOCTOR THAT DIAGNOSED THE TEST GAVE HER A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH. WHEN MY SISTER'S PLASTIC SURGEON OBTAINED THE SAME MAMMOGRAM, IT WAS VERY OBVIOUS THAT HER LEFT IMPLANT WAS VERY RUPTURED AND THE RIGHT ONE HAD A BULGE, WHICH REPRESENTS A LEAK. THANK GOD FOR THAT TECH THAT STUCK HER NECK OUT, TO ALERT MY SISTER. MY SISTER CONTACTED ME AND TOLD ME, MY TEST SHOULD BE PULLED AND REVIEWED BY A PLASTIC SURGEON. THE IMPLANTS ONLY HAVE A TIME SPAN OF 12- TO 15 YEARS AND DO NOT LAST FOREVER. THE LAW SHOULD REQUIRE THAT THE DR'S DIAGNOSTIC REPORT INCLUDE BREAST IMPLANT COMPLICATIONS AND RUPTURES.

I HAD SILICONE LEAKING OUT OF NIPPLE AREAS, CHEST WALL INFLAMMATION, HIGH FEVERS, MUSCLE PAIN/WEAKNESS/FATIGUE, SKIN LESIONS, DRY EYES, MOUTH, JOINT PAIN, NUMBNESS OF EXTREMITIES, NERVOUS SYSTEM DAMAGE. IN 1993, AFTER RUPTURE WAS DETECTED THESE IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED. THE FINDINGS WERE THE CAPSULE IN THE BREAST DOES NOT CONTAIN THE LOOSE SILICONE, AS MINE HAD MIGRATED TO MY LEFT AXILLA AREA AGAIN. SURGERY PROVED IT TO BE CAUSED BY RESIDUAL SILICONE IN THIS AREA FROM RUPTURE, AND INFILTRATED MY LYMPH NODES WHICH WERE CALCIFIED AND REMOVED. IN 2002, 6 YEARS LATER, I HAD A 5.5CC CANCEROUS TUMOR REMOVED FROM THE EXACT SAME AXILLA AREA AS PRIOR. THE TUMOR HAD SILICONE IN IT, WAS CLASSIFIED AS A RARE LIPOSARCOMA. THE ONCOLOGIST AND MY DOCTORS, SURGEON ALL AGREED THIS WAS NOT A COINCIDENCE THAT I HAD A MALIGNANT TUMOR IN THE EXACT AREA RESIDUAL SILICONE HAD BEEN FOUND YEARS PRIOR. I HAVE NO HISTORY OF CANCER OR TUMORS IN MY FAMILY OR ANY AUTO-IMMUNE DISEASE WHICH I NOW SUFFER SINCE I WILL ALWAYS HAVE THE LOOSE SILICONE WHICH WAS NOT ABLE TO BE REMOVED. THIS CAUSES A PERMANENT ""INFLAMMATORY"" RESPONSE IN THE BODY. I NOW WILL ALWAYS HAVE TO BE SCREENED FOR CANCER DUE TO THE TUMOR. I HAD BEEN A HEALTHY, ATHLETIC GIRL WHEN MY SILICONE IMPLANTS WERE PUT IN MY BODY. I AM NOW A ""SURVIVOR"" OF THE FALSE INFO GIVEN AND WHICH IS STILL BEING PUT OUT. THREE YEARS IS NOT ENOUGH TIME TO STUDY WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS. MINE DID NOT RUPTURE FOR 9 YEARS, AND THE SYMPTOMS WERE SUBTLE AND SLOW IN THE BEGINNING. I AM NOT AN UNUSUAL CASE. THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF OTHERS JUST LIKE ME WITH NO PRIOR ILLNESS WHO ARE NOW SUFFERING PERMANENT ILLNESS DUE TO LOOSE SILICONE IN THEIR BODIES. IF I HAD KNOWN ALL THE RESEARCH AND TRUTH REGARDING SILICONE IN THE BODY, I WOULD NEVER HAVE HAD PLACED THEM IN MY BODY.

ALL TOGETHER I HAVE BEEN IN SEVERE WIDE SPREAD BURNING PAIN EVERYDAY FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS, NAUSEA, WEIGHT LOSS, HAIR FALLING OUT, I'VE BEEN SO ILL THAT I LOST A JOB AND FELT LIKE I WAS GOING TO DIE BEFORE THEY FIND OUT WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME. IN 2007, I NOTICED MY RIGHT IMPLANT FELT A LITTLE TIGHTER THAN THE LEFT. AND AS TIME WENT ON IT CONTINUED TO GET HARDER AND BECAME VERY PAINFUL AND ROUND AND HARD. IN 2008 I SAW A PLASTIC SURGEON, AND HE SAID THEY HAD TO COME OUT. HE SAID HE THOUGHT THEY PROBABLY HAD BEEN LEAKING, BUT HE SAID THERE WASN'T ENOUGH RESEARCH ON THE SUBJECT TO KNOW IF I WOULD EVER GET BETTER EVEN THOUGH WE ARE REMOVING THEM.  I'M NOT TOO SURE HOW MUCH LONGER I CAN TOLERATE THIS PAIN. I AM IN VERY POOR HEALTH AND I WILL NOT LIVE LIKE THIS FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. I'D JUST AS SOON KILL MYSELF, ACCORDING TO ALL THE TESTS I AM IN GOOD HEALTH, HOWEVER IF YOU SAW ME YOU WOULD KNOW I AM VERY SICK. LAST YEAR I LOST DOWN TO 95 LBS. MY USUAL WEIGHT IS 150LBS.

1327202|1067509|D|1||"IN 2007, I WAS SCHEDULED FOR A CT SCAN OF THE CHEST TO RECHECK A LUNG NODULE AND MY ROUTINE YEARLY MAMMOGRAM AT RADIOLOGY. AFTER FILLING OUT THE REQUIRED HISTORY FORMS, NOTING THAT MY IMPLANTS WERE 27 YEARS OLD, THE CT SCAN WAS PERFORMED FIRST, THEN MAMMOGRAM. DURING THE MAMMOGRAM OF MY LEFT BREAST, WHILE THE BREAST WAS COMPRESSED, THE MACHINE DID NOT TAKE THE PICTURE AND THE BREAST HAD TO BE REPOSITIONED. THIS MAMMOGRAM OF BOTH BREASTS WAS MORE PAINFUL THAN PREVIOUS ONES. I WAITED FOR MY RESULTS. IT WAS REPORTED TO ME THAT DAY BY M.D. THAT EVERYTHING LOOKED NORMAL AND TO HAVE A HAPPY, HEALTHY YEAR. THE NEXT MORNING A REPRESENTATIVE CALLED AND SAID, THEY NEEDED FOR ME TO COME BACK IN FOR FURTHER TESTING - GIVING ME NO EXPLANATION. I WENT IN THAT DAY AND THEY PERFORMED AN ULTRASOUND AND IT WAS REPORTED TO ME THAT BOTH OF MY IMPLANTS WERE RUPTURED, BUT NOT TO WORRY BECAUSE THERE WAS A CAPSULE AROUND THE IMPLANTS THAT WOULD HOLD THE SILICONE IN PLACE AND TO SEE MY NORMAL DOCTOR. I CALLED MY DR. AND IT WAS ADVISED THAT I HAVE A MRI. THAT WAS PERFORMED TEN DAYS LATER. WHEN I WAS FINISHED WITH THAT I ASKED THE TECH. IF I COULD GO IN AND SPEAK WITH ONE OF THE DOCTORS, THAT I HAD QUESTIONS AND NEEDED A REFERRAL OF WHO TO GO TO THAT SPECIALIZES IN THIS. SHE WENT IN AND CAME OUT WITH A PIECE OF PAPER WITH 2 DOCTORS NAMES ON IT--THAT'S IT! IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT THE LUNG CT PERFORMED MINUTES BEFORE THE MAMMOGRAM STATES THAT ""BILATERAL BREAST IMPLANTS NOTED WITHOUT CHANGE"". HAD PREVIOUS CT SCANS OF LUNG IN 2003 & 2004. IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT THE SILICONE HAD INDEED BEEN SQUASHED BEYOND THE CAPSULE IN BOTH BREASTS AS NOTED IN THE MRI ""BILATERAL IMPLANT RUPTURES WITH EXTRACAPSULAR SILICONE SUPERIOR TO THE RIGHT BREAST IMPLANT AND MEDIAL TO THE LEFT BREAST IMPLANT"". MY QUESTION IS - IF YOU KNOW THERE ARE WOMEN OUT THERE WITH SILICONE IMPLANTS THAT ARE 20+ YEARS OLD AND NOW YOU SAY ARE BOUND TO RUPTURE - AND WE WERE TOLD THAT MANY YEARS AGO THAT THEY WERE EXPECTED TO LAST A LIFETIME - WHY AREN'T YOU INFORMING THEM OF THIS PRIOR TO A MAMMOGRAM OR OFFERING ALTERNATIVE DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES THAT ARE LESS TRAUMATIC? I KNOW THAT YOU WRITE THAT THE POTENTIAL RISK OF RUPTURE OR LEAKAGE NEEDS TO BE WEIGHTED AGAINST THE BENEFITS OF MAMMOGRAPHY BY EACH INDIVIDUAL WOMAN, BUT IN LIGHT OF THE RESEARCH THAT YOU HAVE WITH THE AGING OF IMPLANTS AND THEIR LIFE EXPECTANCY, COMBINED WITH THE FACT YOU KNOW MANY OF THESE RUPTURES DURING MAMMOGRAMS GO UNREPORTED TO YOU, IT WOULD SEEM YOUR GUIDELINES NEED TO BE RECONSIDERED! THE SIDE EFFECTS I HAD TO ENDURE FROM THE SILICONE LEACHING OUT INTO MY SYSTEM WAS NOT A PLEASANT EXPERIENCE, COMPOUNDED BY THE FACILITY BRUSHING ME OFF TO FIND MY OWN WAY AND MY INSURANCE COMPANY REFUSING MY CLAIM - ALL NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED. I KNOW I STILL HAVE TO WORRY IF THIS SILICONE IS GOING TO HARM ME FURTHER. I AM AWARE THAT THESE FACILITIES JUST SAY THAT IT CANNOT BE PROVEN THAT THEY INDEED RUPTURED THESE WOMENS IMPLANTS - BUT I INDEED CAN D/T THE CT SCAN PRIOR TO THE MAMMOGRAM.

2358522|16921874|D|1||"I WAS IMPLANTED IN 2005 AND EXPLANTED 2 MONTHS AGO. BEFORE GETTING IMPLANTS, I ASKED MY PLASTIC SURGEON WHAT COMPLICATIONS COULD OCCUR. HE SIMPLY SAID CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR THEY COULD RUPTURE OR LEAK. AND IF THEY LEAKED, IT WOULD ONLY LEAK SALINE INTO MY BODY AND IF THE SCAR CAPSULES GOT HARD, THE DR WOULD SIMPLY TAKE THE IMPLANTS OUT. WHEN I ASKED IF MOLD, FUNGUS, OR BACTERIA COULD GROW IN MY IMPLANTS, BECAUSE IT IS IN A MOIST ENCLOSED DARK AREA JUST SITTING THERE, HE SAID ABSOLUTELY NOT! HE SAID THE REASON WAS THE WATER WILL BE IN A CLOSED, STERILE ENVIRONMENT. I ASKED MY PLASTIC SURGEON ABOUT ALL THE WOMEN WHO HAD FILED LAW SUITS WHO SAID THEY HAD IMMUNE DISORDERS ISSUES. HE SAID STUDIES HAVE FOUND THOSE WOMEN HAD PREDISPOSED MEDICAL ISSUES, AND THOSE WERE WOMEN WITH SILICONE IMPLANTS. THESE WERE SALINE, AND THEREFORE COULDN'T HARM ME. I WAS ALSO NEVER TOLD IF FOR SOME REASON I HAD TO GET MY IMPLANTS REMOVED, MY BREASTS WOULD OR COULD LOOK DEFORMED. I COULD NOT MAKE AN INFORMED CHOICE ABOUT GETTING IMPLANTS BECAUSE I WAS ONLY TOLD THE PRETTY ABOUT THE IMPLANTS: HOW IT WOULD ENHANCE MY FIGURE AND BALANCE ME OUT. IF I HAD KNOWN I COULD GET SICK, I WOULD NEVER HAVE GOTTEN THE IMPLANTS. I WAS NEVER GIVEN THE BOOKLET ON THE FDA WEB SITE, WHICH THE FDA SUPPOSEDLY REQUIRES TO BE GIVEN TO EACH PT. I WAS JUST SOLD THE BEAUTIFUL STORY OF THE GLORIFIED SALINE BREAST IMPLANT, WHICH I BOUGHT HOOK, LINE, AND SINKER. BEFORE MY IMPLANTS, I HAD RUN 3 MARATHONS, 4 HALF MARATHONS, AND MANY 5K'S. ABOUT 3 - 4 YEARS AFTER GETTING MY IMPLANTS, I GOT VERY SICK. I COULD NOT WORK OUT ANYMORE. MY HAIR WAS FALLING OUT, MEMORY ISSUES, I HAD TERRIBLE FATIGUE, AND ACHES AND PAINS IN MY KNEES, HIPS, NECK AND BACK. I WAS BLOATED, HAD FREQUENT FEVERS RESULTING IN CHILLS AND SHAKES, THROWING UP, CONSTIPATION, VAGINITIS, CANDIDA ISSUES WHICH WAS SHOWING UP IN MY BLOOD AND SINUSES. ONE OF THE SCARY THINGS THAT WOULD OCCUR WAS THAT THERE WERE TIMES MY STOMACH WAS SO INFLAMED, MY FOOD WOULD JUST SIT AND NOT DIGEST. THIS WOULD CAUSE MY HEART TO RACE AND MY BODY TO SHAKE. I WOULD HAVE TO THROW IT UP IN ORDER TO FEEL BETTER AGAIN. I MISSED A LOT OF WORK. THANK GOODNESS I WORK FOR A FABULOUS COMPANY. WHEN MY IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED, I HAD ASPERGILUS NIGER AND FUNGUS. I STILL HAVE SOME FUNGAL ISSUES, BUT I AM 80% BETTER THAN I WAS! I HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO WORK OUT FOR A YEAR AND A HALF, WHEREAS THANKS TO GOD, I CAN NOW WEIGHT TRAIN AND WORK OUT ON THE ELLIPTICAL. I HAVE SPENT (B)(6) IN THE PAST 2 YEARS ON DOCTORS, MEDICATIONS AND PROCEDURES JUST TO GET BETTER. I HAD THOUGHT MY IMPLANTATION WOULD ONLY COST (B)(6). I DON'T KNOW HOW OFTEN THESE KINDS OF HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE CAUSED BY BREAST IMPLANTS IN OTHERS, BUT GUESS WHAT, NEITHER DOES ANYONE IN THIS ROOM. THE REASON WE DON'T KNOW, IS BECAUSE THE STUDIES HAVE ASKED THE WRONG QUESTIONS. I DON'T THINK THIS IS COINCIDENTAL. I THINK WHEN IMPLANT COMPANIES AND PLASTIC SURGEONS PAY FOR OR CONDUCT STUDIES ON BREAST IMPLANTS, THEY ASK QUESTIONS WHICH MAKE IMPLANTS SEEM SAFE. I'M HERE TO SAY IT IS TIME TO FIND OUT WHAT THE REAL RISKS ARE OF BREAST IMPLANTS, INCLUDING SALINE AND SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS. MEANWHILE, EVEN IF DOCTORS THINK THE KINDS OF PROBLEMS I HAD ARE RARE, IT SHOULD BE MANDATORY FOR DOCTORS TO DISCLOSE TO POTENTIAL PTS THAT SOME WOMEN GET VERY SICK FROM THEIR IMPLANTS. WHY ISN'T THERE A WARNING LABEL ON BREAST IMPLANTS LIKE THERE ARE ON MOST EVERY OTHER DRUG OR MEDICAL PROCEDURE/SURGERY OUT THERE? I KNOW THE TRUTH, BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE AND ALSO BECAUSE I HAVE TALKED TO MANY OTHER WOMEN WITH SIMILAR EXPERIENCES WITH THEIR IMPLANTS. IT IS TIME FOR THE FDA TO REQUIRE STUDIES OF WOMEN WHO ARE SICK FROM THEIR IMPLANTS TO SEE IF THEY RECOVER WHEN THEIR IMPLANTS ARE REMOVED. ONCE I FIGURED OUT MY IMPLANTS WERE THE CAUSE OF MY SICKNESS, I JOINED A COUPLE OF ONLINE FORUMS TO SEEK OTHER WOMEN WHO WERE EXPERIENCING THE SAME THING. IT WAS AMAZING HOW MANY WOMEN ALL HAD SIMILAR REACTIONS AND HEALTH PROBLEMS -- (B)(6). THERE ARE A LOT OF US OUT THERE. MANY OF THESE WOMEN WEREN'T AS LUCKY AS I WAS, BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T AFFORD TO GET THEIR IMPLANTS REMOVED. INSTEAD, THESE LADIES ARE GETTING SICKER AND SICKER. SOME HAVE DIED, SOME HAVE ORGANS SHUTTING DOWN, MAKING THEM TOO SICK FOR SURGERY. AND SOME HAVE COMMITTED SUICIDE. I WONDER HOW MANY WOMEN HAVE COMMITTED SUICIDE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THEM AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO GET BETTER. ALMOST ALL THE WOMEN HAD SIMILAR STORIES WITH THEIR PLASTIC SURGEON DENYING BREAST IMPLANTS CAUSE SUCH PROBLEMS. THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY SO MANY WOMEN GOT SICKER AND SICKER, GOING TO DR AFTER DR TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS WRONG SINCE THEY WERE TOLD IMPLANTS WERE NOT THE CAUSE OF THEIR SYMPTOMS. I AM ASKING YOU TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, SO THAT OTHER WOMEN WON'T GO THROUGH THIS. THERE ARE DOCTORS WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO HELP THEIR IMPLANT PTS SO THEY FEED THEM ANTIDEPRESSANTS. EVEN IF WOMEN ARE TOLD THEIR IMPLANTS WILL NOT LAST A LIFETIME, THEY DON'T REALIZE THIS MEANS MANY IMPLANTS LAST ONLY 10 YEARS. AND MAMMOGRAPHY TECHS HAVE TOLD ME THEY ARE TOLD IMPLANTS ONLY LAST 5 - 6 YEARS. I PLEAD WITH YOU TO NOT IGNORE THIS GROWING EPIDEMIC OF WOMEN WITH AGING IMPLANTS AND SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS. NOT EVERYONE GETS SICK, BUT THOSE OF US WHO DO PAY DEARLY. PLEASE USE MY EXAMPLE TO ADVISE THE FDA THEY SHOULD NOT BE USING SALINE IMPLANT PTS AS A ""CONTROL GROUP"" TO STUDY THE RISKS OF SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LOCAL COMPLICATIONS ARE SIMILAR FOR ALL BREAST IMPLANTS, AND EVEN THE AUTOIMMUNE SYMPTOMS CAN BE SIMILAR. STUDIES COMPARING SILICONE PTS TO SALINE PTS MIGHT CONCLUDE THEY DON'T DIFFER, BUT IT DOES NOT MEAN EITHER TYPE OF IMPLANT IS SAFE. STUDIES SHOULD COMPARE IMPLANT PTS TO WOMEN WHO DO NOT HAVE IMPLANTS, TO FIND OUT HOW MANY ARE LIKELY TO BE SERIOUSLY HARMED AFTER 5 YEARS, 10 YEARS, OR 20 YEARS. WHAT IS TRULY SAD IS I HAVE HAD SEVERAL WOMEN CONTACT ME SINCE JUNE OF THIS YEAR WHO ARE EXTREMELY SICK FROM THEIR SILICONE AND SALINE IMPLANTS... ONE IS A STATE ATTORNEY WHO IS IN..."|INAMED/MCGHAN|25-68421|11/22/2011||||Y|||0HP|FWM|1.0||BREAST IMPLANT SALINE||68-420|||SANTA BARBARA|US|MCGHAN|93111|CA|93111||||True

1998794|20917661|D|1||I HAVE SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS AFTER HAVING RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY FOLLOWING A BREAST CANCER BILATERAL MASTECTOMY. AT THE END OF (B)(6) 2010, I VISITED (B)(6). THE WEATHER WAS EXTREMELY COLD, -16 DEGREES IN THE EVENINGS. AS THE DRIVE INTO THE MOUNTAINS CLIMBED IN ELEVATION FROM (B)(6), I BEGAN TO HAVE SHALLOW BREATHING. I REMAINED CLAM AND KEPT MY BREATHING SLOW TO AVOID PANIC. WHEN I GOT OUT OF THE CAR, MY MOVEMENTS WERE EXTREMELY SLOW AND RESTRICTED. I FELT IT NECESSARY TO PAY ATTENTION TO MY BREATH, THE SHALLOWNESS WAS VERY PRESENT WITH HEAVINESS IN MY CHEST, AND I COULD NOT FILL MY LUNGS AS I NORMALLY COULD. THROUGHOUT THE NEXT TWO DAYS, I WAS RESTRICTED IN MOVEMENT IN THAT I COULD NOT BREATHE TO COMPLETE NORMAL DAILY TASKS. WALKING ACROSS THE ROOM CAUSED ME TO STOP AND CATCH MY BREATH. MY FAMILY AND I TREATED THIS SYMPTOM AS ALTITUDE SICKNESS. I HAVE NEVER HAD ALTITUDE SICKNESS WITH ANY PRIOR VISITS TO (B)(6). MY LAST VISIT WAS (B)(6) 2010 WITH NO SYMPTOMS WHAT SO EVER. I CONTEMPLATED, MANY TIMES, IF I SHOULD GO TO THE ER BUT KEPT FAITH IN THAT IT WOULD SUBSIDE BY DRINKING WATER AS IF IT REALLY WERE ALTITUDE SICKNESS. AS INTENSE HEADACHE DEVELOPED THAT ENVELOPED MY ENTIRE CRANIUM. I DO NOT HAVE ISSUES WITH HEADACHES, CERTAINLY NOT ONE THIS INTENSE. I FELT HANDICAPPED. I AM NOT HANDICAPPED. I AM A NORMALLY FUNCTIONING HEALTHY CAPABLE WOMAN WHOSE BREATH WAS COMPROMISED BY PRESSURE IN THE CHEST. MY IMPLANTS WERE TIGHTER THAN NORMAL, LARGER AS IF THEY WERE SWOLLEN. ON THE DRIVE BACK TO (B)(6), THERE WAS A POINT WHERE MY BREATH RETURNED TO NORMAL. IT WAS ABOUT THE SAME AREA WHERE IT WAS SHORTENED ON THE WAY UP. TO SAY I WAS RELIEVED I COULD BREATHE NORMALLY AGAIN IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. A SHORT WHILE LATER, I NOTICED A LOUD SLOSHING SOUND IN MY IMPLANTS. THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED SINCE THEY WERE PUT IN (B)(6) 2007. THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT WOULD RESULT IN A LOUD PROMINENT SLOSHING SOUND THAT COULD BE HEARD BY OTHERS IN THE ROOM. THEIR FORM REMAINED NORMAL. I COULDN'T TELL IF THE NOISE WAS COMING FROM INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF THE IMPLANT. THE SKIN AROUND THE IMPLANT SEEMED NORMAL AS WELL. I WAS UP ALL NIGHT EVALUATING IF THEY WERE LEAKING OR NOT. I FOUND IT ODD THAT THEY WOULD BOTH LEAK BUT THE NOISES CAME EQUALLY FROM BOTH SIDES. WITHIN A 24 HOUR TIME SPAN, THE NOISES WERE JUST ABOUT GONE. THERE ISN'T A DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT MY IMPLANTS REACTED TO THE INTENSE COLD AND THE ELEVATION OF THE AREA I VISITED. I CANNOT RETURN TO (B)(6) IN FEAR THIS WILL HAPPEN AGAIN.

2163607|2106125|D|1||"I'M WRITING MY STORY TO THE FDA. THIS IS ABOUT MY BREAST SILICONE IMPLANTS THAT HAVE BEEN BLEEDING OUT FOR 7 OR MORE YEARS. I STARTED TO CONTINUALLY TO BE SICK WITH SYMPTOMS LIKE: LOW GRADE FEVERS 99.6 TO 100.8 (ALL THE TIME), FATIGUE, SWOLLEN LYMPH NODES, FLU-LIKE SYMPTOMS, NIGHT SWEATS, INSOMNIA, BACKACHES, WEIGHT LOSS, WEIGHT GAIN, BONES HURTING, CANKER SORES IN MY MOUTH FOR 4 MONTHS AND ON AND OFF FOR 2 YEARS, LARGE SUB LINGUAL TONSILS, COUGHING, WEAKNESS, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, CHEST PAINS, PAIN DEEP IN THE BONES, MEMORY LOSS. UNTIL (B)(6) 2007, WHEN MY BLOOD PRESSURE WENT UP AND I STARTED GETTING CHEST PAINS, THEN I SAW MY CARDIOLOGIST. HE RAN ALL THE TESTS, ECHO, THALLIUM TREADMILL AND BP MONITOR WITH BLOOD TESTS. ALL THE TESTS CAME BACK NEGATIVE EXCEPT FOR MY CRP, IT WAS 20.6. THIS HAD MY CARDIOLOGIST CONCERNED. HE ASKED THAT I RETURNED IN 2 MONTHS FOR A REPEAT TEST TO SEE IF IT WAS STILL HIGH 20.1. IN (B)(6), THE TEST WAS REPEATED WITH THE SAME RESULT 20.1. SENT ME FOR A CHEST CT SCAN. CAME BACK ABNORMAL AGAIN. MY CT SHOWED MANY SPOTS WITH INFILTRATES IN BOTH LUNGS AND PATCHY SPOTS WITH ABNORMAL LYMPH NODES. HE REFERRED ME TO A PULMONOLOGIST; SHE SAID I NEED A LYMPH NODE BIOPSY IN MY AXILLARY'S NODES, WANTED TO R/O LYMPHOMA. SHE HAD MORE BLOOD TEST DONE AND MY CPR WAS UP TO 43 AND SED RATE WAS UP, WBC WAS UP, BLOOD WORK IS STARTING TO COME BACK ABNORMAL. SHE REFERRED ME TO A GENERAL SURGEON TO PERFORM THE BIOPSY AND THE BIOPSY CAME BACK SHOWING SILICONE IN THE LYMPH NODES AND ALSO IN MY MEDIA-STERNUM FROM THE LAST BIOPSY. THE DOCTORS ARE NOW SAYING THIS HAS BEEN LEAKING INTO SYSTEM SLOWLY SINCE BEFORE 2004 AND MY AUTOIMMUNE SYSTEM HAS BEEN FIGHTING, WHICH IS WHY I HAVE BEEN SO SICK. WELL, THE 1ST SURGERY WAS ON (B)(6) 2007. THE INCISIONS ARE ABOUT 3IN ON BOTH SIDE OF MY PELVIC AREA. THIS SURGERY WILL BE DIVIDING THE INFERIOR EPIGASTRIC BLOOD VESSELS, TRAINING THE TRAM TISSUES TO RELY ON THE SUPERIOR EPIGASTRIC SYSTEM. THIS STEP IS NOT REQUIRED FOR SUCCESSFUL PEDICLE TRAM RECONSTRUCTION BUT CAN IMPROVE BLOOD SUPPLY TO THE FLAP. SO-CALLED DELAY PROCEDURES MAY EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY OF PERFORMING MICROSURGERY (""SUPERCHARGING"") IF THE PEDICLE FLAP HAS ANY ARTERIAL OR VENOUS INSUFFICIENCY PROBLEMS, SINCE THE VESSELS DIVIDED IN THE ""DELAY"" CANNOT BE USED. IT IS INFECTING MY LUNGS AND IMMUNE SYSTEM AND OTHER MAJOR ORGANS. IN ALL I HAD A MINIMUM OF 13 MAJOR SURGERIES WHICH INCLUDE MORE RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY AND WOUND CARE, DEVELOP NECROSIS FROM THE SURGERY, ALL THE SILICONE COULD NOT BE REMOVED. I HAD DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH AND THERE IS VERY LITTLE ABOUT MY CONDITION AND SILICONE ILLNESS. BOTH THE SURGEON AND PLASTIC SURGEON HAVE SAID THIS IS A VERY RARE CONDITION. ON (B)(6) 2007, BILATERAL PEDICLES TRAM FLAP WITH THE REMOVAL OF SILICONE IMPLANTS. BOTH IMPLANTS WERE RUPTURED AND BLEEDING OUT, MORE ON THE LEFT THEN ON THE RIGHT SIDE. BUT THE PLASTIC SURGEON -PS- SAID THESE HAVE BEEN LEAKING FOR A LONG TIME. THE PS CLEANED ALL THE AREA WHILE NOT TO DISTURB THE BLOOD VESSEL FOR THE TRAM FLAPS. THE PS USED THE SKIN OF THE BREASTS FROM WHERE HE REMOVED THE IMPLANTS AND TRANSPLANTED THE FLAPS BILATERALLY TO KEEP ME THE SAME SIZE AND SYMMETRICALLY. THE ABDOMEN REPAIR ""TUMMY TUCK"". THERE HAS BEEN SOME BRUISING AROUND THE ""NEW PLACEMENT"" OF THE BELLY BUTTON AND ABDOMEN AROUND THERE. THE PS USED MESH FOR MY ABDOMEN INSTEAD OF ALLODERM, BECAUSE THE MESH WAS STRONGER. I CAN FEEL THAT MESH WHEN I WALK. I WAS IN SURGERY FOR 8 1/2 HOURS AND SUFFERED RESPIRATORY FAILURE WITH PULMONARY EDEMA WITHIN THE FIRST 24 HOURS. I WAS MOVED TO THE FLOOR AND DEVELOPED PNEUMONIA IN THE RIGHT LOWER LOBE. I SWEAR, I WAS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT BASED ON BREATHING. ANTIBIOTICS PUSH AND LASIX PUSH AND PLENTY OF RESPIRATORY THERAPY, WHEN I GOT HOME I HAD EXTRA EQUIPMENT OXYGEN, WALKER, AND HOSPITAL BED. I WAS ON A LOT OF ANTIBIOTICS AND PAIN PILLS. I WENT TO THE DOCTOR AND IT LOOKS LIKE I'M GOING TO BE ADMITTED BACK INTO THE HOSPITAL ON (B)(6) 2008 FOR MORE SURGERY FOR A WOUND THAT DEVELOPED IN THE ABDOMEN. THE SURGERY IS FOR DEBRIDEMENT OF THE WOUND THAT IS NOT HEALING AND PLACING A WOUND VAC ON IT. THE DOCTOR WILL HAVE TO REDO 8 INCHES OF THE INCISION. I WILL BE IN THE HOSPITAL FOR 2-3 DAYS; I WILL HAVE TO PRAY MORE. THE SURGERY IS SUPPOSED TO TAKE 1 TO 1 1/2 HOUR; WITH THE COMPLICATIONS OF MY LUNGS THAT TIME SHOULDN'T BE TOO BAD. I WAS AFRAID OF DEVELOPING INFECTION, (B)(6). THEN 6 WEEKS OF THE WOUND VAC ON MY ABDOMEN. I DID DEVELOP (B)(6) AND WAS HOSPITALIZE FOR 4 MONTHS IN 2008. I HAVE STARTED TO SEE THE TRANSPLANTATION TEAM TO HAVE A POSSIBLE LUNG REMOVED BEFORE I RUN OUT OF TIME. BOTH LUNGS ARE FILLED WITH SILICONE, AS WELL AS MY KIDNEYS, AND MY GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT. MY PULMONARY DOCTOR I HAVE HAS BEEN WITH ME FOR 4 YEARS, AND SHE HAS SEEN ME GET WORSE THROUGH ON-GOING TESTS AND YEARS. WITH THE LUNG BIOPSIES (B)(6) 2011, SHOWING SILICONE THROUGHOUT MY LUNGS, SHE THEN SAW MY LAST PFTS AND IT WAS WORSE BY 80% SINCE (B)(6) 2011, AND MY O2 LEVEL IS AT 7 LITERS NOW. IT HAS GONE UP BY 3 LITERS SINCE (B)(6) 2010. SO CURRENTLY, I AM GOING THROUGH THE PRE-TESTING FOR LUNG TRANSPLANTS TO SEE IF I QUALIFY FOR THE TRANSPLANTS. SO I HAVE TO GO THROUGH A LOT OF TESTING TO SEE IF MY BODY CAN HANDLE THE TRANSPLANTS. ONLY MY DOCTOR UNDERSTANDS EVERYTHING ABOUT WHAT IMPLANTS CAN DO TO YOU. SHE HAS SEEN ME GO THROUGH IT A LOT. WHEN MY IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED IN 2007, THE DOCTOR HAD TO LEAVE THE OUTER PART IN BECAUSE MY TISSUE WAS ALREADY TAKEN OVER. MY IMPLANTS HAD BEEN LEAKING UP TO 7 YEARS PER THE TIMELINE OF ALL THE ISSUE WITH MY HEALTH PER MY DOCTORS. I HOPE THE LUNG TRANSPLANTS WILL BE APPROVE TO PLACE ME ON THE ORGAN TRANSPLANT LIST. SILICONE IMPLANTS SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL MORE AND NEW UPDATED RESEARCH IS DONE. PLEASE, I BEG YOU TO LISTEN."|MENTOR||07/11/2011||12/04/2007||R|||0|FTR|1.0||BREAST IMPLANTS|||||||MENTOR|||||MENTOR||True

BECAUSE THE LEFT PROSTHESIS INVOLVED IN THIS COMPLAINT WILL NOT BE RETURNED TO MENTOR, PE WAS PRECLUDED FROM EVALUATING THE DEVICE. BASED ON THE LABORATORY EVAL, PE CONCLUDED THE RIGHT DEFLATION WAS MOST LIKELY DUE TO THE RENT THAT MEASURED APPROX .1 CM IN LENGTH, WITHIN THE CREASE, ON THE POSTERIOR ASPECT OF THE DEVICE. A MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION OF THE EDGES OF THE RENT REVEALED A TAPERED WEAR PATTERN. TAPER WEAR IS CHARACTERISTIC OF A CREASE/FOLD FAILURE. A CREASE/FOLD FAILURE IS A KNOWN INHERENT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF SALINE-FILLED MAMMARY PROSTHESES AND MAY BE THE RESULT OF ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: UNDERINFLATION OR OVERINFLATION OF THE DEVICE, CONTINUOUS AND SUSTAINED STRESSES TO THE DEVICE - SUCH AS CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR TOO SMALL A BREAST POCKET, AND FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE SHELL IN THE BREAST POCKET.

2465563|14928426|D|1||I LIVE IN (B)(6) AND HAD BREAST AUGMENTATION SURGERY IN 2003. I HAVE BEEN ILL FOR SOME TIME, MY SYMPTOMS INCLUDE MUSCLE LOSS (MASS AND TONE), WEIGHT LOSS, HAIR LOSS, SLURRED SPEECH, TOTAL SKIN RASH AND SORENESS, BLURRED VISION, FATIGUE, JOINT AND MUSCLE PAIN, LOSS OF COORDINATION AND DEPRESSION. AT NO TIME DID I MAKE A LINK TO MY BREAST IMPLANTS AS I THOUGHT I WAS SUFFERING SYMPTOMS OF STRESS. HOWEVER, DUE TO RECENTLY ACCELERATED MUSCLE LOSS AND SKIN PROBLEMS, ALONG WITH INCREASED PAIN IN MY CHEST AND NECK, I TRIED TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS TO SEE MY PRIVATE SURGEON AT (B)(6) WHICH TOOK ME THREE MONTHS TO SECURE. I HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT AT LEAST ONE OF MY INAMED SILICONE IMPLANTS HAD RUPTURED (NOW VERY SMALL AND DEFORMED) AND THAT THE GEL HAS INFLAMED MY LYMPH NODES. I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME CONNECTION BETWEEN MY SYMPTOMS WHICH HAVE PERSISTED AND GRADUALLY WORSENED FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS NOW - EXCEPT FOR RECENT HEIGHTENED CHEST PAINS WHICH PROMPTED ME TO CONTACT MY SURGERY PROVIDER. I NOW HAVE THE ADDED STRESS OF KNOWING THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG, AND THAT THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT DAMAGE MAY BE BEING DONE TO MY BODY, SO PERHAPS SOME MEDICAL MONITORING WOULD KEEP US ALL INFORMED? AS IT STANDS, MY CURRENT SITUATION IS THAT THE (B)(6) WON'T REMOVE THE RUPTURED IMPLANT BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT LIABILITY LIES WITH THE PRIVATE PRACTICE WHO UNDERTOOK THE SURGERY. (B)(6), FROM WHOM I PURCHASED MY IMPLANTS, CANNOT HELP ME WITHOUT PAYMENT UP FRONT. AS I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO WORK FOR SOME TIME, I CANNOT AFFORD PRIVATE SURGERY COSTS. SO, FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, THE RUPTURED IMPLANT WILL HAVE TO STAY IN MY BODY. I WONDER IF THE FDA WOULD BE INTERESTED IN COLLECTING DATA FROM MY CURRENT HEALTH SITUATION FOR FUTURE REFERENCE IN REGARD TO ANY FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS OVER THE SAFETY OF SILICONE IMPLANTS. AS MY HEALTH SEEMS TO BE DETERIORATING FAST, AND THE IMPLANT REMAINS IN PLACE, PERHAPS MY BODY CAN PROVIDE THE PROOF TO LINK OR DISMISS THE DESTRUCTIVE EFFECTS OF SILICONE IMPLANTS IN HUMANS. I FEEL I MIGHT AS WELL USE MY CURRENT PREDICAMENT TOWARDS SOME GOOD USE AT LEAST. WORSE-CASE SCENARIO, IF WE START MONITORING NOW, WE MIGHT EVEN FIND OUT IF SILICONE LEAKAGE CAN OR DOES CONTRIBUTE TO EVENTUAL DEATH. IN THE MEANTIME, I HOPE THE (B)(6) MIGHT ALSO RAISE THE ETHICAL QUESTION, WHO, IF ANYONE IS LEGALLY AND FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE TO SAVE MY LIFE.|INAMED SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT|UNK|02/16/2012||||Y|||0|FTR|1.0||BREAST IMPLANT||UNK|||||INAMED CORP|||||UNK||True

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION SHOWED A SYMMETRICAL BREASTS WITH NO OVERLYING SKIN OR NIPPLE CHANGES. THERE WERE TWO LARGE MOBILE NODES PALPABLE IN THE LEFT AXILLA. INITIAL BREAST MAMMOGRAPHY AND ULTRASONOGRAPHY CONFIRMED LEFT AXILLARY LYMPHADENOPATHY BUT DID NOT SHOW ANY PERI-IMPLANT FLUID COLLECTION. BIOPSY OF THE LEFT AXILLARY MASS SHOWED FINDINGS CONSISTENT WITH CLASSIC HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA, NODULAR SCLEROSING TYPE. IT LACKED TWO TYPICAL STAINS-CD15 AND PAX5. PET-CT SHOWED A 5-CM AREA OF PET-AVID LEFT AXILLARY LYMPHADENOPATHY. HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA STAGE IA WAS DIAGNOSED. THE PT THEN HAD TWO CYCLES OF ADRIAMYCIN, BLEOMYCIN, VINBLASTINE, AND DACARBAZINE (ABVD) AND 2000 GY OF FIELD RADIATION TO THE LEFT AXILLA. HER INITIAL TREATMENT WAS COMPLETED IN (B)(6) 2011. F/U CT SCAN IN (B)(6) 2011, SHOWED A DECREASE IN THE SIZE OF THE LEFT AXILLARY LYMPHADENOPATHY. UNILATERAL FLUID COLLECTION, HOWEVER, WAS NOTED AROUND THE LEFT BREAST IMPLANT (FIGURE). THE FLUID INCREASED IN SIZE AND SHE PRESENTED 6 MONTHS ALTER WITH LEAKAGE OF SEROUS FLUID FROM HER LEFT BREAST. CYTOLOGY OF THE PERI-IMPLANT FLUID SHOWED CD30+ LYMPHOMA CELLS OF INDETERMINATE LINEAGE. DIFFERENT DIAGNOSIS INCLUDED RECURRENT HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA OR IMPLANT-ASSOCIATED ANAPLASTIC LARGE-CELL LYMPHOMA. REPEAT PET-CT SHOWED PET-AVID AREAS ON BILATERAL AXILLARY LYMPH NODES. BOTH IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED WITH CAPSULECTOMIES. IN (B)(6) 2011, SHE REPEAT PET-CT SHOWED PET-AVID AREAS IN BILATERAL AXILLARY LYMPH NODES. BOTH IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED WITH CAPSULECTOMIES. IN (B)(6) 2011, SHE WAS TREATED WITH FOUR CYCLES OF SALVAGE CHEMOTHERAPY WITH GEMCITABINE AND CISPLATIN FOR ASSUMED RECURRENT HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA. F/U SONOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT BREAST 1 MONTH LATER SHOWED A HYPOECHOIC MASS. BIOPSY OF THE MASS SHOWED SIMILAR CELLS FROM THE PERI-IMPLANT FLUID, WHICH WERE CD30+ LYMPHOMA CELLS OF INDETERMINATE ORIGIN. THE MASS WAS RESECTED IN (B)(6) 2012, AND PATHOLOGICAL TESTS SHOWED (B)(6), SEROMA-ASSOCIATED (LARGE-CELL LYMPHOMA (ALK-NEGATIVE ALCL). A RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF ALL SIDES SHOWED LARGE CELLS CHARACTERISTIC OF ALK-NEGATIVE ALCL. SUBSTANTIAL OVERLAP IN MORPHOLOGY AND IMMUNOPHENOTYPE OF CELLS FROM THE INITIAL AXILLARY LYMPH NODE BIOPSY, THE PERI-IMPLANT FLUID AND THE FINAL LEFT BREAST MASS BIOPSY SUGGESTED THE SAME MANIFESTATIONS OF THE ALCL. THE PRESENTATION IS UNIQUE BECAUSE ALK-NEGATIVE ALCL PRESENTED WITH A PATHOLOGICAL AXILLARY LYMPH NODE INSTEAD OF THE TYPICAL PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA.

3161630|3489191|D|1||I HAD SILICONE IMPLANTS PLACED UNDER MY BREAST MUSCLE IN (B)(6) 2004. I HAD BREAST FED BOTH OF MY CHILDREN AND WANTED TO REPLACE THE VOLUME LOST AFTERWARDS. I MET WITH A PLASTIC SURGEON ABOUT MY OPTIONS AND HE SUGGESTED SILICONE IMPLANTS DUE TO THEIR SOFTNESS AND ABILITY TO FEEL MORE NATURAL THAN A SALINE IMPLANT. IN (B)(6) 2012 I BEGAN TO HAVE MEDICAL PROBLEMS. IT STARTED WITH THORACIC BACK PAIN THAT WAS INTENSE AND SEVERE. IT THEN RADIATED TO MY NECK, SHOULDERS AND CHEST AREA. I HAD NUMEROUS TESTS RUN ON ME AND NOTHING PROVED TO BE THE CAUSE FOR THE PAIN I WAS FEELING. I HAD MRIS, X-RAYS, BLOOD WORK, HAD EXTENSIVE PHYSICAL THERAPY, DEEP TISSUE MASSAGE AND ACUPRESSURE FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS. I HAD INJECTIONS AND VARIOUS MEDICATIONS GIVEN TO ME TO TRY AND HELP WITH THE PAIN. IT DID NOT HELP AND I CONTINUED TO WORE. I FELT LIKE SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH MY IMPLANTS AND PERHAPS THIS WAS THE CAUSE SINCE THIS CAME ON FROM NOWHERE AND HAD ALWAYS BEEN HEALTHY AND QUITE ACTIVE. THE SURGEON WHO PLACED THEM INSIDE ME BARELY EXAMINED ME AND TOLD ME IN (B)(6) 2012 THAT IT WAS NOT FROM MY IMPLANTS AND TO SEARCH ELSEWHERE. HE DID NOT REQUEST AN MRI OF MY IMPLANTS OR ANY ADDITIONAL TESTING. AT THIS POINT I AM BECOMING MORE AND MORE FATIGUED, I AM FEELING HARDNESS IN MY LYMPH NODES IN MY BREAST AREA, AND NECK AREA. I CAN BARELY MOVE AND HAVE NO ENERGY. I AM NO MISSING A LOT OF WORK DUE TO MY SUDDEN AND PROBLEMATIC HEALTH ISSUES. I CONTINUED TO SEARCH FOR THE CAUSE. I WENT TO (B)(6) BASED ON THIS DOCTOR TELLING ME TO LOOK ELSEWHERE. AFTER A YEAR OF THIS CONTINUED PAIN AND SWELLING AND NUMEROUS DOCTOR BILLS I WENT TO ANOTHER PLASTIC SURGEON FOR HIS OPINION. HE IMMEDIATELY TOLD ME THAT MY BREASTS WERE TOO LARGE AND THAT THEY DIDN'T LOOK RIGHT. HE SAID I SHOULD HAVE THEM REMOVED TO HELP ME IMPROVE MY HEALTH. I HAD THESE IMPLANTS REMOVED ON (B)(6) 2013 AND AFTERWARDS THE SURGEON TOLD ME THAT THE IMPLANTS HAD COMPLETELY RUPTURED AND THAT THE IMPLANTS HAD LEAKED THE SILICONE EVERYWHERE. HE SAID IT WAS ONE OF THE WORSE CASES HE HAD SEEN. MY RECOVERY HAS BEEN HORRIBLE. MY LYMPH NODES ARE TOTALLY SWOLLEN AND IT IS OBVIOUS AND VERY VISIBLE. MY BACK PAIN FROM THE TRAUMA OF THE REMOVAL OF THE LEAKED SILICONE HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE. I HAVE HAD A MAJOR WEIGHT GAIN WHICH APPEARS TO BE FROM FLUID RETENTION AND MY LYMPHATIC SYSTEM APPEARS TO NOT BE WORKING PROPERLY. I NOW HAVE TO MEET WITH AN AUTOIMMUNE SPECIALIST TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING ON SINCE NO OTHER DIAGNOSIS HAS BEEN DETERMINED. I HAVE NOW LOST MY JOB DUE TO MY FAILING HEALTH AND TRULY FEEL IT IS BECAUSE OF THE RUPTURED SILICONE THAT HAD BEEN LEAKED INTO MY BODY EVERYWHERE. I HAD BEEN DISMISSED BY THE ORIGINAL SURGEON WHEN CLEARLY HE SHOULD HAVE REQUESTED AN MRI WHICH WOULD HAVE SHOWN THE RUPTURED IMPLANTS. INSTEAD I WENT ANOTHER YEAR IN MAJOR PAIN WHEN MY IMPLANTS HAD LEAKED. MY NORMAL PHYSICIAN ALSO BELIEVES THERE IS AN AUTOIMMUNE ISSUE GOING ON WITH ME DUE TO THE IMPLANTS. MY LIFE HAS BEEN DRASTICALLY AFFECTED IN MANY WAYS. IT HAS DESTROYED MY HEALTH, CAREER, PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS AND HAS FINANCIALLY DEVASTATED ME. I AM DISGUSTED THAT THE ORIGINAL SURGEON DID NOT STEP UP TO HELP DIAGNOSE THE POSSIBILITY THAT MY IMPLANTS HAD RUPTURED AND WAS CAUSING ME TO BE SICK. AT THE VERY LEAST HE SHOULD HAVE REQUESTED OR SUGGESTED THAT IN (B)(6) 2012. MY BREASTS LOOKED DEFORMED AND WERE TOO BIG AND THIS WAS VERIFIED BY MY OTHER SURGEON.

(B)(6) 2013 I REPORTED A PROBLEM TO DOCTOR (B)(6) THE PHYSICIAN WHO PERFORMED THE SURGERY THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM. I SPENT 1.5 HOURS IN HIS OFFICE EXPLAINING SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH THE RIGHT BREAST IMPLANT, I HAD PAIN IN MY RIGHT ARMPIT, THE IMPLANT FELT LOOSE AND NOT THE SAME CONSISTENCY AS THE OTHER. (THIS IS MY THIRD SET OF IMPLANTS, IT FELT DIFFERENT). HE STATED, ""THAT THE ODDS OF IT LEAKING IS 1%, IT IS A COHESIVE GEL THAT DOES NOT LEAK. IT IS JUST NORMAL AFTER BREAST SURGERY PAIN."" I HAVE HAD SEVERAL BREAST SURGERIES, NEVER FELT THIS TYPE OF PAIN. ON (B)(6) 2013 I WENT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM BECAUSE AFTER NOT WEARING A BRA TO BED I HAD SEVERE BURNING IN MY RIGHT AREOLA/NIPPLE, ARMPIT PAIN, AND MY RIGHT ARM WAS TINGLING/NUMB/PAIN INCLUDING RING FINGER/PINKY FINGER. THEY DID AN ULTRASOUND, PHONED DR (B)(6) (WHO THEN SHOWED UP TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM). ON (B)(6) 2013 DR (B)(6) SENT ME TO A WRIST ORTHO SURGEON FOR CARPAL TUNNEL, WHICH I DID NOT UNDERSTAND BECAUSE MY RIGHT BREAST HURT, ARMPIT, THE ARM, AND MY RING AND PINKY FINGER. I REQUESTED AN MRI, PERFORMED ON (B)(6) 2013. AFTER THE MRI, I WAS ASKED TO HAVE AN ULTRASOUND. THE RADIOLOGIST WOULD ONLY SAY THAT I DID NOT HAVE BREAST CANCER, I STATED ""THAT IS NOT WHY I AM HERE, IS THE SILICONE LEAKING?"" SHE WOULD NOT SAY. I SAW DR (B)(6) A BREAST SURGEON THAT DR (B)(6) SENT ME TO, WHO SCREAMED THAT I SHOULD JUST TAKE IT OUT (I HAD A WITNESS). I WENT TO MY REGULAR OB-GYN (DR (B)(6)) AND GOT A REFERRAL FOR DR (B)(6). DR (B)(6) LIFTED THE RIGHT BREAST IMPLANT SQUEEZED (NOT VERY HARD) APPROX 2 HOURS AFTER ARRIVING HOME, ALL THE PAIN SYMPTOMS STARTED IN SUCCESSION (AS BEFORE) ...BREAST, ARMPIT, NECK, BACK, THEN DOWN THE ARM AND HAND/FINGERS. THEN BOTH MY LEGS WERE HAVING SOME TYPE OF NERVE SPASMS FOR APPROX AN HOUR (THAT WAS ON A FRIDAY). SUNDAY MORNING I AWOKE TO VERY, VERY SWOLLEN LYMPH NODES IN MY NECK/THROAT. I DEBATED ON GOING TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM BECAUSE I THOUGHT MY THROAT WAS CLOSING... FAST FORWARD 6 MONTHS LATER, I HAVE SEEN AN ORTHO SURGEON, MY OB, A NEUROLOGIST, SEVERAL APPOINTMENTS WITH DOCTOR (B)(6), I HAVE BEEN TIRED, LYMPH NODES IN FRONT OF NECK SWELL, BACK OF NECK FEEL LIKE ROCKS, MY RIGHT BREAST BURNS CONSISTENTLY, ARMPIT HURTS CONSISTENTLY. I HAVE LITTLE RED BUMPS ALL OVER MY BODY (ALMOST LIKE MOLES) THEY WERE PROGRESSING AROUND MY BODY, AS WITH THE NUMBNESS/TINGLING. THE RIGHT BREAST IS SMALLER, NIPPLE LOWER, IT DOES NOT FEEL LIKE IT HAS A DENSE CONSISTENCY. THE RADIOLOGIST REPORT WAS WRITTEN INCORRECTLY, IT STATES... ""A PREPECTORAL SILICONE IMPLANT IS NOTED IN PLACE WITH INTACT SALINE ENVELOPE."" THIS HAS BEEN AN ISSUE BECAUSE UPON GETTING A SECOND AND THIRD OPINION, BECAUSE THERE IS NO SALINE. THIS INDICATES AN IMPLANT THAT IS NO LONGER MADE. I HAVE ASKED FOR THE REPORT TO BE AMENDED, AND THE DOCTOR (RADIOLOGIST DECLINED).

I OPTED TO HAVE GEL BREAST IMPLANTS IN 1998. IN 2006 I FELT THAT THOSE IMPLANTS WERE LEAKING AND SO I SCHEDULED AN MRI. THE MRI WAS SENT TO THE SURGEON WHO DID THE IMPLANTS. AT THE APPOINTMENT, I ASKED HER IF SHE HAD READ THE MRI AND SHE SAID ""THAT MRI'S WERE NOT RELIABLE"" AND THAT THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW WAS TO HAVE SURGERY. I RECEIVED A QUOTE FOR OVER (B)(6) DOLLARS AND DID NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO PURSUE THE SURGERY. I TOOK HER WORD THAT THE MRI WAS NOT RELIABLE. SOON AFTER THAT I STARTED HAVING MANY ILLNESS SYMPTOMS INCLUDING MS, LUPUS, GUILLAIN-BARRE, AUTO IMMUNE DISORDER, ETC. I SAW 7 SPECIALISTS INCLUDING A NEUROLOGIST AT (B)(6), ENDOCRINOLOGISTS, AN ORAL SURGEON, AND INTERNISTS. NONE OF THEM SEEMED TO KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG. I ALSO SAW A DOCTOR IN (B)(6) WHO RAN HAIR ANALYSIS AND BLOOD WORK THAT SHOWED MANY OF MY FUNCTIONS - I.E.: LIVER, WHITE BLOOD COUNT, THYROID, ADRENALS, ETC., WERE NOT NORMAL. OVER THE LAST 6-7 YEARS MY SYMPTOMS HAVE CONTINUED TO WORSEN, MORE TESTS, AND NO ANSWERS. IN (B)(6) 2014, I DECIDED TO SEE A SECOND DOCTOR HERE IN (B)(6), A PLASTIC SURGEON, AND TOLD HIM THAT I FELT MY IMPLANTS MAY BE LEAKING. HE BLEW ME OFF AND DID NOT AGREE THAT LEAKING IMPLANTS CAUSE HEALTH ISSUES. AT THIS POINT, I DECIDED TO MOVE OUT OF TRADITIONAL MEDICINE DUE TO NO ANSWERS OR HELP FOR MY CONDITIONS. DUE TO ALL MY SYMPTOMS, SOME WHICH INCLUDE: PARTIAL PARALYSIS, HEADACHES, CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDER, GRAVES DISEASE, SHAKINESS, TREMORS, ETC., I STARTED SEEING DR (B)(6) WHO PRACTICES (B)(6) MEDICINE AND ACUPUNCTURE HERE IN (B)(6). AFTER A FEW TREATMENTS, I WAS GETTING ONLY PARTIAL RESULTS. I MENTIONED TO HIM THAT I THOUGHT MY SILICONE IMPLANTS MAY MBE LEAKING. HE IMMEDIATELY FELT THAT WAS WHAT WAS CAUSING ALL MY SYMPTOMS. HE SAID HE HAS HAD MANY PATIENTS OVER THE YEARS WHO HAD IMPLANTS LEAKING AND SOME WERE SO SICK THEY COULD NOT EVEN HAVE THE SURGERY FOR REMOVAL. I WAS REFERRED TO DR (B)(6). I GOOGLED HER ONLINE AND FOUND THAT SHE WAS SPECIALIZED IN IMPLANT EXPLANTATION AND WAS DOUBLE BOARD CERTIFIED. SHE HAS DONE OVER 3,000 EXPLANT PROCEDURES. I MET WITH DR (B)(6) IN (B)(6) AND SHE SPENT LOTS OF TIME EXPLAINING HOW LEAKING IMPLANTS COULD CAUSE ALL THESE HEALTH ISSUES. AFTER EXAMINATION, SHE DEFINITELY FELT MY IMPLANTS WERE LEAKING AND/OR RUPTURED. DR (B)(6) RECOMMENDED THAT THIS WAS MEDICALLY NECESSARY FOR ME TO CONTINUE TO STAY ALIVE. I CONTACTED MCGHAN REGARDING MY IMPLANTS. THEY TOLD ME THEY SHOW THAT IN 2006 MY IMPLANTS WERE STILL UNDER WARRANTY AND ASKED FOR A COPY OF THE MRI. I CONTACTED MY SURGEON IN (B)(6) WHO DID THE ORIGINAL SURGERY AND ASKED THEM IF THEY HAD MY MRI FROM 2006. IMAGINE MY SURPRISE WHEN IT SAID THAT THE RIGHT IMPLANT WAS RUPTURED WAY BACK THEN! SHE HAD NEVER SHARED THIS REPORT WITH ME. THE SURGERY WAS COMPLETED ON (B)(6) 2014. THE RIGHT IMPLANT WAS TOTALLY DETERIORATED FROM A RUPTURE AND THERE WAS SO MUCH SILICONE THAT THE OPERATING ROOM NURSE SAID THIS WAS ONE OF THE WORST SHE HAD EVER SEEN. THE LEFT IMPLANT WAS INTACT BUT LEAKING. THE COST OF THE REMOVAL INCLUDING ANESTHESIA AND SURGERY CENTER WAS (B)(6) DOLLARS. AT THIS POINT MCGHAN HAS SAID THEY WILL ONLY COVER UP TO (B)(6) DOLLARS PER IMPLANT IF RUPTURED. I HAD TO BORROW THIS MONEY AS ALL THESE FEES HAD TO BE PAID UP FRONT BUT I KNEW MY LIFE DEPENDED ON IT. THE MONEY FOR THIS LOAN HAS TO BE REPAID BY (B)(6) 2014. I DO NOT KNOW WHERE I AM GOING TO GET THIS MONEY. I FEEL THAT MCGHAN SHOULD PAY FOR THIS REMOVAL. THEIR PRODUCT WAS OBVIOUSLY DEFECTIVE WHILE UNDER WARRANTY AND NO ONE INFORMED ME ABOUT THE MRI REPORT.

THESE WERE DUPONT SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS THAT WERE INSERTED IN (B)(6) 1976. I KNOW THEY HAVE BEEN RUPTURED FOR A LONG TIME. ONE BREAST FEELS LIKE A MASS OF JELLY. THE OTHER BREAST IS HARD AND HAS THE CAPSULAR CONTRACTION. THE GEL IS OOZING OUT AND CALCIFYING ON THE OUTSIDE. I WILL BE (B)(6) OF THIS YEAR (2014). THE IMPLANTS HAVE BEEN IN FOR ALMOST 40 YEARS. I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MEDICARE COVERS THE EXPLANT AND REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT MATERIAL BUT DOES NOT COVER THE EXCHANGE OF IMPLANTS. I WAS QUOTED BY A DOCTOR (B)(6) FOR REMOVAL OF BOTH IMPLANTS AND EXCHANGE WITH NEW ONES. WHEN THEY WERE ADVISED THAT MEDICARE PAID ONLY FOR THE REMOVAL THEY THEN QUOTED ME A PRICE OF (B)(6) TO INSERT THE IMPLANT AT THE SAME TIME. I WOULD HAVE TO PAY THE (B)(6). I FAIL TO SEE THE LOGIC OF THE PRICING. HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT MY MAJOR CONCERN. DUE TO THE AGE AND MY BELIEF THAT THE RUPTURE OCCURRED YEARS AGO, I WONDER HOW MUCH OF THIS GEL HAS TRAVELED THROUGH MY BODY. THE PLASTIC SURGEON TOLD ME THAT THE SILICONE MATERIAL IN THIS PARTICULAR IMPLANT WAS VERY THIN AND JUST RAN OUT LIKE WATER. I HAVE BEEN READING ABOUT ACL AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT SILICONE LEAKAGE CAN CAUSE THIS DISEASE. IF IT DOES, I WOULD BE THE LIKELY CANDIDATE TO SEE IF THE GEL HAS TRAVELED TO THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM. THIS IS MY BIGGEST CONCERN. I WAS JUST A LITTLE PUZZLED THAT THE PRICING FOR INSERTION OF NEW BREAST PROSTHESES WAS ONLY (B)(6) LESS THAN THE PROCEDURE FOR CLEANING OUT THE RUPTURED IMPLANT AND PUTTING A NEW ONE IN ITS PLACE.

MY CURRENT DOCTOR, DR (B)(6), THAT HE WAS CONCERNED THERE WOULD BE SOME DISFIGUREMENT FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANTS BECAUSE OF TISSUE REMOVAL AND PERHAPS THE NECESSITY TO REMOVE MORE AND ALSO THE FACT THAT THE TISSUE COVERING THE IMPLANT HAS BEEN EXPANDED FOR SUCH A PERIOD OF TIME.

MY DOCTOR/SURGEON DID EXCELLENT JOB. SO (B)(6) 2014, I HAD 1ST SET REMOVED AND WAS EXCITED TO HAVE MY 2ND SET IMPLANTED, EXPECTING TO NEVER HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS PAIN AGAIN. SURE ENOUGH I HAD DISCOVERED THE LEAK AND MADE AN APPT WITH MY DOCTOR LAST WEEK AND HE DIAGNOSED IT AS A RUPTURED/DEFECTIVE IMPLANT. I AM GIVEN THE OPTION OF HAVING BOTH REMOVED, AND STITCHED BACK UP AND RECOVER, OR REPLACE ONE OR BOTH IMPLANTS (UNDER WARRANTY). I CHOSE AND IT'S ALMOST IF YOU WANT TO LOOK NORMAL YOU MUST REPLACE THEM AS YOUR SKIN HAS GOTTEN SO STRETCHED OUT. SO I HAVE A SURGERY DATE OF (B)(6) 2014. I HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THIS PAIN FROM HAVING NOT ONE, BUT BOTH IMPLANTS REPLACED SO I DO NOT LOOK DISFIGURED. IF I CHOSE TO HAVE THEM REMOVED, I WOULD STILL NEED SOME TYPE OF COSMETIC WORK ON BOTH BREASTS AS THEY WOULD SAG AND LOOK TERRIBLE. EITHER WAY, BECAUSE OF A DEFECTIVE IMPLANT I HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS ALL OVER AGAIN WHEN I THOUGHT I WAS DONE. NOT THE SURGEON'S FAULT.

5004369|23148611|D|1||I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY CORRESPONDENCE FROM MENTOR ABOUT PROBLEMS OR FAULTY IMPLANTS OR ANY IMPLANT STUDY; NEITHER HAVE ANY OF MY FRIENDS WHO HAD IMPLANTS DUE TO CANCER. IN 1990 I HAD A LEFT BREAST RECONSTRUCTED AFTER A MASTECTOMY IN 1989. I HAD ONLY ONE TROUBLE-FREE YEAR WITH THE MENTOR BECKER PROSTHESIS. I COMPLAINED OFTEN TO MY PS DOCTOR THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS CAUSING SEVERE ITCHING, CHANGING SHAPE AND MAKING LUMPY SPOTS ON MY TORSO. IN 2002, I HAD XRAYS SHOWING ALL THE SALINE HAD LEAKED OUT AND THE SILICONE WAS LEAKING INTO THE BROKEN SALINE BAG. THE PS AGREED TO TAKE IT OUT, BUT WANTED TO REPLACE IT WITH A DIFFERENT KIND, A MENTOR SALINE PRODUCT. I WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A QUICK SURGERY AND GO HOME THAT DAY; INSTEAD, THE SURGERY TOOK FOUR HOURS, I SPENT SEVERAL PAINFUL DAYS IN THE HOSPITAL AND A WEEK AT HOME OFF WORK. I WAS TOLD THAT THE SILICONE IMPLANT HAD BROKEN IN MY CHEST WALL AND IT HAD TO BE CLEANED AND WASHED OUT. IN 2008, MY HEALTH STARTED A FAST DETERIORATION. DURING THE NEXT FEW YEARS MY GP DOCTOR BEGAN TO RUN VARIOUS TESTS ON ME AND SAW A PATTERN. I WAS HAVING IMMUNE SYSTEM PROBLEMS, AND MANY TESTS THAT HAD BEEN OK BEGAN TO BE OFF NORMAL. HE KNEW THAT I HAD THAT NEW BREAST IMPLANT AFTER THE FIRST ONE RUPTURED. WHEN THE ANA LUPUS TEST WAS POSITIVE AND SEVERAL RELATED TESTS WERE BAD, HE TOLD ME HE THOUGHT I SHOULD SEE A RHEUMATOLOGIST. BOTH DOCTORS TOLD ME TO HAVE THE IMPLANT REMOVED. I WENT TO SEE MY PLASTIC SURGEON ONLY TO FIND OUT HE WAS MOVING TO ANOTHER STATE AND SEMI-RETIRING. HE ALSO SAID AFTER MY SURGERY HE NO LONGER WORKED WITH SILICONE IMPLANTS. HE INTRODUCED ME TO A NEW PLASTIC SURGEON WHO TAUGHT AT THE MEDICAL SCHOOL. I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH HER TO SEE IF SHE WOULD REMOVE MY IMPLANT AND TOLD HER ABOUT MY MEDICAL PROBLEMS. SHE SAID THERE WAS NO HARD EVIDENCE THAT BREAST IMPLANTS CAUSED THEM AND CONVINCED ME I SHOULD THINK ABOUT HOW MY BODY WOULD LOOK WITHOUT THE IMPLANT. I WENT HOME AND TRIED TO DEAL WITH MY HEALTH PROBLEMS, AND SAW MY RHEUMATOLOGIST. MY TESTS WERE GETTING WORSE, I BARELY WALKED WITH A CANE, MY EYES AND GUMS WERE INFECTED, MY JOINTS WERE INFLAMED, MY HAIR WAS FALLING OUT AND MY SKIN WAS PUFFY. HE TOLD ME I NEEDED TO GET THE IMPLANT TAKEN OUT SOON BECAUSE EVEN A LITTLE BIT OF SILICONE LIKE THE COVER OF THE IMPLANT WOULD WORSEN THE AUTOIMMUNE RESPONSE OF MY BODY. I WENT BACK TO THE NEW PLASTIC SURGEON, BUT THIS TIME I SHOWED HER I SHOWED HER MY OFFICIAL HOSPITAL SURGERY REPORTS. AFTER SHE SAW THEM, SHE LOOKED UP SOME MORE ABOUT IT AND FOUND THAT MY FIRST IMPLANT WAS SO BADLY RUPTURED THAT THE SURGEONS COULDN'T GET ALL OF IT AND EVEN THE BACK PORTION OF THE FIRST IMPLANT WAS STILL STUCK TO MY CHEST WALL OVER MY HEART. SHE EXPLAINED HOW DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE TO GET THAT OUT, BUT SHE COMPLETELY CHANGED HER MIND ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE RUPTURE AND SILICONE ON MY HEALTH. SHE PRESCRIBED A BREAST SURGEON AND AN MRI, WHICH SHOWED SILICONE MIGRATED ALL OVER MY MID, LEFT, AND SIDE TORSO AND THE WHOLE BACK OF THE IMPLANT WAS STUCK TO MY RIBS, AND THE SALINE CAPSULE HAD RUPTURED. MY IMMUNE SYSTEM HAD BUILT A SCAR TISSUE WALL AROUND IT TRYING TO GET RID OF IT ALL. LONG STORY SHORT: I HAD A SIX HOUR SURGERY (B)(6) 2012 WITH TWO SURGEONS AND TWO RESIDENT PS'S, FOR AN EXPLANTATION AND MASTECTOMY OF MY RIGHT BREAST. THEY CLEANED OFF ALL THE SILICONE THEY COULD FIND INCLUDING THE BACK PIECE OF THE IMPLANT OVER MY HEART. MY PS WAS SMILING WHEN SHE CAME IN TO TELL ME THE GOOD NEWS. I DON'T THINK SHE WILL EVER TELL ANOTHER WOMAN THAT THERE IS NO CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SILICONE IMPLANT AND HEALTH CONCERNS. MY HEALTH STARTED IMPROVING IMMEDIATELY BUT NOT THE OSTEOPOROSIS IN MY HIPS NOR MY JOINTS. I'VE HAD BOTH HIPS REPLACED AND STILL HAD ANA POSITIVE TESTS. I'M TOLD I HAD THE SILICONE IN MY SYSTEM TOO LONG. I LOST MORE THAN TEN YEARS OF A ONCE HEALTHY LIFE TO SILICONE POISONING. PS: I WAS NEVER COMPENSATED IN ANY WAY FOR THE BROKEN IMPLANTS AND WAS NOT AWARE OF ANY CLASS ACTION SUITS.|BECKER PROSTHESIS AND SALINE IMPLANT||08/10/2015||||*|R||I|FWM|0.0||BECKER PROSTHESIS AND SALINE IMPLANT|||||||MENTOR|||||||True

5222818|31178939|N|1||(B)(4). DEVICE LABELING: BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. IN THE PASS STUDY, AT LEAST 1 REOPERATION WAS PERFORMED ON 315 PATIENTS (36.5%) THROUGH 10 YEARS. A TOTAL OF 424 REOPERATIONS WERE PERFORMED. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR REOPERATION THROUGH 10 YEARS ON AUGMENTATION PATIENTS WAS IMPLANT DEFLATION AT 21.7%. THE PERCENTAGE OF REOPERATIONS DUE TO LUMP/MASS/CYST INCREASED FROM 8.5% OF 293 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 5 YEARS TO 13.9% OF 424 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 10 YEARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF LUMPS, MASSES, AND CYSTS CAN BE EXPECTED TO NATURALLY INCREASE AS PATIENTS AGE AND COULD BE AN EXPLANATION FOR THE INCREASE. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, ASYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. OF THE 237 PATIENTS IN THE R95 STUDY, AT LEAST 1 REOPERATION WAS PERFORMED ON 99 PATIENTS (42%) FOR A TOTAL OF 125 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 5 YEARS. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR REOPERATION THROUGH 5 YEARS WAS CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE AT 25.6%. OF THE 237 RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS IN R95, THERE WERE 62 PATIENTS (26.2%) WHO HAD 70 IMPLANTS REMOVED THROUGH 5 YEARS. OF THE 70 RECONSTRUCTION IMPLANTS REMOVED THROUGH 5 YEARS, 70% WERE REPLACED. THE MOST COMMON REASON FOR IMPLANT REMOVAL WAS CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE (31.4%). THROUGH 10 YEARS, THERE WERE 104 IMPLANTS REMOVED FROM 85 PATIENTS. THE MOST COMMON REASON FOR IMPLANT REMOVAL WAS IMPLANT LEAKAGE/DEFLATION (32.7%).|STYLE 363 SALINE FILLED BREAST IMPLANT|363LF-410|11/13/2015||||N|R||0HP|FWM|1.0|10/09/2005|PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||569053|900 PARKWAY GLOBAL PARK|ZONA FRANCA||CS|ALLERGAN (COSTA RICA)|||||||True

MY QUESTION IS AS FOLLOW: IS IT SAFE TO KEEP THE SILICONE LEAKED AND CAPTURED BY 4 OTHER LYMPH NODES ? WHAT DOES THE LATEST STUDY SAYS ABOUT LEAVING THE SILICONE IN LYMPH NODES? DOES IT MAKE ME SICK? CANCER IN THE FUTURE? IS THERE ANY OTHER SOLUTION TO REMOVE THE SILICONE WITHOUT REMOVING THE LYMPH NODES?

THE REPORTED DEVICE WAS INTACT AT THE TIME OF PRODUCTION AND MET THE REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS. THE EVENTS OF LYMPHOMA-ALCL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, INFLAMMATION AND PAIN ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THESE EVENTS.

THE DARN IMPLANTS HAVE BEEN LEAKING AS PER THE BIOPSY THAT I JUST WAS NOTIFIED ABOUT I HAVE SILICONE IN MY TISSUE EVEN THOUGH MY IMPLANTS DID NOT HAVE A NORMAL BREAK IN THEM. SO MAYBE THE FDA SHOULD HAVE MADE ME AWARE OF HOW UNSAFE SILICONE IMPLANTS BY THIS COMPANY INNAMED OR MCGHAN STYLE 153 DOUBLE LUMEN. THE MRI I DID HAVE COULD NOT TELL FOR SURE ANYTHING I THOUGHT IT COULD HAVE A RUPTURE IN ONE BREAST. THIS ONE HAD BEEN REPLACED PREVIOUSLY BY MY FORMER SURGEON AND THE BREAST HAD CAPSULAR CONTRACTION, WAS HARD A ROCK. THIS ONE WAS REPLACED BY FORMER SURGEON AFTER THE ORIGINAL SURGERY IN 2002 - 2003. SO I WAS SHOCKED TO LEARN THESE IMPLANTS WERE NOT WHAT I HAD THOUGHT I WAS GETTING, AND WHEN I CALLED TO FIND OUT ANY INFO I WAS GIVEN, THE RUN AROUND SAYING I WAS NOT ON THE LIST BY MFR OF BOTH OF THE CURRENT COMPANIES OF THIS TYPE OF IMPLANT WHICH IS EVEN MORE UNSAFE FOR THE PUBLIC, AND GOD KNOWS I HAVE SUFFERED MYSELF NOW FOR YEARS WITH UNEXPLAINED PAIN IN MY ARMS, TIREDNESS AND THE STRESS OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HECK WAS WRONG WITH ME. SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE. THIS IS JUST NOT FAIR. WE ARE AT OUR LOWEST WHEN WE LEARN OF THE CANCER AND ARE TRYING TO PREVENT ANYTHING MORE SERIOUS FROM HAPPENING. SINCE I HAD 4 CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 18 AT THE TIME OF MY SURGERY YEARS AGO TO LEARN. YEARS LATER THE PERSON I TRUSTED LIED AND MY GOVERNMENT IS NOT WATCHING OUT FOR OUR SAFETY THIS MAKES ME VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE USA WHEN EUROPE HAS BETTER SAFETY MEASURES IN PLACE FOR THE CITIZENS OF THEIR COUNTRY.

PRIOR TO HAVING THESE IMPLANTS PUT IN, I WAS A VERY HEALTHY INDIVIDUAL. I AM JUST VERY SHOCKED AFTER DOING ALL MY RESEARCH ON THE NET AND HEARING THAT ALL THESE OTHER WOMEN ARE HAVING THE SAME ISSUES THAT I AM AND YOU ARE STILL APPROVING THEM. LET ME JUST START OUT BY WHAT THESE APPROVED IMPLANTS HAVE STOLEN FROM ME. I HAVE ENDOMETRIOSIS STAGE 4, INFERTILITY NO BABIES, BLADDER PROBLEMS, MUSCLE SPASMS ALL OVER MY BODY, FIBROMYALGIA AND MYOFASCIAL SYNDROME, LEAKY GUT AND CANDIDA OVERGROWTH. I AM HAVING THESE TOXIC BALLS REMOVED NEXT MONTH AND OF COURSE INSURANCE WILL NOT PAY FOR THIS PROCEDURE, SINCE YOU SAY THAT THEY POSE NO HEALTH ISSUES AND ARE PERFECTLY SAFE. EVERY DOCTOR I HAVE SEEN THINKS AND BELIEVES IN WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT THESE IMPLANTS. I DO HOPE YOU WILL TAKE THIS EMAIL VERY SERIOUSLY BECAUSE A LOT OF WOMEN ARE SUFFERING FROM THESE SO CALLED SAFE IMPLANTS WHICH IS A COMPLETE LIE THAT THEY ARE SAFE. IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE CHEMICALS THESE IMPLANTS HAVE IN THEM AND THEN THINK THAT THESE CHEMICALS WILL NOT SPREAD THROUGHOUT OUR BODIES THEN YOU ARE BLIND. I AM GOING TO BE ONE OF THOSE LOUD PEOPLE WHO SOUND THE ALARM FOR WOMEN OUT THERE BECAUSE THIS HAS GONE ON TOO LONG. HOW DARE YOU AND ALL THESE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS THINK YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH POISONING WOMEN AND LIE TO US JUST SO THAT THESE DOCTORS CAN BE MILLIONAIRES FROM GETTING PEOPLE SICK. THESE IMPLANTS SHOULD NOT BE KEPT ON THE MARKET AS SAFE. IF THEY ARE, THESE WOMEN SHOULD KNOW THE DANGERS THAT CAN COME FROM PUTTING THEM IN THEIR BODIES. I HAD TO CLOSE MY BUSINESS AND CUT BACK ON WORK HOURS DUE TO MY SICKNESS. THIS HAS AFFECTED MY FINANCIAL SITUATION. I HAVE BILLS THAT NEED TO BE PAID AND I CAN'T WORK FULL TIME BECAUSE OF MY SICKNESS. PLEASE LISTEN TO THE WOMEN THEY ARE TRYING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.
