POST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: BILATERAL CAPSULE FORMATION WITH CHRONIC ABSCESS AND PURULENCY, RIGHT BREAST; LEAKING IMPLANT, RIGHT BREAST. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: BILATERAL OPEN CAPSULECTOMIES; IMPLANT MATERIAL REMOVAL. PROCEDURE: THE PT WAS PREPARED AND DRAPED UNDER GENERAL ENDOTRACHEAL ANESTHESIA. ALL THE RISKS, ALTERNATIVES AND IMPONDERABLES WERE AGAIN DISCUSSED WITH THE PT PRIOR TO PROCEEDING. OUTSIDE OPERATIVE NOTES IMPLIED THIS HAD 180CC SILICONE IMPLANTS WITH A 20CC SALINE SHELL ON EACH SIDE. HER LEFT BREAST WAS LARGER THAN THE RIGHT WITH SYMPTOMATIC BILATERAL CAPSULES, RIGHT GREATER THAN LEFT. SHE ALSO HAD CHRONIC RECURRENT INFECTIONS ON THE RIGHT BREAST; MOST RECENTLY TREATED APPROX ONE MONTH AGO ON THE RIGHT SIDE. BOTH BREASTS WERE EXPLORED THROUGH BILATERAL INFRAMAMMARY INCISIONS. RIGHT SIDE WAS DONE FIRST AND ON ENTERING THE BREAST THERE WAS FRANK PURULENCY; APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF CUP FULL. THIS WAS SENT OFF FOR A STAT GRAM STAIN WHICH LATER CAME BACK SHOWING WHITE BLOOD CELLS, NO ORGANISMS, COMPATIBLE WITH A STERILE ABSCESS. IN ADDITION TO THIS, THERE WAS A VERY SIGNIFICANT CAPSULE WITH CALCIFICATION, AND THERE APPEARED TO BE A HEMATOMA FORMATION WITHIN THE CAPSULE. CAPSULE WAS VERY TEDIOUSLY REMOVED AFTER THE SILICONE IMPLANT WAS REMOVED. THE SILICONE IMPLANT WEIGHTED APPROX 188 GRAMS AND HAD A LEAK IN THE IMPLANT WITH SILICONE BLEED AROUND THE IMPLANT. BOTH OF THESE IMPLANTS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE 180CC WITH 20CC SALINE ENVELOPE. NEITHER HAD THE SALINE ENVELOPE INTACT AND WHEN THE LEFT SIDE WAS REMOVED IT TURNED OUT TO BE A 130CC IMPLANT, NO 180CC AS THE OPERATIVE DATA SHOWED THAT STAFF HAD. THE LEFT SIDE WAS DONE IN A SIMILAR FASHION, AGAIN WITH INTENSE CAPSULE FORMATION BUT THE IMPLANT WAS INTACT. BECAUSE OF THE OBVIOUS PURULENCY ENCOUNTERED AS WELL AS THE GROSS DISCREPANCY OF THE IMPLANTS, IT WAS FELT IT VERY IMPRUDENT TO REPLACE THE IMPLANTS AFTER THE BILATERAL IMPLANT REMOVAL, IMPLANT MATERIAL AND BILATERAL FORMAL OPEN CAPSULECTOMIES. STAFF WILL NEED TO DO THAT AT A SECONDARY STAGE. THE POCKETS WERE IRRIGATED WITH COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF A SOLUTION ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AND METICULOUS HEMOSTASIS WAS ACHIEVED WITH CAUTERY AND THE POCKETS WERE CLOSED OVER 19MM BLAKE DRAIN ON EACH SIDE WITH INTERRUPTED BURIED 3-0 VICRYL FOLLOWED BY INTERRUPTED BURIED 4-0 AND 5-0 VICRYL AND A LIGHT COMPRESSIVE WRAP. BLOOD LOSS WAS NEGLIGIBLE. NO BLOOD PRODUCTS WERE GIVEN. THE PT WAS AWAKE AND LEFT THE OPERATING ROOM PER ANESTHESIA. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT RIGHT BREAST IMPLANT WEIGHT WAS 188 GRAMS, LEFT BREAST 136 GRAMS. TOTAL WEIGHT OF RIGHT BREAST IMPLANT WITH CAPSULE 246 GRAMS AND LEFT BREAST IMPLANT WITH CAPSULE 155 GRAMS.

2119775|2053625|D|1||(B)(6) IS A (B)(6) WHITE FEMALE WHO PRESENTED TO MY OFFICE (B)(6) 2010 WITH AN INFECTED RIGHT BREAST. SHE HAD PREVIOUS SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS 17 YEARS PRIOR TO A LITTLE OVER A YEAR OF SYMPTOMS INCLUDING PAIN, ENLARGEMENT AND MORE RECENTLY REDNESS. THERE WAS A FAILED COURSE OF ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY. AT THE TIME OF HER PRESENTATION SHE ALSO HAD EPIDERMOLYSIS OF HER HANDS, FEET, AND PERIAREOLAR REGION. EXAM WAS CONSISTENT WITH AN INFECTED BREAST IMPLANT, THEREFORE, THE IMPLANT WAS REMOVED IN THE OFFICE UNDER LOCAL ANESTHESIA. HER EPIDERMOLYSIS EVENTUALLY CLEARED AND THE INFECTION IMPROVED. HOWEVER, SHE DEVELOPED AN INFLAMMATORY ABSCESS IN THE INFRAMAMMARY PORTION OF THE RIGHT BREAST THAT REQUIRED OPERATIVE EXCISION AND DEBRIDEMENT UNDER ANESTHESIA. THE TISSUE THAT WAS REMOVED AND SENT TO THE LABORATORY CAME BACK ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA. THIS BREAST EVENTUALLY WENT ON TO HEAL. SHE WAS SEEN IN CONSULTATION AT (B)(6) AND RECEIVED CHEMOTHERAPY. BECAUSE OF THE POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION OF THE CANCER WITH THE IMPLANT, ALONG WITH HER ASYMMETRY ISSUES, SHE REQUESTED REMOVAL OF THE LEFT IMPLANT, WHICH WAS DONE UNEVENTFULLY. OF NOTE IS THAT THE IMPLANT ON THE LEFT SIDE WAS RUPTURED, BUT IDENTIFICATION WAS ABLE TO BE MADE INDICATING A MCGHAN 360CC SILICONE GEL TEXTURED IMPLANT. THE PRODUCT WAS RETAINED AND IS AVAILABLE FOR EXAMINATION. THE PT CONTINUES TO BE UNDER MY CARE AT THIS TIME.|MCGHAN TEXTURED SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLANT, 360CC|UNK|06/03/2011||||Y|||000|FTR|1.0||BREAST IMPLANT||UNK|||||MCGHAN CORPORATION|||||UNK||True
3474013|15266478|D|1||IN 2010 I EXPERIENCED A HEMATOMA IN THE LOWER INSIDE OF MY LEFT BREAST ACCOMPANIED BY GREAT PAIN. GRADUALLY THE BREAST DEVELOPED A PAINFUL CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE AND A MASS IN MY LEFT ARMPIT LYMPH NODES WHICH WAS TREATED BY THE (B)(6) WITH AN ASTHMA MEDICATION THAT DID NOT WORK. I THEN RECEIVED A LETTER ABOUT ALCL WHICH ALARMED ME EVEN FURTHER AND SAW SEVERAL DOCTORS OF WHICH NONE KNEW HOW TO TEST FOR ALCL. I BEGAN EXPERIENCING A SENSATION IN MY CHEST THAT FELT LIKE AN ABSCESS THAT WAS SPREADING THROUGH MY RIBCAGE INTO MY LUNG WHICH MAKES IT INCREDIBLY HARD TO SLEEP AT NIGHT. I AM IN CONSTANT PAIN. RECENTLY, MY OFFICE AT (B)(4)WAS CLOSED, SO I WAS FORCED TO GO INTO A FIELD TECHNICIAN OR LINEMAN POSITION. AS I HAVE PROGRESSED IN MY TRAINING FOR THE LAST 6 MONTHS, I HAVE EXPERIENCED AN UNBELIEVABLE AMOUNT OF PAIN, LACK OF SLEEP AND UBER FATIGUE. I WENT TO THE (B)(6) DID NOT AUTOMATICALLY PROVIDE INSURANCE THIS LAST YEAR AND ASKED FOR AN MRI. I FINALLY GOT THE MRI AND THE RADIOLOGIST STATED THE IMPLANT WAS POSSIBLY RUPTURED AND THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF 2 LEAKS (EXACT WORDING SUBJECT TO INTERPRETATION). SINCE I RECEIVED THAT INFORMATION 2 WEEKS AGO, I HAVE RESEARCHED THE INTERNET AND FOUND THAT (B)(4) IS PROVIDING EXPLANT MONEY UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS. UNFORTUNATELY, THE CONDITIONS OR STIPULATIONS ARE EXTREMELY SUBJECTIVE, FOR EXAMPLE, THE EXPLANT MONEY IS ONLY ALLOTTED IF THE IMPLANT WAS NOT SUBJECT TO OR EXPOSED TO SOME SORT OF STRESS OR ACCIDENT. ALSO, THE LIFETIME WARRANTY IN SOME CASES WILL NOT BE APPLICABLE. THIS BRINGS UP THE QUESTION OF WHEN THAT DETERMINATION WILL BE MADE. IN MY OWN CASE, IF THE IMPLANTS ARE NOT UNDER WARRANTY, I WOULD CHOOSE NOT TO HAVE THEM REPLACED. SO WHAT ARE THE DYNAMICS OF AN EXPLANT SURGERY? WILL (B)(4) PROVIDE BREAST IMPLANTS IN THE CASE THAT MY EXPLANT FITS INTO THEIR PERFECT LITTLE BOX THEY HAVE CREATED AND WILL MY SURGEON BE COMPELLED TO GO THROUGH THIS CHECKLIST IN THE MIDDLE OF SURGERY TO DET...|SILIMED BREAST IMPLANT|UNK|11/13/2013|||||||0|FTR|1.0|11/25/2014|BREAST IMPLANT||UNK|||||SIENTRA|||||SILIMED|UNK|True
