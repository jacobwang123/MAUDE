POST-OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: BILATERAL CAPSULE FORMATION WITH CHRONIC ABSCESS AND PURULENCY, RIGHT BREAST; LEAKING IMPLANT, RIGHT BREAST. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: BILATERAL OPEN CAPSULECTOMIES; IMPLANT MATERIAL REMOVAL. PROCEDURE: THE PT WAS PREPARED AND DRAPED UNDER GENERAL ENDOTRACHEAL ANESTHESIA. ALL THE RISKS, ALTERNATIVES AND IMPONDERABLES WERE AGAIN DISCUSSED WITH THE PT PRIOR TO PROCEEDING. OUTSIDE OPERATIVE NOTES IMPLIED THIS HAD 180CC SILICONE IMPLANTS WITH A 20CC SALINE SHELL ON EACH SIDE. HER LEFT BREAST WAS LARGER THAN THE RIGHT WITH SYMPTOMATIC BILATERAL CAPSULES, RIGHT GREATER THAN LEFT. SHE ALSO HAD CHRONIC RECURRENT INFECTIONS ON THE RIGHT BREAST; MOST RECENTLY TREATED APPROX ONE MONTH AGO ON THE RIGHT SIDE. BOTH BREASTS WERE EXPLORED THROUGH BILATERAL INFRAMAMMARY INCISIONS. RIGHT SIDE WAS DONE FIRST AND ON ENTERING THE BREAST THERE WAS FRANK PURULENCY; APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF CUP FULL. THIS WAS SENT OFF FOR A STAT GRAM STAIN WHICH LATER CAME BACK SHOWING WHITE BLOOD CELLS, NO ORGANISMS, COMPATIBLE WITH A STERILE ABSCESS. IN ADDITION TO THIS, THERE WAS A VERY SIGNIFICANT CAPSULE WITH CALCIFICATION, AND THERE APPEARED TO BE A HEMATOMA FORMATION WITHIN THE CAPSULE. CAPSULE WAS VERY TEDIOUSLY REMOVED AFTER THE SILICONE IMPLANT WAS REMOVED. THE SILICONE IMPLANT WEIGHTED APPROX 188 GRAMS AND HAD A LEAK IN THE IMPLANT WITH SILICONE BLEED AROUND THE IMPLANT. BOTH OF THESE IMPLANTS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE 180CC WITH 20CC SALINE ENVELOPE. NEITHER HAD THE SALINE ENVELOPE INTACT AND WHEN THE LEFT SIDE WAS REMOVED IT TURNED OUT TO BE A 130CC IMPLANT, NO 180CC AS THE OPERATIVE DATA SHOWED THAT STAFF HAD. THE LEFT SIDE WAS DONE IN A SIMILAR FASHION, AGAIN WITH INTENSE CAPSULE FORMATION BUT THE IMPLANT WAS INTACT. BECAUSE OF THE OBVIOUS PURULENCY ENCOUNTERED AS WELL AS THE GROSS DISCREPANCY OF THE IMPLANTS, IT WAS FELT IT VERY IMPRUDENT TO REPLACE THE IMPLANTS AFTER THE BILATERAL IMPLANT REMOVAL, IMPLANT MATERIAL AND BILATERAL FORMAL OPEN CAPSULECTOMIES. STAFF WILL NEED TO DO THAT AT A SECONDARY STAGE. THE POCKETS WERE IRRIGATED WITH COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF A SOLUTION ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AND METICULOUS HEMOSTASIS WAS ACHIEVED WITH CAUTERY AND THE POCKETS WERE CLOSED OVER 19MM BLAKE DRAIN ON EACH SIDE WITH INTERRUPTED BURIED 3-0 VICRYL FOLLOWED BY INTERRUPTED BURIED 4-0 AND 5-0 VICRYL AND A LIGHT COMPRESSIVE WRAP. BLOOD LOSS WAS NEGLIGIBLE. NO BLOOD PRODUCTS WERE GIVEN. THE PT WAS AWAKE AND LEFT THE OPERATING ROOM PER ANESTHESIA. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT RIGHT BREAST IMPLANT WEIGHT WAS 188 GRAMS, LEFT BREAST 136 GRAMS. TOTAL WEIGHT OF RIGHT BREAST IMPLANT WITH CAPSULE 246 GRAMS AND LEFT BREAST IMPLANT WITH CAPSULE 155 GRAMS.
