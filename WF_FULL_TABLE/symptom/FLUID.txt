REPORTED EVENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN THE LABELING: PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENT. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION.

SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. YOU SHOULD PERFORM SELF-EXAMINATION OF YOUR BREASTS EVERY MONTH FOR CANCER SCREENING. HOWEVER, THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU DISTINGUISH THE IMPLANT FROM YOUR BREAST TISSUE. THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGES IN IMPLANT SHAPE, MAY BE SIGNS OF A RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. THESE SIGNS SHOULD BE REPORTED TO YOUR SURGEON AND POSSIBLY EVALUATED WITH AN MRI. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY.

6498449|72963713|N|1||THIS REPORT IS SUBMITTED IN RESPONSE TO FDA NOTICE TITLED BREAST IMPLANT-ASSOCIATED ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (BIA-ALCL) PROVIDED ON 21/MAR/2017. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CASES REFERENCED IN THE NOTICE IS 359, INCLUDING 9 DEATHS. THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE NOTICE CLASSIFIES THE ALCL EVENTS IN DIFFERENT CATEGORIES, INCLUDING TYPES OF DEVICE, ASSOCIATED ADVERSE EVENTS, PRESENTATION, AND DIAGNOSIS DETAILS, BUT DOES NOT IDENTIFY SPECIFIC DEVICES OR PATIENTS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO INDIVIDUALIZE THIS INFORMATION INTO SPECIFIC REPORTS, AND BY DEFINITION ALREADY INCLUDES EVENTS REPORTED BY ALLERGAN IN THE PAST. THEREFORE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH 21 CFR 803, THIS REPORT WILL REPRESENT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF RECEIPT OF THE NOTICE AND DOCUMENTATION OF ALLERGAN'S ATTEMPT TO INVESTIGATE ADVERSE EVENTS IDENTIFIED IN THAT NOTICE. THIS REPORT WILL NOT SUBSTITUTE FOR ANY INVESTIGATION INTO COMPLAINTS RECEIVED WHERE INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS OR ALLERGAN DEVICES ARE IDENTIFIED, INCLUSIVE OR EXCLUSIVE OF THE 359 CASES MENTIONED IN THE NOTICE. (B)(4). THE EVENTS OF DEATH, LYMPHOMA-ALCL, LYMPHOMA, SEROMA, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, AND BREAST LUMPS ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE DEVICE GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSIST ALLERGAN IN DETERMINING A PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THESE EVENTS. SALINE DEVICE LABELING: RADIATION TO THE BREAST Â¿ ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE IN VIVO EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, PAIN, WRINKLING, ASYMMETRY, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, IMPLANT REMOVAL, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT DEFLATION, SCARRING, INFECTION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE Â¿ PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA, AND THE CHANCE OF IT HAPPENING MAY INCREASE OVER TIME. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OCCURS MORE COMMONLY IN REVISION PATIENTS THAN IN PRIMARY AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION PATIENTS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR IMPLANT DEFLATION, AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR REOPERATION. PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ADVISED THAT ADDITIONAL SURGERY MAY BE NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS ARE SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF. THIS SURGERY MAY RESULT IN LOSS OF BREAST TISSUE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AFTER THESE ADDITIONAL SURGERIES. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF DEFLATION. ADDITIONAL COMPLICATIONS Â¿ AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. CALCIUM DEPOSITS CAN FORM IN THE TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT WITH SYMPTOMS THAT MAY INCLUDE PAIN AND FIRMNESS. LYMPHADENOPATHY HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED IN SOME WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS. IN THE PASS STUDY, AT LEAST 1 REOPERATION WAS PERFORMED ON 315 PATIENTS (36.5%) THROUGH 10 YEARS. A TOTAL OF 424 REOPERATIONS WERE PERFORMED. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR REOPERATION THROUGH 10 YEARS ON AUGMENTATION PATIENTS WAS IMPLANT DEFLATION AT 21.7%. THE PERCENTAGE OF REOPERATIONS DUE TO LUMP/MASS/CYST INCREASED FROM 8.5% OF 293 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 5 YEARS TO 13.9% OF 424 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 10 YEARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF LUMPS, MASSES, AND CYSTS CAN BE EXPECTED TO NATURALLY INCREASE AS PATIENTS AGE AND COULD BE AN EXPLANATION FOR THE INCREASE. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. FOR MORE COMPLETE AND UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ON FDAÂ¿S ANALYSIS AND REVIEW OF THE ALCL IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST IMPLANTS PLEASE VISIT: HTTP://WWW.FDA.GOV/MEDICALDEVICES/PRODUCTSANDMEDICALPROCEDURES/IMPLANTSANDPROSTHETICS/BREASTIMPLANTS/UCM239995.HTM YOU ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO REPORT ANY PRODUCT PROBLEM OR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT TO ALLERGAN. DEATHS MUST BE REPORTED TO ALLERGAN AND FDA. SILICONE DEVICE LABELING: ONE OF THE KEY COMPLICATIONS REPORTED IS CALLED Â¿CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE.Â¿ CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE IS A TIGHTENING OF THE SCAR TISSUE (ALSO CALLED A CAPSULE) THAT NORMALLY FORMS AROUND THE BREAST IMPLANT DURING THE HEALING PROCESS AFTER SURGERY. IN SOME WOMEN, THE SCAR TISSUE (CAPSULE) SQUEEZES THE IMPLANT. THIS RESULTS IN FIRMNESS OR HARDENING OF THE BREAST, AND IT IS A RISK FOR IMPLANT RUPTURE. DEGREES OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE ARE CLASSIFIED BY THE BAKER GRADING SCALE.1 CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BAKER GRADES III AND IV ARE THE MOST SEVERE. BAKER GRADE III OFTEN RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SURGERY (REOPERATION) BECAUSE OF PAIN AND POSSIBLY ABNORMAL APPEARANCE. BAKER GRADE IV USUALLY RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR REOPERATION BECAUSE OF PAIN AND UNACCEPTABLE APPEARANCE. DO NOT TREAT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE BY CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY OR FORCEFUL EXTERNAL COMPRESSION, WHICH WILL LIKELY RESULT IN IMPLANT DAMAGE, RUPTURE, FOLDS, AND/OR HEMATOMA. ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: IMPLANT RUPTURE, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, PAIN, CHANGES IN NIPPLE AND BREAST SENSATION, INFECTION, SCARRING, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY, BREASTFEEDING COMPLICATIONS, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/CHEST WALL DEFORMITY, CALCIUM DEPOSITS, AND LYMPHADENOPATHY. SIMILAR TO A BRUISE, A SEROMA OCCURS WHEN THE WATERY PORTION OF THE BLOOD COLLECTS AROUND A SURGICAL INCISION OR AROUND A BREAST IMPLANT. YOU SHOULD PERFORM SELF-EXAMINATION OF YOUR BREASTS EVERY MONTH FOR CANCER SCREENING. HOWEVER, THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU DISTINGUISH THE IMPLANT FROM YOUR BREAST TISSUE. THE PRESENCE OF LUMPS, PERSISTENT PAIN, SWELLING, HARDENING, OR CHANGES IN IMPLANT SHAPE, MAY BE SIGNS OF A RUPTURE OF THE IMPLANT. THESE SIGNS SHOULD BE REPORTED TO YOUR SURGEON AND POSSIBLY EVALUATED WITH AN MRI. AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THE FOLLOWING MAY OCCUR AND/OR PERSIST, WITH VARYING INTENSITY AND/OR FOR A VARYING LENGTH OF TIME: HEMATOMA/SEROMA, IMPLANT EXTRUSION, NECROSIS, DELAYED WOUND HEALING, AND BREAST TISSUE ATROPHY/ CHEST WALL DEFORMITY. ALCL IS NOT BREAST CANCER; IT IS A RARE TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA, A CANCER INVOLVING THE CELLS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. BASED ON INFORMATION REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKINÂ¿S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT.

BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES. BREAST IMPLANTS RUPTURE WHEN THE SHELL DEVELOPS A TEAR OR HOLE. RUPTURES CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER IMPLANTATION, BUT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THE LONGER THE IMPLANT IS IMPLANTED. THE FOLLOWING THINGS MAY CAUSE IMPLANTS TO RUPTURE: DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS, STRESSING THE IMPLANT DURING IMPLANTATION AND WEAKENING IT, FOLDING OR WRINKLING OF THE IMPLANT SHELL, EXCESSIVE FORCE TO THE CHEST (E.G., DURING CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, WHICH IS CONTRAINDICATED), TRAUMA, COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING, AND SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. BREAST IMPLANTS MAY ALSO SIMPLY WEAR OUT OVER TIME. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE CAUSES OF RUPTURE FOR ALLERGANÂ¿S PRODUCT. IT IS NOT CONCLUSIVELY KNOWN WHETHER THESE TESTS HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL CAUSES OF RUPTURE. LABORATORY STUDIES TO IDENTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RUPTURE ARE ONGOING. SILICONE GEL-FILLED IMPLANT RUPTURES ARE MOST OFTEN SILENT. THIS MEANS THAT MOST OF THE TIME NEITHER YOU NOR YOUR PATIENT WILL KNOW IF THE IMPLANT HAS A TEAR OR HOLE IN THE SHELL. MRI EXAMINATION IS CURRENTLY THE BEST METHOD TO SCREEN FOR RUPTURE. SOMETIMES THERE ARE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH GEL IMPLANT RUPTURE. THESE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE HARD KNOTS OR LUMPS SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT OR IN THE ARMPIT, CHANGE OR LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF THE BREAST OR IMPLANT, PAIN, TINGLING, SWELLING, NUMBNESS, BURNING, AND HARDENING OF THE BREAST. WHEN MRI SIGNS OF RUPTURE ARE FOUND (SUCH AS SUBCAPSULAR LINES, CHARACTERISTIC FOLDED WAVY LINES, TEARDROP SIGN, KEYHOLE SIGN, NOOSE SIGN), OR IF THERE ARE SIGNS OR SYMPTOMS OF RUPTURE, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND ANY GEL YOU DETERMINE YOUR PATIENT HAS, WITH OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. IT ALSO MAY BE NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE TISSUE CAPSULE. THERE ARE ALSO CONSEQUENCES OF RUPTURE. IF RUPTURE OCCURS, SILICONE GEL MAY EITHER REMAIN WITHIN THE SCAR TISSUE CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT (INTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), MOVE OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE (EXTRACAPSULAR RUPTURE), OR MOVE OUTSIDE THE BREAST (GEL MIGRATION).

FINALLY I WENT TO THE DOCTOR AND UNDER ULTRASOUND THEY REMOVED 3 LARGE CONTAINERS OF BLOOD TINGED FLUID FROM MY LEFT BREAST. UNFORTUNATELY THE FLUID ALL CAME BACK AND MORE. SO MY PLASTIC SURGEON SAID WE NEED TO REMOVE THE IMPLANT AND I AGREED. AT MY REQUEST HE REMOVED BOTH IMPLANTS THIS TIME. AFTER THE SURGERY MY DOCTOR TOLD ME IT WAS A GOOD THING HE TOOK THAT OUT. HE SAID IT WAS A MESS, SEROMA, BLOOD CLOTS AND CAPSULATED. HE SAID HE HAD TO DO A LOT TO CLEAN IT ALL OUT. I SUGGESTED HE TEST FOR CANCER THAT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH TEXTURED IMPLANTS AND SEROMAS.

BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. REPORTS IN THE MEDICAL LITERATURE INDICATE THAT PATIENTS WITH BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT AT A GREATER RISK THAN THOSE WITHOUT BREAST IMPLANTS FOR DEVELOPING BREAST CANCER. REPORTS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT BREAST IMPLANTS MAY INTERFERE WITH OR DELAY BREAST CANCER DETECTION BY MAMMOGRAPHY AND/OR BIOPSY; HOWEVER, OTHER REPORTS IN THE PUBLISHED MEDICAL LITERATURE INDICATE THAT BREAST IMPLANTS NEITHER SIGNIFICANTLY DELAY BREAST CANCER DETECTION NOR ADVERSELY AFFECT CANCER SURVIVAL OF WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS. A LARGE FOLLOW-UP STUDY REPORTED NO EVIDENCE OF AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND CANCER, AND EVEN SHOWED A DECREASED INCIDENCE OF BREAST CANCER COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION. ONE STUDY HAS REPORTED AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF BRAIN CANCER IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS AS COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION. THE INCIDENCE OF BRAIN CANCER, HOWEVER, WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS WHEN COMPARED TO WOMEN WHO HAD OTHER PLASTIC SURGERIES A PUBLISHED REVIEW OF 4 LARGE STUDIES IN WOMEN WITH COSMETIC IMPLANTS AND AN ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP STUDY CONCLUDED THAT THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT SUPPORT AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BRAIN CANCER AND BREAST IMPLANTS. AN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL REVIEW ALSO LENT SUPPORT TO THE LACK OF CAUSATION BETWEEN IMPLANTS AND ANY TYPE OF CANCER. STUDIES HAVE REPORTED AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF RESPIRATORY/LUNG CANCER IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS. OTHER STUDIES OF WOMEN IN SWEDEN AND DENMARK HAVE FOUND THAT WOMEN WHO GET BREAST IMPLANTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE CURRENT SMOKERS THAN WOMEN WHO GET BREAST REDUCTION SURGERY OR OTHER TYPES OF COSMETIC SURGERY. SEVERAL LARGE STUDIES HAVE FOUND NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND RESPIRATORY/LUNG CANCER. TWO STUDIES REPORTED AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF CERVICAL/VULVAR CANCER IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS. ANOTHER LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP STUDY SHOWED EQUIVALENT INCIDENCES OF CERVICAL CANCER IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS COMPARED TO THE GENERAL POPULATION. OTHER RECENT LARGE STUDIES CONCLUDED THAT THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT SUPPORT AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM CANCERS AND BREAST IMPLANTS. THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL STUDIES PUBLISHED THAT EXAMINED THE RISK OF OTHER TYPES OF CANCERS, E.G., THYROID CANCERS, URINARY SYSTEM CANCERS, SARCOMA, ENDOCRINE CANCER, CONNECTIVE TISSUE CANCER, CANCER OF THE EYE, AND UNSPECIFIED CANCERS IN WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS.

DEVICE LABELING: ACTIVE INFECTION ANYWHERE IN THE BODY MAY INCREASE RISK OF PERIPROSTHETIC INFECTION. DO NOT EXPOSE THE TISSUE EXPANDER OR INJECTION NEEDLES TO CONTAMINANTS, WHICH INCREASE THE RISK OF INFECTION. PATIENTS WHO PRESENT WOUND DEHISCENCE, TISSUE EROSION, ISCHEMIA OR NECROSIS RUN AN INCREASED RISK OF PERIPROSTHETIC INFECTION. MEASURES TO PROTECT SUCH AREAS FROM INFECTION SHOULD BE TAKEN. SIGNS OF ACUTE INFECTION REPORTED IN ASSOCIATION WITH TISSUE EXPANDERS INCLUDE, TENDERNESS, FLUID ACCUMULATION, PAIN AND FEVER. INFECTION MAY COMPROMISE THE EXPANSION PROCESS. POSTOPERATIVE INFECTIONS SHOULD BE TREATED AGGRESSIVELY ACCORDING TO STANDARD MEDICAL PRACTICES TO AVOID MORE SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS. INFECTION THAT IS UNRESPONSIVE TO TREATMENT OR NECROTIZING INFECTION MAY REQUIRE PREMATURE TISSUE EXPANDER REMOVAL. INFECTION IS AN INHERENT RISK FOLLOWING ANY TYPE OF INVASIVE SURGERY, AND MAY OCCUR DURING THE TISSUE EXPANSION PROCESS. PATIENTS WHO PRESENT WITH WOUND DEHISCENCE, TISSUE EROSION, ISCHEMIA OR NECROSIS, AND PATIENTS UNDERGOING IMMEDIATE BREAST RECONSTRUCTION RUN AN INCREASED RISK OF PERIPROSTHETIC INFECTION. SIGNS OF ACUTE INFECTION REPORTED IN ASSOCIATION WITH TISSUE EXPANDERS INCLUDE ERYTHEMA, TENDERNESS, FLUID ACCUMULATION, PAIN AND FEVER. ERYTHEMA MAY ALSO OCCUR AS A NORMAL RESPONSE TO EXPANSION. ASPIRATION TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THIS TYPE OF ERYTHEMA AND ERYTHEMA AS A SIGN OF EARLY INFECTION IS A RECOGNIZED PRECAUTION.

ESCHERICHIA AND STREPTOCOCCUS ORGANISMS HAVE ALSO BEEN NOTED IN ASSOCIATION WITH TISSUE EXPANDERS IN THE LOWER EXTREMITIES. INFECTION MAY OCCUR AT ANY TIME AFTER SURGERY, AND MAY COMPROMISE THE EXPANSION PROCESS. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE RELATED TO INFECTION IN THE AREA SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT. POSTOPERATIVE INFECTIONS SHOULD BE TREATED AGGRESSIVELY ACCORDING TO STANDARD MEDICAL PRACTICES TO AVOID MORE SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS. INFECTION THAT IS UNRESPONSIVE TO TREATMENT OR NECROTIZING INFECTION MAY REQUIRE PREMATURE BREAST TISSUE EXPANDER REMOVAL. IN RARE INSTANCES, ACUTE INFECTION MAY OCCUR IN A BREAST WITH IMPLANTS. THE SIGNS OF ACUTE INFECTION INCLUDE ERYTHEMA, TENDERNESS, FLUID ACCUMULATION,PAIN, AND FEVER.

IT IS CHARACTERIZED BY SYMPTOMS THAT OCCUR SUDDENLY AND INCLUDE HIGH FEVER (102Â°F, 38.8Â°C OR HIGHER), VOMITING, DIARRHEA, A SUNBURN-LIKE RASH, RED EYES, DIZZINESS, LIGHTHEADEDNESS, MUSCLE ACHES, AND DROPS IN BLOOD PRESSURE, WHICH MAY CAUSE FAINTING. PATIENTS SHOULD BE ADVISED TO CONTACT A PHYSICIAN IMMEDIATELY FOR DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT FOR ANY OF THESE SYMPTOMS. POSTOPERATIVE HEMATOMA AND SEROMA MAY CONTRIBUTE TO INFECTION. POSTOPERATIVE HEMATOMA AND SEROMA MAY BE MINIMIZED BY METICULOUS ATTENTION TO HEMOSTASIS DURING SURGERY, AND POSSIBLY BY POSTOPERATIVE USE OF CLOSED DRAINS. PERSISTENT, EXCESSIVE BLEEDING MUST BE CONTROLLED BEFORE THE DEVICE IS IMPLANTED.

AFTER HAVING MY SECOND DAUGHTER IN 7/71, PROBLEMS I HAD WITH BOTH MY BREASTS WERE GETTING WORSE. HAVING BEEN SEEN BY MY GENERAL PRACTITIONER, I WAS SENT FOR SCAN ON BOTH BREASTS. FIBROCYSTIC MASTITIS WAS DIAGNOSED, AND I ALSO HAD GREEN FLUID OOZING FROM BOTH NIPPLES ACCOMPANIED WITH SEVERE PAIN. THE TREATMENT I WAS ON WAS DANAZOL, BUT TO NO AVAIL. I SAW MY GENERAL PRACTITIONER AGAIN WHO THEN MADE ME AN APPOINTMENT TO SEE BREAST SURGEON. I HAD NO FURTHER SCANS THAT REVEALED I HAD FIBROCYSTIC MASTITIS; BY THAT TIME FLUID FROM BOTH MY NIPPLES HAD BECOME EMERALD GREEN COLOR, REALLY DARK GREEN, ALSO WITH PAIN BECOMING WORSE. I WAS TOLD TO WRAP HOT WATER BOTTLE IN TOWEL AND PLACE TO MY BREAST; AND I WAS GIVEN PAIN CONTROL DRUGS. I STOOD PAIN UNTIL I COULD NO MORE. IN 6/90, I SAW BREAST SURGEON AGAIN, ASKING HIM IF THERE WAS WAY HE COULD RELIEVE ME FROM TERRIBLE PAIN I WAS IN. I WAS TOLD THAT THERE COULD ONLY BE ONE SOLUTION, AND THAT WAS TO HAVE DOUBLE MASTECTOMY. HE WOULD ONLY DO IT IF I WAS TO HAVE SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. I AGREED. I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE. IN 8/89 I HAD BILATERAL ""MAMMADOCHECTOMY."" THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT EITHER, SO THAT'S WHY I ASKED FOR MASTECTOMY. I SAW BREAST SURGEON WHO REFERRED ME TO PLASTIC SURGEON, AND OPERATION WAS A JOINT ONE. THE BREAST WAS REMOVED, AND BREAST TISSUE DOWN TO MUSCLE (SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY); AND IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION WITH SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. THIS WAS CARRIED OUT IN 1990. I HAD BILATERAL SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY DEEP DOWN TO PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE, IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS IN 1990. THE IMPLANTS BECAME EXPOSED DUE TO SCARS GAPING OPEN, FLUID WAS OOZING OUT. SWABS TAKEN OF FLUID REVEALED AFTER CULTURED PLASMA (KLEBSIELLA AEROGENES). I WAS GIVEN IV 500 MG METRONIDAZOLE, TETRACYCLINE/FLUCLOXACILLIN/PAIN KILLERS TYLOX. I HAD BLOOD TRANSFUSION AND IMPLANTS REMOVED FOLLOWING DAY. I WAS TOLD WHAT HAPPENED WAS JUST A ONE IN A MILLION CHANCE OF EVER HAPPENING, AND THAT I COULD HAVE SECOND ATTEMPT OF BEING REINSERTED WITH THE BREAST IMPLANTS AFTER 8 MOS. I TOOK SURGEON'S OFFER, AND HAD SECOND ATTEMPT OF HAVING SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLANTS. AGAIN IN 1991 I HAD INSERTION OF BREAST IMPLANTS YET AGAIN. IN 1992 I ALSO HAD TO HAVE THEM REMOVED DUE TO SYSTEMIC INFECTION. IN 1997, I CAME ACROSS THE PACKAGE INSERT AND PRODUCT DATA SHEET, CLEARLY STATING THAT MASTITIS OR ANY ACTIVE INFECTION IS CONTRAINDICATED TO USE OF BREAST IMPLANTS MADE FROM SILICONE GEL. I AM SO ILL WITH FIBRO-FATTY CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDER, ACCOMPANIED WITH SEVERE PAIN, PROMINENTLY MARKED VASCULARITY, FIBROMYALGIA, CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME, HYPOTHYROIDISM, PLANTAR FASCIITIS, ARTHRITIS IN KNEES, HANDS AND BACK. I EXPERIENCE NOW SEVERE PAIN IN HANDS, FINGERS, ARMS, THIGHS, BUTTOCKS CHEEKS, HIPS, AND CALVES OF BOTH LEGS. I HAVE LOSS OF BALANCE, LOSS OF WORDS, CONCENTRATION PROBLEMS, DRY EYES, MOUTH, NOSE AND VAGINA. I ALSO HAVE A LOT OF INFECTIONS, BREATHING DIFFICULTY, BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS, THRUSH IN MOUTH/VAGINA, CHEST INFECTIONS, THROAT INFECTIONS, EAR INFECTIONS, BOWEL DISORDER, AND BLADDER PROBLEMS. I HAVE WIDESPREAD PAPILLOMAS, CHEST THROUGH ARMS AND NECK. I HAVE FIBROS TISSUE IN MY JOINTS. I ALSO HAVE PAIN IN MY HEAD; IT IS NOT A HEADACHE, IT IS LIKE WHEN INFECTION AND PUSS THROB LIKE PAIN. LOSS OF SLEEP, DROPPING THINGS, BUMPING INTO THINGS, ELECTRIC SHOCK - LIKE WHEN YOU TOUCH BARE WIRES ON ELECTRICAL GOODS, IF I TOUCH ANYTHING METAL. CRAWLING SENSATION IF I TOUCH NYLON, DRYLON, LEATHER OR POLYESTER; IF I USE TALC PERFUMED AND COLORED SOAP. I ALSO HAVE FOOD ALLERGIES. DUE TO HAVING BACTERIAL INFECTIONS I STILL EVEN TODAY TAKE METRONIDAZOLE, ANTIBIOTICS, AND ANTIFUNGAL MEDICATION TOO. I FEEL VERY WEAK, I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING CHRONIC FLU-LIKE SYMPTOMS, BUT I DON'T HAVE THE FLU. I CAN ONLY STAND, EVEN WALK SHORT PACES BEFORE BECOMING EXHAUSTED, AND MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE SEVERE PAIN I SUFFER FROM. I'M IN MY EARLY 40'S, BUT AT THIS MOMENT I FEEL LIKE 90, AND IT ISN'T RIGHT. DOCTORS I'M UNDER DON'T KNOW HOW TO BEGIN TO TREAT ME. HOWEVER, THEY KNOW WHAT CAUSE IS BUT AT THIS MOMENT CANNOT OFFER ANY KIND OF TREATMENT. I AM A TEST CASE OVER HERE OF THE DOCTORS WHO ARE DEALING WITH ME. LET'S HOPE SOMETHING CAN BE DONE PRETTY SOON. I DO BLAME SURGEONS FOR THEIR IGNORANCE AND STUPIDITY OF WAY THEY HAVE TREATED ME IN THE FIRST PLACE. TO BEGIN WITH, FOR IGNORING THE PRODUCT DATA SHEETS OF ALL BREAST IMPLANTS, ALONG WITH IGNORING THE PACKAGE INSERTS TOO. I HAVE LOST ALL TRUST AND FAITH IN MEDICAL PROFESSION. THE GOVERNMENT: FOR REFUSING TO CARRY OUT ANY KIND OF RESEARCH OR TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE LIKE ME WITH SAME ILLNESS; TREATMENT WE NEED SO DESPERATELY TO GET WELL. I KNOW I'M AS TOUGH AS NAILS. I DON'T INTEND TO SIT BACK AND DO NOTHING. I'M DETERMINED TO GET SOMEWHERE AND GET TREATMENT I SO DESPERATELY NEED. UP UNTIL 1989 I USED TO WORK FULL TIME, 16 HRS A DAY IN A CUTLERY FACTORY. I ALSO TOOK CARE OF MY MOM WHO DIED FROM TERMINAL CANCER BACK IN 1985. I ALSO TOOK CARE OF MY FATHER WHO ALSO DIED FROM A TERMINAL DISEASE. BOTH OF MY PARENTS DIED FROM CHEST ILLNESSES, MOST OF MY FATHER'S FAMILY DIED FROM TUBERCULOSIS, LUNG CANCER, HEART ATTACKS, AND STROKES. IN MY MOM'S FAMILY THEY DIED OF LUNG/BREAST CANCER ETHACENIA. THEY ALL WENT TO OPEN AIR SCHOOL. I WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS BORN IN PERFECT HEALTH, THAT IS UNTIL I MARRIED AND HAD CHILDREN AT THE AGE OF 16."" HISTORY: PT SUFFERED FROM CHRONIC BREAST PAIN FOR A PERIOD OF APPROX 20 YRS AND WHICH WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CYSTIC MASTITIS. VARIOUS CONSERVATIVE, DRUG TREATMENT REGIMES WERE TRIED TO HELP HER WITH THIS PROBLEM BUT TO NO AVAIL. SHE DESCRIBES HAVING A COLORED DISCHARGE COMING FROM HER NIPPLES IN ADDITION TO THE PAIN. SHE CAME UNDER THE CARE OF A CONSULTANT GENERAL SURGEON WHO PERFORMED AN OPERATION ON HER BREAST DUCTS IN 1989.

I HAD INFILTRATING LOBULAR CARCINOMA AND HAD RECONSTRUCTION AT THE SAME TIME WITH A PLASTIC SURGEON WHO HAD DONE WORK PREVIOUSLY ON MY BREASTS. I WAS FITTED WITH A SALINE EXPANDER. THE PLASTIC SURGEON THE VERY NEXT MORNING AT THE HOSP TOLD ME HE THOUGHT IT HAD RUPTURED AND TO CALL HIM TO MAKE A DATE TO HAVE IT REPLACED AT HIS SURGICAL SUITE. I DID...HE REPLACED IT AND I STARTED TO HAVE PROBLEMS...MY BODY WAS REJECTING THE SALINE...KEPT HAVING CONTRACTURES AND STARTED TO RIDE HIGH AND WAS MOVING UPWARDS. WENT BACK TO THE PLASTIC SURGEON AND WE DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITIES AND HE SUGGESTED I HAVE IT REPLACED WITH THE SAME POLYURETHANE IMPLANT WHICH HE HAD PUT IN, ON 7/6/90, RIGHT AND LEFT BREAST AFTER TAKING THE TWO SILICONES OUT FOR THE SAME REASONS. HE SAID THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE THE FORMATION OF THE SCAR TISSUE WITH THE CAPSULAR CONTRACTIONS. THIS IS HOW I WAS GIVEN A POLYURETHANE COATED IMPLANT IN MY LEFT BREAST (CANCER SIDE - MASTECTOMY). HISTORY: IN 1988 WENT TO SEE THIS PLASTIC SURGEON WHO WAS REFERRED TO ME TO SEE IF HE COULD POSSIBLY STITCH BOTH MY BREASTS UP FOR THEY HAD BECOME EMPTY SACS AFTER I STOPPED MENSTRUATING AND HIS SOLUTION WAS TO AUGMENT THEM AND AFTER CONSIDERATION HE DID AND PUT IN TWO SILICONE IMPLANTS. IN TIME THESE STARTED TO GIVE ME PAIN AND HAD CAPSULAR CONTRACTIONS AND THEY STARTED RIDING HIGH AND THEY WERE SO SEVERE THAT HE SUGGESTED THAT WITH HIS PTS WITH THIS PROBLEM HE OPTED FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE SILICONE AND REPLACE THEM WITH 2 POLYURETHANE IMPLANTS WHICH WOULD ADHERE BETTER AND YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SUCH CONTRACTIONS. I DID THIS AND HAD THIS PROCEDURE PERFORMED AT HIS SURGICAL SUITE ON 7/2/90. SEE NOTES AT END OF HISTORY OF IMPLANTS. HAD REGULAR MAMMOGRAMS AND IN THE LATTER PART OF 1991 I WAS FEELING A LUMP IN MY LEFT BREAST EVEN THOUGH THE LATEST MAMMOGRAM DID NOT SHOW ANYTHING. I REQUESTED ANOTHER MAMMOGRAM AT A DIFFERENT LOCATION AND THIS SHOWED NOTHING. ASKED MY DR IF I COULD HAVE A WRITTEN PRESCRIPTION TO HAVE A SONOGRAM PERFORMED AND I DID AND SURE ENOUGH I DID HAVE A LUMP. WENT TO SEE MY PLASTIC SURGEON AND HE REFERRED ME TO THE ONE OF THE FINEST BREAST SURGEONS. WENT TO SEE HIM FIRST OF JANUARY AND HE SCHEDULED ME FOR A BIOPSY ON 1/13/92 AND WHEN WE GOT THE REPORT BACK IT WAS CANCEROUS AND SO I WENT TO SEE HIM THE NEXT DAY AND WE DISCUSSED THE DIFFERENT PROCEDURES, ETC. AND HE BOOKED ME FOR SURGERY ON 1/21/1992. I OPTED FOR A MODIFIED RADICAL MASTECTOMY BECAUSE I DID HAVE THE SILICONE IMPLANT IN THE BREAST AND WAS DEVASTED WITH THE FACT THAT I HAD CANCER. I HAD THIS PROCEDURE AND HAD THE SAME PLASTIC SURGEON DO THE RECONSTRUCTION WITH A SALINE EXPANDER. THE VERY NEXT MORNING THE PLASTIC SURGEON TOLD ME AT THE HOSP THAT HE WAS SURE THE SALINE HAD RUPTURED AND TO CALL HIM THE FOLLOWING WEEK TO SET UP AN APPOINTMENT TO REPLACE THE SALINE, WHICH I DID.

THE IMPLANTS WERE REPLACED ONCE BILATERALLY, AND RPTR CLAIMS SHE HAS HAD ONE BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY, BEGINNING WITH THE FIRST IMPLANT SURGERY. SHE CURRENTLY DOES NOT HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. RPTR CLAIMS THAT BILATERALLY THE IMPLANTS: RUPTURED, HAD BLEEDING THROUGH THE ENVELOPE, AND WERE ASSOCIATED WITH A SURGICAL AREA INFECTION. RPTR HAD ONE CLOSE CAPSULOTOMY AS TREATMENT FOR ONE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE.

MD REPORT STATES: THE RIGHT SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT APPEARS TO HAVE MAINTAINED ITS STRUCTURAL SHAPE AND ELASTOMER INTEGRITY. UPON CLOSE EXAMINATION THE ELASTOMER SURFACE APPEARS DRY AND DEVOID OF ANY LUSTROUS APPEARANCE. THE SILICONE GEL WAS TRANSPARENT AND COLORLESS, BUT CONTAINED SOME PRECIPITATED PARTICLES. THE NATURE OF THE PRECIPITATED PARTICLES NOTED ABOVE WAS NOT POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED BECAUSE TO DO SO WOULD HAVE REQUIRED DAMAGING THE ELASTOMER MEMBRANE AND RUINING THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE PROSTHETIC DEVICE. NEVERTHELESS, THE PRECIPITATED PARTICLES APPEAR SIMILAR TO AGGREGATES STUDIES IN OTHER RUPTURED DEVICES. MICROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF THESE PARTICLES REVEALS THAT THEY ARE COTTON-LIKE PARACRYSTALLINE FORMATIONS. THESE FORMATIONS WERE FOUND TO BE CHEMICAL RATHER THAN BIOLOGICAL IN ORIGIN. THE LEFT SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT, UNLIKE ITS COUNTERPART, WAS RUPTURED AND SILICONE GEL WAS EXTERNALIZED. THE SILICONE GEL WAS TRANSPARENT, COLORLESS, AND DID NOT CONTAIN ANY AGGREGATED PARTICLES. THE PATHOLOGY SECTION OF THIS REPORT REVEALS THAT CELLULAR REACTIVE CHANGES OCCURRED RESULTING IN THE FORMATION OF A FIBROCONNECTIVE TISSUE CAPSULE. THIS CAPSULE DISPLAYS SIGNS OF CHRONIC INFLAMMATION. IT CONTAINS FOREIGN BODIES IN TISSUE CELLS AND FIBERS. THE SEARCH REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF SILICONE PARTICLES INFILTRATING THE BREAST CAPSULE TISSUE. THE PARTICLES WERE OBSERVED COATING THE WALLS OF THE EXTRACELLULAR SPACES BETWEEN THE TISSUE FIBERS AND CELL PARENCHYMA. THE ENLARGED PRINTS ILLUSTRATE THE SILICONE PARTICLES IN A BRIGHT OFF-WHITE COLOR THAT STANDS OUT AGAINST THE TISSUE AND BACKGROUND WHICH ARE PURPLE AND BLUE, RESPECTIVELY. THE PRESENCE AND LOCATION OF THE SILICONE GEL PARTICLES IN THESE TISSUES INDICATE THAT THEY HAD MIGRATED FROM A RUPTURED AND/OR BLEEDING IMPLANT. THE BREAST TISSUE REACTED TO THEIR PRESENCE BY FRAGMENTING THE EXTRUDED SILICONE GEL INTO MICROSCOPIC PARTICLES AND ENCAPSULATING THEM WITHIN FIBROUS TISSUE. THESE PROCESSES OCCURRED OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME AND DID NOT RESULT FROM ANY SILICONE LEAKAGE/RUPTURE THAT MAY HAVE OCCURRED DURING SURGERY FOR THEIR REMOVAL. GROSS DESCRIPTION: LABELED AS ""RIGHT BREAST IMPLANT"", THIS SPECIMEN CAME IN A PLASTIC CONTAINER INTACT. THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF BLEEDING OR RUPTURE. THE SILICONE GEL IS COLORLESS BUT SOME PRECIPITATE IS NOTICED INSIDE THE GEL. THE IMPLANT CONTAINS 225CC OF FLUID. THE IMPLANT WEIGHS 228.7 GRAMS AND MEASURES 12CM IN DIAMETER. LABELED AS ""LEFT BREAST IMPLANT"", THIS SPECIMEN CAME IN A PLASTIC CONTAINER RUPTURED. THE RUPTURE POINT IS 2CM IN LENGTH AND SILICONE GEL CAN BE SEEN PROTRUDING THROUGH THE ORIFICE. THE GEL IS CLEAR AND NO PRECIPITATE IS NOTICED. THE IMPLANT MEASURES 12.5CM IN DIAMETER AND WEIGHS 226.2 GRAMS. OPERATIVE REPORT: THIS IS A 52 YEAR OLD WHITE FEMALE WHO REQUESTED REMOVAL OF HER BILATERAL BREAST PROSTHESES. THIS PT UNDERWENT SILICONE BREAST AUGMENTATION IN 6/86 AND NOW RELATES A HISTORY OF JOINT PAINS AND RINGING IN HER EARS SINCE 3/92. AT THE TIME OF INITIAL CONSULTATION THE POSSIBILITY OF REPLACING THE IMPLANTS WITH SALINE FILLED PROSTHESES WAS DISCUSSED AND HER HUSBAND APPEARED TO FAVOR THIS. HOWEVER, THE PT WAS ADAMANT THAT SHE WANTED NO IMPLANTS AT ALL AND THEREFORE IT WAS MENTIONED THAT HER BREASTS WOULD BE SOMEWHAT PTOTIC AFTER THE SURGERY. SURGICAL PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION REPORT: THE SPECIMEN IS RECEIVED IN THE FRESH STATE, LABELLED WITH THE PT'S NAME AND ACCESSION NUMBER AS ""SALIVARY GLAND BIOPSY"", AND CONSISTS OF ONE IRREGULAR PIECE OF PINK, TAN, AND RED SOFT TISSUE MEASURING 0.8X 0.7X 0.4CM.

AFTER HAVING MY SECOND DAUGHTER IN 7/71, THE PROBLEMS I HAD WITH BOTH MY BREASTS WERE GETTING WORSE. HAVING BEEN SEEN BY MY GENERAL PRACTITIONER, I WAS SENT FOR SCAN ON BOTH BREASTS. FIBROCYSTIC MASTITIS WAS DIAGNOSED; I ALSO HAD GREEN FLUID OOZING FROM BOTH NIPPLES ACCOMPANIED WITH SEVERE PAIN. THE TREATMENT I WAS ON WAS DANAZOL, BUT TO NO AVAIL. I SAW MY GENERAL PRACTITIONER AGAIN WHO THEN MADE ME APPOINTMENT TO SEE BREAST SURGEON. I HAD NO FURTHER SCANS THAT REVEALED I HAD FIBROCYSTIC MASTITIS; BY THAT TIME FLUID FROM BOTH MY NIPPLES HAD BECOME EMERALD GREEN COLOR, REALLY DARK GREEN, ALSO WITH PAIN BECOMING WORSE. I WAS TOLD TO WRAP HOT WATER BOTTLE IN TOWEL AND PLACE TO MY BREAST; AND I WAS GIVEN PAIN CONTROL DRUGS. I STOOD THE PAIN UNTIL I COULD NO MORE. IN 6/90, I SAW BREAST SURGEON AGAIN, ASKING HIM IF THERE WAS A WAY HE COULD RELIEVE ME FROM TERRIBLE PAIN I WAS IN. I WAS TOLD THAT THERE COULD ONLY BE ONE SOLUTION, AND THAT WAS TO HAVE DOUBLE MASTECTOMY. HE WOULD ONLY DO IT IF I WAS TO HAVE SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. I AGREED. I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE. IN 8/89 I HAD BILATERAL ""MAMMADOCHECTOMY."" THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT EITHER, SO THAT'S WHY I ASKED FOR MASTECTOMY. I SAW BREAST SURGEON WHO REFERRED ME TO PLASTIC SURGEON, AND THE OPERATION WAS A JOINT ONE. THE BREAST WAS REMOVED, AND BREAST TISSUE DOWN TO MUSCLE (SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY); AND IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION WITH SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. THIS WAS CARRIED OUT IN 1990. I HAD BILATERAL SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY DEEP DOWN TO PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE, IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS IN 1990. THE IMPLANTS BECAME EXPOSED DUE TO SCARS GAPING OPEN, FLUID WAS OOZING OUT. SWABS TAKEN OF FLUID REVEALED AFTER CULTURED PLASMA (KLEBSIELLA AEROGENES). I WAS GIVEN IV 500 MG METRONIDAZOLE, TETRACYCLINE/FLUCLOXACILLIN/PAIN KILLERS TYLOX. I HAD BLOOD TRANSFUSION AND THE IMPLANTS REMOVED THE FOLLOWING DAY. I WAS TOLD WHAT HAPPENED WAS JUST A ONE IN A MILLION CHANCE OF EVER HAPPENING, AND THAT I COULD HAVE SECOND ATTEMPT OF BEING REINSERTED WITH THE BREAST IMPLANTS AFTER 8 MOS. I TOOK SURGEON'S OFFER, AND HAD SECOND ATTEMPT OF HAVING SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLANTS. AGAIN IN 1991 I HAD INSERTION OF BREAST IMPLANTS YET AGAIN. IN 1992 I ALSO HAD TO HAVE THEM REMOVED DUE TO SYSTEMIC INFECTION. IN 1997, I CAME ACROSS THE PACKAGE INSERT AND PRODUCT DATA SHEET, CLEARLY STATING THAT MASTITIS OR ANY ACTIVE INFECTION IS CONTRAINDICATED TO THE USE OF BREAST IMPLANTS MADE FROM SILICONE GEL.

226777|15491731|D|1||"RPTR WRITES, ""AFTER HAVING MY DAUGHTER IN 6/70 I HAD PROBLEMS WITH BOTH MY BREASTS. AFTER HAVING MY SECOND DAUGHTER IN 7/71, THE PROBLEMS I HAD WITH BOTH MY BREASTS WERE GETTING WORSE. HAVING BEEN SEEN BY MY GENERAL PRACTITIONER, I WAS SENT FOR SCAN ON BOTH BREASTS. FIBROCYSTIC MASTITIS WAS DIAGNOSED; I ALSO HAD GREEN FLUID OOZING FROM BOTH NIPPLES ACCOMPANIED WITH SEVERE PAIN. THE TREATMENT I WAS ON WAS DANAZOL, BUT TO NO AVAIL. I SAW MY GENERAL PRACTITIONER AGAIN WHO THEN MADE ME APPOINTMENT TO SEE BREAST SURGEON. I HAD NO FURTHER SCANS THAT REVEALED I HAD FIBROCYSTIC MASTITIS; BY THAT TIME FLUID FROM BOTH MY NIPPLES HAD BECOME EMERALD GREEN COLOR, REALLY DARK GREEN, ALSO WITH PAIN BECOMING WORSE. I WAS TOLD TO WRAP HOT WATER BOTTLE IN TOWEL AND PLACE TO MY BREAST; AND I WAS GIVEN PAIN CONTROL DRUGS. I STOOD THE PAIN UNTIL I COULD NO MORE. IN 6/90, I SAW BREAST SURGEON AGAIN, ASKING HIM IF THERE WAS A WAY HE COULD RELIEVE ME FROM TERRIBLE PAIN I WAS IN. I WAS TOLD THAT THERE COULD ONLY BE ONE SOLUTION, AND THAT WAS TO HAVE DOUBLE MASTECTOMY. HE WOULD ONLY DO IT IF I WAS TO HAVE SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. I AGREED. I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE. IN 8/89 I HAD BILATERAL ""MAMMADOCHECTOMY."" THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT EITHER, SO THAT'S WHY I ASKED FOR MASTECTOMY. I SAW BREAST SURGEON WHO REFERRED ME TO PLASTIC SURGEON, AND THE OPERATION WAS A JOINT ONE. THE BREAST WAS REMOVED, AND BREAST TISSUE DOWN TO MUSCLE (SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY); AND IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION WITH SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. THIS WAS CARRIED OUT IN 1990. I HAD BILATERAL SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY DEEP DOWN TO PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE, IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS IN 1990. THE IMPLANTS BECAME EXPOSED DUE TO SCARS GAPING OPEN, FLUID WAS OOZING OUT. SWABS TAKEN OF FLUID REVEALED AFTER CULTURED PLASMA (KLEBSIELLA AEROGENES). I WAS GIVEN IV 500 MG METRONIDAZOLE, TETRACYCLINE/FLUCLOXACILLIN/PAIN KILLERS TYLOX. I HAD BLOOD TRANSFUSION AND THE IMPLANTS REMOVED THE FOLLOWING DAY. I WAS TOLD WHAT HAPPENED WAS JUST A ONE IN A MILLION CHANCE OF EVER HAPPENING, AND THAT I COULD HAVE SECOND ATTEMPT OF BEING REINSERTED WITH THE BREAST IMPLANTS AFTER 8 MOS. I TOOK SURGEON'S OFFER, AND HAD SECOND ATTEMPT OF HAVING SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLANTS. AGAIN IN 1991 I HAD INSERTION OF BREAST IMPLANTS YET AGAIN. IN 1992 I ALSO HAD TO HAVE THEM REMOVED DUE TO SYSTEMIC INFECTION. IN 1997, I CAME ACROSS THE PACKAGE INSERT AND PRODUCT DATA SHEET, CLEARLY STATING THAT MASTITIS OR ANY ACTIVE INFECTION IS CONTRAINDICATED TO THE USE OF BREAST IMPLANTS MADE FROM SILICONE GEL. I AM SO ILL WITH FIBRO-FATTY CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDER, ACCOMPANIED WITH SEVERE PAIN, PROMINENTLY MARKED VASCULARITY, FIBROMYALGIA, CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME, HYPOTHYROIDISM, PLANTAR FASCIITIS, ARTHRITIS IN KNEES, HANDS AND BACK. I EXPERIENCE NOW SEVERE PAIN IN HANDS, FINGERS, ARMS, THIGHS, BUTTOCKS CHEEKS, HIPS, AND CALVES OF BOTH LEGS.

280331|191820|D|1||"I HAD COMPLICATIONS IMMEDIATELY. I HAD TO HAVE 2 ADD'L SURGERIES TO CORRECT THE COMPLICATIONS. THEY HARDENED, MOVED IN MY CHEST CAVITY, AND THEY LEAKED. I STARTED TO ITCH IMMEDIATELY, AND BECAME ALLERGIC TO MANY THINGS. MY BODY FELT FATIGUED, I HAD MIGRAINE HEADACHES, AND COULDN'T SLEEP. I BEGAN TO ACHE ALL OVER, HAD PANIC ATTACKS, MY VISION CHANGED RAPIDLY. I KEPT REPORTING VARIOUS COMPLAINTS TO MY PHYSICIANS, NO ONE COULD HELP ME, EVEN THOUGH THEY KEPT TRYING. I BECAME DEPRESSED, MY WHOLE BODY BEGAN TO CHANGE, MY BREASTS WERE ITCHING DEEP INSIDE, WERE COMPLETELY NUMB. THEY WERE HOT TO TOUCH, AND PAINFUL, I WAS TOLD IT WOULD GO AWAY. THE SYMPTOMS PROGRESSED RAPIDLY, EACH TIME THEY WENT BACK IN, THEY USED THE SAME IMPLANTS, EVEN REFILLED THE ONE THAT LEAKED. MY MAMMOGRAMS SHOWED A BULGE, THE RADIOLOGIST ADVISED ME TO REMOVE THEM, THE PLASTIC SURGEON DENIED WHAT THE FILM SHOWED. I HAD A SONOGRAM LATER, AND IT SHOWED MY LYMPH NODES WERE SWOLLEN. THEY IDENTIFIED GEL OUTSIDE OF THE CAPSULES. MY HEALTH WAS DECLINING RAPIDLY. THE NURSES TOLD ME ABOUT THE ADVERSE EFFECTS, TWO MONTHS BEFORE THIS LITIGATION WAS TO CLOSE. I HAD TO SEE AN INTERNAL SPECIALIST, WHO DIAGNOSED ME WITH SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS, SO DID A RHEUMATOLOGIST, AND SO DID A NEUROLOGIST. I HAVE SEIZURES, CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDER, ATYPICAL LUPUS, SJOGREN'S, RAYNAUD'S, NUMEROUS OTHER CONDITIONS. I HAVE BEEN HOSPITALIZED, GONE TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM, STAYED HOME BECAUSE I AM NOW UNEMPLOYABLE. NO ONE WILL INSURE ME NOW, AND THIS IS A PARTIAL LIST OF MY SYMPTOMS, AND DISORDERS. I AM POSITIVE MY PATHOLOGIST'S REPORT SHOWED A HOLE IN MY IMPLANT. MY VISION IS VERY IMPAIRED NOW. I CAN'T GET OUT OF BED, WITHOUT HELP, AND I AM CONSTANTLY ILL. I AM IN HORRENDOUS PAIN EACH DAY. MY MEMORY IS IMPAIRED SIGNIFICANTLY. I GET LOST, I CAN'T EVEN SHOP FOR GROCERIES, OR COOK A MEAL NOW. I DON'T GO INTO A DEEP SLEEP PATTERN, MY BRAIN STAYS ON RUN, WHILE MY BODY CRIES IN PAIN. MY LEGS AND FEET STAY SWOLLEN HUGE. MY FINGERS DON'T MOVE, I HAVE CRAMPS IN MY HANDS, LEGS, AND FEET THAT MAKE MY HANDS DRAW INTO GNARLS. I HAVE NIGHT SWEATS, MY FACE IS GETTING A PINK RASH OVER MY NOSE. MY BRAIN HAS ELECTRIC LIGHT SHOWS, AND I WAKE UP EXHAUSTED. MY WHOLE LIFE HAS CHANGED. MY IMMUNE SYSTEM IS COMPROMISED, I CAN'T BE AROUND ANYONE WHO IS ILL, OR I GET ILL. I'M SO ALLERGIC TO ALL CHEMICALS, I HAVE SEVERE REACTIONS TO THEM. MY VOICE HAS CHANGED, MY SPEECH IS SLURRED, I'M NOT ME NOW. MY FACE HAS BROKEN OUT IN BLISTERS, I'M ALLERGIC TO THE SUN, AND I HAVE ASTHMA NOW. I CAN'T BEGIN TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAS HAPPENED. I HAVE SOMEONE TYPING FOR ME, MY BRAIN CAN'T PUT THE WORDS TOGETHER NOW. I HAD NONE OF THESE PROBLEMS BEFORE IMPLANTS. I WAS NEVER TOLD OF THE CHEMICALS IN IMPLANTS. I WAS TOLD THAT IT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER TO DETECT BREAST CANCER. I HAD FIBRO-CYSTIC BREAST DISEASE. I AM POSITIVE THE IMPLANTS ARE WHAT HAS CAUSED ME TO BECOME EXTREMELY DISABLED, I AM FORCED TO FILE FOR DISABILITY. I WOULD RATHER BE THE PRODUCTIVE PERSON I WAS BEFORE I HAD SILICONE IMPLANTS. I RARELY AM ABLE TO GO OUT. I CAN'T HOLD MY GRANDBABIES OR PARTICIPATE IN A NORMAL LIFE. I AM SEXUALLY NOT A LADY NOW. I CAN'T HAVE A CLIMAX, MY VAGINA IS SO DRY, AND PAINFUL. WHY DID THE FDA ALLOW THIS? I THOUGHT IMPLANTS WERE SAFE, AND HAD BEEN APPROVED. NOW I'M READING I'VE BEEN TOXICALLY POISONED. I TRY TO USE MY MIND TO CONTROL PAIN. I AM ILL, I WANT TO BE WELL, I WANT TO BE FREE FROM ALL OF THE THINGS I HAVE WRONG WITH ME NOW. I TRY SO HARD, BUT I CAN'T DO THINGS. I WILL NEVER GIVE UP TRYING. I WISH I WAS WELL ENOUGH TO BE ME AGAIN NOW. I STAY AWAY FROM THE DOCTORS, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY MORE. I CAN'T HEAR WELL, AND I'M SO TIRED. I DON'T LEAD A NORMAL LIFE. I'M SICK, AND I'M JUST TRYING TO HIDE FROM ANY MORE TESTS, OR HOSPS. THESE CHEST PAINS WERE NEVER NORMAL FOR A 35 YEAR OLD LADY WHO EXERCIZED, WAS PHYSICALLY IN SHAPE. NOW I CAN'T RAISE MY ARMS, THE PAIN GOES FROM MY BREAST CLEAR DOWN TO MY FINGERTIPS. I CAN'T TELL YOU ANY MORE, IT'S TOO UPSETTING TO LOOK AT. I HAD A HYSTERECTOMY, I HEMORRHAGED FOR MONTHS. I'VE HAD A KIDNEY STONE, MY BLADDER IS BLOCKED, INFECTED ALL THE TIME, AND THEY CAN'T DO SURGERY. I HAVE A YEAST INFECTION CONTINUALLY. MY NAILS HAVE HAD A FUNGUS. MY SKIN HAS HUGE BLOOD PLACES THE SIZE OF A MAN'S HAND, ON MY FOREARMS ALWAYS, MY SKIN IS LIKE TISSUE PAPER. I FREEZE WHEN IT IS 90 DEGREES. SINUS, OH I COULD JUST KEEP GOING ON, AND ON BUT I WON'T.

HE WANTS TO KNOW FDA'S POSITION ON THE DR'S ACTIONS SINCE IT IS HIS UNDERSTANDING THAT SPECIFIC DEVICES APPROVED FOR COMPASSIONATE USE ARE ASSIGNED TO SPECIFIC PTS. ALSO TO INFORM FDA THAT THIS DR IS CURRENTLY A PART OF THE SILAMED 1000CC COHESIVE IMPLANTS TRIALS. IN 1999, RPTR'S WIFE PARTICIPATED IN THE FDA TRIAL WHERE SHE WAS IMPLANTED WITH POLYPROPYLENE STRING BREAST IMPLANTS AT ~1200CC. BECAUSE THE IMPLANTS WERE NOT APPROVED AFTER THE TRIALS AND SINCE HE WAS RETIRING, DR OFFERED REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANTS FOR FREE, WHICH RPTR'S WIFE DID IN 2005. HE REPLACED THEM WITH 800CC SALINE IMPLANTS FROM INAMED WHICH HE OVERINFLATED TO 1200CC.

THE RIGHT BREAST HAS A LOT LESS FLUID LEFT IN IT. I HAD BEEN SICK FOR TEN YEARS WITH ALL KINDS OF ILLNESS INCLUDING JOIN PAIN , MEMORY LOSS, HEADACHES, DIZZY SPELLS, MIGRAINES, DRY EYES, PAIN IN HIPS, PAIN IN TAIL BONE, FIBROMYALGIA, CHRONIC FATIGUE, AUTOIMMUNE ILLNESS, IBS, SLEEP PROBLEMS, PAIN IN NECK AND SHOULDERS. HAVEN'T HAD PERIOD IN THREE MONTHS, INTOLERANCE TO ALCOHOL. I HAD THE IMPLANTS REMOVED IN 2005. THE LEFT CAPSULE WAS REMOVED, BUT NOT THE RIGHT, I HAD TO GO BACK TO A GENERAL SURGEON TO REMOVE RESIDUAL CAPSULE ON THE RIGHT.  THE SURGEON FOUND BLUE NODULES AND FREE FLOATING SILICONE. THIS BREAST HAS HAD THREE SURGERIES AND IS NOW A DIFFERENT SIZE. I AM STILL VERY SICK, I HAD SURGITEK BILUMEN.  I WAS TOLD THAT I WAS GETTING SALINE AND THAT THEY WOULD LAST A LIFETIME AND WERE COMPLETELY SALT WATER. I FOUND OUT AFTER THEY WERE REMOVED THAT THEY DID CONTAIN SILICONE, IT WAS FOUND IN MY BREAST TISSUE. I BREAST FED BOTH MY CHILDREN AND THEY BOTH HAD PROBLEMS. I HAVE BEEN SICK FOR TEN YEARS, MY DAUGHTER'S WHOLE LIFE. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS MAKING ME SO SICK. IT TOOK TEN YEARS AND OVER 50 DRS AND TESTS TO FINALLY FIGURE IT OUT ON MY OWN. I LOST MY JOB, MY HOME, MY HEALTH. I HAD NO INCOME. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO OR EVEN HOW TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELF, I DIDN'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT TO DO. I COULDN'T FUNCTION.

I WAS EXAMINED REGULARLY OVER THE 3 YEARS BECAUSE I WAS PART OF A SILICONE IMPLANT STUDY PRIOR TO THE FDA'S OFFICIAL APPROVAL OF SILICONE IMPLANTS FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC. RECENTLY, I DECIDED TO HAVE THEM REMOVED DUE TO SOME DISCOMFORT AND DISSATISFACTION WITH THE RESULTS OF THE SURGERY. I SAW A NUMBER OF SURGEONS TO DISCUSS REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANTS AND WAS EXAMINED BY A NUMBER OF DOCTORS, NONE OF WHICH MADE A RECOMMENDATION THAT I GET AN MRI. NONE OF THEM EVEN SUSPECTED A RUPTURE. I CHOSE A SURGEON WHO AGREED TO REMOVE THE IMPLANTS WITHOUT REPLACING THEM. I WAS TOLD IT WOULD BE A FAIRLY STRAIGHT FORWARD PROCEDURE. DURING SURGERY, HE DISCOVERED THAT ONE OF MY IMPLANTS HAD RUPTURED AND IT APPEARED AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN RUPTURED FOR A WHILE. DUE TO THE RUPTURE, THE SURGERY BECAME MORE COMPLICATED AS HE HAD TO SPEND A LOT MORE TIME CLEANING UP THE MESS CREATED BY THE RUPTURED SILICONE IMPLANT IN MY LEFT BREAST. IN THE PROCESS OF REMOVING THE SCATTERED SILICONE MORE BREAST TISSUE THAN ORIGINALLY EXPECTED WAS REMOVED DURING THE ""CLEAN UP"". FOLLOWING THE SURGERY I AM LEFT WITH A BREAST WHICH IS TAKING A LOT LONGER TO HEAL, I HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS WITH LEFT BREAST FOLLOWING THE SURGERY INCLUDING A LOT OF FLUID BUILD UP AND MULTIPLE DRAINS INSERTED TO HELP WITH THE FLUID DRAINAGE AND HEALING AND I'M STILL EXPERIENCING PAIN. I AM ALSO LEFT WITH UNEVEN BREASTS DUE TO THE COMPLICATION OF THE RUPTURED IMPLANT, AND THE ADD'L BREAST TISSUE REMOVED FROM THE BREAST WITH THE RUPTURED IMPLANT.

ACCORDING TO ALLERGAN, THEY RECOMMEND GETTING MRIS AFTER A CERTAIN NUMBER OF YEARS OR WHEN SUGGESTED BY A PHYSICIAN. I WAS EXAMINED MORE THAN MOST SILICONE IMPLANT PTS WOULD TYPICALLY BE, SINCE I WAS PART OF A STUDY WHICH REQUIRED CLOSE EXAMINATION AND REGULAR FOLLOW-UPS, AND I WAS NEVER TOLD TO GET AN MRI AND I WAS NEVER GIVEN ANY INDICATION THAT THE IMPLANT COULD HAVE RUPTURED EVEN WHEN I WAS EXPERIENCING SOME DISCOMFORT.

I DO NOT THINK THAT ALLERGAN HAS PUT THE APPROPRIATE MEASURES IN PLACE TO HELP PTS IDENTIFY RUPTURES EARLY ON TO AVOID LONG TERM PROBLEMS, SUCH AS PERMANENT DISFIGURATION AS I'VE EXPERIENCED. AND THEY CERTAINLY ARE NOT FOLLOWING APPROPRIATE BUSINESS PRACTICES TO RESOLVE ISSUES WHEN THEY OCCUR. IT IS COMPLETELY UNFAIR AND UNETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICE TO REFUSE TO PAY OUT THE SURGICAL COSTS OF THE IMPLANT REMOVAL BASED ON WHAT THEY SEE AS A ""LOOP HOLE"" WHEN THEIR WARRANTY SAYS THAT SURGICAL AND IMPLANT REPLACEMENT COSTS WILL BE PAID IF AN IMPLANT IS FAULTY. I DO NOT WANT THEM REPLACED AFTER THE TRAUMA I HAVE EXPERIENCED WITH THE FIRST IMPLANTS BUT I DO WANT THE SURGICAL COSTS FOR REMOVING THE IMPLANTS TO BE PAID FOR BY ALLERGAN AS THIS IS WHAT THEIR WARRANTY IS FOR.

INITIAL CLINICAL PRESENTATION (B)(6) 2010. THIS IS (B)(6) FEMALE WITH A HISTORY OF DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU OF THE LEFT BREAST DIAGNOSED IN 1998. SHE SUBSEQUENTLY UNDERWENT A LEFT MASTECTOMY WHERE THE SPECIMEN WEIGHT WAS 596 GRAMS. SHE UNDERWENT IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION WITH PLACEMENT OF SUBMUSCULAR TISSUE EXPANDER BY PLASTIC SURGEON #1. THE TISSUE EXPANDER WAS PLACED COMPLETELY SUBPECTORAL AND ALSO IN A SUBSERRATUS POCKET. THE EXPANDER WAS REMOVED IN 1999 AND REPLACED WITH A MCGHAN 440 ML DUAL-CHAMBER SILICONE AND SALINE-FILLED IMPLANT. SHE RECEIVED NO POSTOPERATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY OR RADIATION THERAPY. WITHIN A YEAR, SHE DEVELOPED SIGNIFICANT HARDENING AND DISTORTION OF THE LEFT RECONSTRUCTED BREAST WITH GRADUAL ELEVATION OF THE IMPLANT, TIGHTENING OF THE TISSUE AROUND THE IMPLANT, AND DISCOMFORT IN THE LEFT CHEST WALL. SHE WAS SEEN IN EVALUATION IN 2006 BY PLASTIC SURGEON #2, WHO RE-OPERATED ON HER LEFT BREAST AND REMOVED THE EXISTING IMPLANT, PERFORMED PERIPROSTHETIC CAPSULOTOMIES WHICH WERE NOT SPECIFIED IN THE OPERATIVE NOTE, SUBMITTED CAPSULAR TISSUE FOR HISTOLOGIC EXAMINATION (INTERPRETED AS NEGATIVE) AND REPLACED A SMALLER SALINE IMPLANT. THIS WAS AN ALLERGAN-STYLE 68MP SALINE IMPLANT, SIZE 390-420 ML. THIS RECONSTRUCTION WAS SOFT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, BUT WITHIN 1 YEAR, SHE HAD RECURRENCE OF THE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE WITH TIGHTENING OF THE TISSUE AROUND THE IMPLANT, GRADUAL ELEVATION OF THE IMPLANT LOCATION, AND DISCOMFORT IN THE LEFT CHEST WALL. SHE WAS SEEN IN EVALUATION IN 2009 BY PLASTIC SURGEON #4 WHO RECOMMENDED THAT SHE CONSIDER REVISION OF HER RECONSTRUCTION WITH THE ADDITION OF AN CELLULAR DERMAL MATRIX TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR RECURRENCE OF HER CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE AROUND THE DEVICE. PLASTIC SURGEON #4 ALSO RECOMMENDED AUTOLOGOUS ABDOMINAL FLAP RECONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES. THE PT WAS INTERESTED IN CONSIDERING A DIEP FLAP AND PLASTIC SURGEON #4 REFERRED HER TO ME ((B)(6) SURGEON #5) FOR EVALUATION AND CONSIDERATION OF A FREE FLAP BREAST RECONSTRUCTION PROCEDURE. THE PT'S PAST MEDICAL HISTORY WAS ADDITIONALLY SIGNIFICANT FOR A HISTORY OF HYPOTHYROIDISM AND BLADDER PROLAPSE. HER MEDICATIONS INCLUDED SYNTHROID 88 MCG DAILY, VITAMIN D, AND ADVIL. SHE IS A NONSMOKER AND DRINKS ALCOHOL RARELY. INITIAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION, (B)(6) 2010, SHOWED THE PT WAS 155 CM TALL, 70.3 KG. THE LEFT BREAST WAS ABSENT THROUGH A TRANSVERSE STEWART-TYPE MASTECTOMY INCISION. THERE WAS AN IMPLANT PRESENT IN THE SUBPECTORAL POSITION ON THE LEFT SIDE. THERE WAS A BAKER GRADE IV CAPSULE CONTRACTURE AROUND THIS DEVICE, WHICH WAS RIGIDLY AFFIXED TO HER CHEST WALL AND SOMEWHAT TENDER TO MANIPULATION. THE WOUNDS WERE WELL HEALED WITH NO EVIDENCE OF SCAR HYPERTROPHY. THE RIGHT BREAST WAS MORE PTOTIC WITH A DEGREE OF PSEUDOPTOSIS, LATERAL BOTTOMING OUT AND A WISE-PATTERN SCAR FROM PREVIOUS MASTOPEXY - RESULTING IN SUBSTANTIAL SHAPE AND VOLUME ASYMMETRY. ON THE LEFT SIDE, THE STERNAL NOTCH TO INFRAMAMMARY FOLD DISTANCE WAS 20 CM. ON THE RIGHT SIDE, THE STERNAL NOTCH TO INFRAMAMMARY FOLD DISTANCE WAS 23 CM. THE MID-CLAVICULAR POINT TO NIPPLE DISTANCE ON THE RIGHT WAS 21 CM. EXAMINATION OF THE ABDOMEN SHOWED A GENEROUS AMOUNT OF TISSUE IN THE LOWER 1/3 OF THE ABDOMEN FOR ABDOMINAL FLAP CONSIDERATION. INITIAL IMPRESSION, (B)(6) 2010. THIS WAS A (B)(6) FEMALE WITH RECURRENT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE FOLLOWING 2 PREVIOUS IMPLANT-BASED RECONSTRUCTION SURGERIES ON THE LEFT SIDE. THE LEFT BREAST RECONSTRUCTION SHOWED ELEVATION OF THE INFRAMAMMARY FOLD AND A SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE AROUND THE EXISTING IMPLANT. I RECOMMENDED REMOVAL OF THE EXISTING LEFT BREAST IMPLANT, RECONSTRUCTION OF THE ORIGINS OF THE LEFT PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE AND RECONSTRUCTION OF THE LEFT BREAST WITH A FREE ABDOMINAL FLAP. OPERATIVE FINDINGS ON (B)(6) 2011: THE LEFT BREAST IMPLANT CAPSULE WAS OPENED AND CONTAINED A CLOUDY YELLOW FLUID UNDER ENORMOUS PRESSURE, THE FLUID SQUIRTED OUT OF THE CAPSULAR INCISION AND TRAVELED AT LEAST 56 INCHES. THERE WAS A COLLECTION OF GELATINOUS MATERIAL WITHIN THE CAPSULE AS WELL AS AN INTACT SALINE BREAST IMPLANT. THE CAPSULE WAS THICKENED AND COVERED WITH PLAQUE-LIKE LESIONS INTERNALLY. A TOTAL CAPSULECTOMY WAS PERFORMED, THE PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE WAS REATTACHED TO ITS 5TH RIB ORIGINS. THE PERIPROSTHETIC FLUID WAS CAPTURED, AND ALL MATERIAL WAS SENT FOR PATHOLOGIC AND CYTOLOGIC EVALUATION INCLUDING FROZEN SECTION WHICH WAS CONSISTENT WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF ALCL. THE REMAINING RECONSTRUCTION WAS ABANDONED PENDING FINAL PATHOLOGY EVALUATION SPECIMEN. DETAILED PATHOLOGY FINDINGS: LEFT BREAST PERI-PROSTHETIC MATERIAL.

I FOLLOWED UP WITH MY PLASTIC SURGEON AT LEAST TWICE A WEEK. BREAST SURGERY WAS VERY PAINFUL. ON THIRD WEEK POST-SURGERY, I HAD SEVERAL MEDICAL COMPLAINTS: HEADACHE, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, NUMBNESS OF FACE, AND EVENTUALLY MOTTLING, REDNESS AND SWELLING OF LEFT BREAST, SWELLING ON PORT BELOW INTRA-MAMMARY FOLD. I HAD SEVERAL VISITS TO URGENT CARE, EMERGENCY HOSPITAL, AND DOCTORS' OFFICES. I DEVELOPED FEVER AND CELLULITIS ON BREAST; WHICH FELT LIKE A BALLOON. I WENT TO URGENT CARE ON (B)(6) 2012; WAS GIVEN VANCOMYCIN IV. THE NEXT DAY, I FELT THAT THE LEFT BREAST DEFLATED AND AREA AROUND PORT (INTRA-MAMMARY FOLD) FILLED WITH MORE FLUID.

RESULTS OF THE TEST IDENTIFIED AS M. FORTUITUM, SENSITIVE TO CLARITHROMYCIN, BUT RESISTANT TO DOXYCYCLINE.

MRI RESULTS: SOME ABNORMAL FINDINGS, BUT COULD NOT RULE OUT IF THIS IS DUE TO INFECTIOUS DISEASE OR POST-SURGICAL CHANGES. I SAW A SURGEON AT (B)(6). SHE CONCURRED WITH (B)(6) TREATMENT OF 6 MONTHS ANTIBIOTICS AND RETURN APPOINTMENT FOR REASSESSMENT IN 3 MONTHS. ANTIBIOTIC COMBINATION WERE PRESCRIBED, CHANGED FROM TIME TO TIME TO PREVENT BACTERIAL RESISTANCE AND SIDE EFFECTS.

WITHIN THE ARTICLE THE AUTHOR REPORTS ""IN (B)(4) 2010, A PREVIOUSLY HEALTHY (B)(6) WOMAN WITH TEXTURED SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS PLACED SUBPECTORALLY 8 YEARS AGO (FOR AESTHETIC PURPOSES), PRESENTED WITH 2-MONTH HISTORY OF A PAINLESS MASS UNDERNEATH HER LEFT ARM. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION SHOWED A SYMMETRICAL BREASTS WITH NO OVERLYING SKIN OR NIPPLE CHANGES. THERE WERE TWO LARGE MOBILE NODES PALPABLE IN THE LEFT AXILLA. INITIAL BREAST MAMMOGRAPHY AND ULTRASONOGRAPHY CONFIRMED LEFT AXILLARY LYMPHADENOPATHY BUT DID NOT SHOW ANY PERI-IMPLANT FLUID COLLECTION. BIOPSY OF THE LEFT AXILLARY MASS SHOWED FINDINGS CONSISTENT WITH CLASSIC HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA, NODULAR SCLEROSING TYPE. IT LACKED TWO TYPICAL STAINS-CD15 AND PAX5. PET-CT SHOWED A 5-CM AREA OF PET-AVID LEFT AXILLARY LYMPHADENOPATHY. HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA STAGE IA WAS DIAGNOSED. THE PT THEN HAD TWO CYCLES OF ADRIAMYCIN, BLEOMYCIN, VINBLASTINE, AND DACARBAZINE (ABVD) AND 2000 GY OF FIELD RADIATION TO THE LEFT AXILLA. HER INITIAL TREATMENT WAS COMPLETED IN (B)(6) 2011. F/U CT SCAN IN (B)(6) 2011, SHOWED A DECREASE IN THE SIZE OF THE LEFT AXILLARY LYMPHADENOPATHY. UNILATERAL FLUID COLLECTION, HOWEVER, WAS NOTED AROUND THE LEFT BREAST IMPLANT (FIGURE). THE FLUID INCREASED IN SIZE AND SHE PRESENTED 6 MONTHS ALTER WITH LEAKAGE OF SEROUS FLUID FROM HER LEFT BREAST. CYTOLOGY OF THE PERI-IMPLANT FLUID SHOWED CD30+ LYMPHOMA CELLS OF INDETERMINATE LINEAGE. DIFFERENT DIAGNOSIS INCLUDED RECURRENT HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA OR IMPLANT-ASSOCIATED ANAPLASTIC LARGE-CELL LYMPHOMA. REPEAT PET-CT SHOWED PET-AVID AREAS ON BILATERAL AXILLARY LYMPH NODES. BOTH IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED WITH CAPSULECTOMIES. IN (B)(6) 2011, SHE REPEAT PET-CT SHOWED PET-AVID AREAS IN BILATERAL AXILLARY LYMPH NODES. BOTH IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED WITH CAPSULECTOMIES. IN (B)(6) 2011, SHE WAS TREATED WITH FOUR CYCLES OF SALVAGE CHEMOTHERAPY WITH GEMCITABINE AND CISPLATIN FOR ASSUMED RECURRENT HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA. F/U SONOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT BREAST 1 MONTH LATER SHOWED A HYPOECHOIC MASS. BIOPSY OF THE MASS SHOWED SIMILAR CELLS FROM THE PERI-IMPLANT FLUID, WHICH WERE CD30+ LYMPHOMA CELLS OF INDETERMINATE ORIGIN. THE MASS WAS RESECTED IN (B)(6) 2012, AND PATHOLOGICAL TESTS SHOWED (B)(6), SEROMA-ASSOCIATED (LARGE-CELL LYMPHOMA (ALK-NEGATIVE ALCL). A RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW OF ALL SIDES SHOWED LARGE CELLS CHARACTERISTIC OF ALK-NEGATIVE ALCL. SUBSTANTIAL OVERLAP IN MORPHOLOGY AND IMMUNOPHENOTYPE OF CELLS FROM THE INITIAL AXILLARY LYMPH NODE BIOPSY, THE PERI-IMPLANT FLUID AND THE FINAL LEFT BREAST MASS BIOPSY SUGGESTED THE SAME MANIFESTATIONS OF THE ALCL. THE PRESENTATION IS UNIQUE BECAUSE ALK-NEGATIVE ALCL PRESENTED WITH A PATHOLOGICAL AXILLARY LYMPH NODE INSTEAD OF THE TYPICAL PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. OUR PT COMPLETED BRENTUXIMAB THERAPY FOR TREATMENT OF ALK-NEGATIVE ALCL. THE PT WAS LAST SEEN ON (B)(6) 2012 AND IS IN STABLE CONDITION."|UNK SALINE IMPLANT|UNK SALINE IMPLANT|11/15/2012|||DA|N|R||0HP|FWM|1.0||nan||NI|||GOLETA|US|ALLERGAN||CA|||||True

ALLERGAN LABELING ADDRESSES THE EVENT OF BREAST LUMPS AS FOLLOWS: BREAST SELF-EXAMINATIONS: FOLLOWING BREAST AUGMENTATION, YOU SHOULD CONTINUE TO PERFORM BREAST SELF-EXAMINATION MONTHLY. THIS MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT WITH A BREAST IMPLANT IN PLACE. TO CONTINUE TO PERFORM A MONTHLY BREAST SELF EXAMINATION EFFICIENTLY, YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR SURGEON TO HELP YOU IDENTIFY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLANT AND YOUR BREAST TISSUE. BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE IMPLANT FROM BREAST TISSUE WILL DECREASE THE NECESSITY OF EXCESSIVE SQUEEZING OF THE IMPLANT DURING EXAMINATION. ANY NEW LUMPS SHOULD BE EVALUATED WITH A BIOPSY, AS APPROPRIATE. IF A BIOPSY IS PERFORMED, BE SURE TO INFORM THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL PERFORMING THE BIOPSY THAT YOU HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS SO THAT CARE WILL BE TAKEN TO AVOID INJURING THE IMPLANT. THE 410 DEVICE LABELING ADDRESSES ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL): BASED ON INFO REPORTED TO FDA AND FOUND IN MEDICAL LITERATURE, A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BETWEEN BREAST IMPLANTS AND THE RARE DEVELOPMENT OF ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA (ALCL), A TYPE OF NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA. WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGAN'S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERS' BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL.

I MET WITH A PLASTIC SURGEON ABOUT MY OPTIONS AND HE SUGGESTED SILICONE IMPLANTS DUE TO THEIR SOFTNESS AND ABILITY TO FEEL MORE NATURAL THAN A SALINE IMPLANT. IN (B)(6) 2012 I BEGAN TO HAVE MEDICAL PROBLEMS. IT STARTED WITH THORACIC BACK PAIN THAT WAS INTENSE AND SEVERE. IT THEN RADIATED TO MY NECK, SHOULDERS AND CHEST AREA. I HAD NUMEROUS TESTS RUN ON ME AND NOTHING PROVED TO BE THE CAUSE FOR THE PAIN I WAS FEELING. I HAD MRIS, X-RAYS, BLOOD WORK, HAD EXTENSIVE PHYSICAL THERAPY, DEEP TISSUE MASSAGE AND ACUPRESSURE FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS. I HAD INJECTIONS AND VARIOUS MEDICATIONS GIVEN TO ME TO TRY AND HELP WITH THE PAIN. IT DID NOT HELP AND I CONTINUED TO WORE. I FELT LIKE SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH MY IMPLANTS AND PERHAPS THIS WAS THE CAUSE SINCE THIS CAME ON FROM NOWHERE AND HAD ALWAYS BEEN HEALTHY AND QUITE ACTIVE. THE SURGEON WHO PLACED THEM INSIDE ME BARELY EXAMINED ME AND TOLD ME IN (B)(6) 2012 THAT IT WAS NOT FROM MY IMPLANTS AND TO SEARCH ELSEWHERE. HE DID NOT REQUEST AN MRI OF MY IMPLANTS OR ANY ADDITIONAL TESTING. AT THIS POINT I AM BECOMING MORE AND MORE FATIGUED, I AM FEELING HARDNESS IN MY LYMPH NODES IN MY BREAST AREA, AND NECK AREA. I CAN BARELY MOVE AND HAVE NO ENERGY. I AM NO MISSING A LOT OF WORK DUE TO MY SUDDEN AND PROBLEMATIC HEALTH ISSUES. I CONTINUED TO SEARCH FOR THE CAUSE. I WENT TO (B)(6) BASED ON THIS DOCTOR TELLING ME TO LOOK ELSEWHERE. AFTER A YEAR OF THIS CONTINUED PAIN AND SWELLING AND NUMEROUS DOCTOR BILLS I WENT TO ANOTHER PLASTIC SURGEON FOR HIS OPINION. HE IMMEDIATELY TOLD ME THAT MY BREASTS WERE TOO LARGE AND THAT THEY DIDN'T LOOK RIGHT. HE SAID I SHOULD HAVE THEM REMOVED TO HELP ME IMPROVE MY HEALTH. I HAD THESE IMPLANTS REMOVED ON (B)(6) 2013 AND AFTERWARDS THE SURGEON TOLD ME THAT THE IMPLANTS HAD COMPLETELY RUPTURED AND THAT THE IMPLANTS HAD LEAKED THE SILICONE EVERYWHERE. HE SAID IT WAS ONE OF THE WORSE CASES HE HAD SEEN. MY RECOVERY HAS BEEN HORRIBLE. MY LYMPH NODES ARE TOTALLY SWOLLEN AND IT IS OBVIOUS AND VERY VISIBLE. MY BACK PAIN FROM THE TRAUMA OF THE REMOVAL OF THE LEAKED SILICONE HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE. I HAVE HAD A MAJOR WEIGHT GAIN WHICH APPEARS TO BE FROM FLUID RETENTION AND MY LYMPHATIC SYSTEM APPEARS TO NOT BE WORKING PROPERLY. I NOW HAVE TO MEET WITH AN AUTOIMMUNE SPECIALIST TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING ON SINCE NO OTHER DIAGNOSIS HAS BEEN DETERMINED. I HAVE NOW LOST MY JOB DUE TO MY FAILING HEALTH AND TRULY FEEL IT IS BECAUSE OF THE RUPTURED SILICONE THAT HAD BEEN LEAKED INTO MY BODY EVERYWHERE. I HAD BEEN DISMISSED BY THE ORIGINAL SURGEON WHEN CLEARLY HE SHOULD HAVE REQUESTED AN MRI WHICH WOULD HAVE SHOWN THE RUPTURED IMPLANTS. INSTEAD I WENT ANOTHER YEAR IN MAJOR PAIN WHEN MY IMPLANTS HAD LEAKED. MY NORMAL PHYSICIAN ALSO BELIEVES THERE IS AN AUTOIMMUNE ISSUE GOING ON WITH ME DUE TO THE IMPLANTS. MY LIFE HAS BEEN DRASTICALLY AFFECTED IN MANY WAYS. IT HAS DESTROYED MY HEALTH, CAREER, PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS AND HAS FINANCIALLY DEVASTATED ME. I AM DISGUSTED THAT THE ORIGINAL SURGEON DID NOT STEP UP TO HELP DIAGNOSE THE POSSIBILITY THAT MY IMPLANTS HAD RUPTURED AND WAS CAUSING ME TO BE SICK. AT THE VERY LEAST HE SHOULD HAVE REQUESTED OR SUGGESTED THAT IN (B)(6) 2012. MY BREASTS LOOKED DEFORMED AND WERE TOO BIG AND THIS WAS VERIFIED BY MY OTHER SURGEON. I AM WANTING THIS TO BE DOCUMENTED TO TRY AND HELP OTHERS. (B)(6) NEVER RETURNED ANY OF MY EMAILS OR CALLS IN REGARDS TO THIS. THEY ONLY KEPT IN CONTACT WITH ME FOR THEIR STUDY THE FIRST YEAR AFTER HAVING THEIR IMPLANTS PLACED IN ME.

A LARGE, LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP FOUND NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE RISK RATES FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CANCERS, INCLUDING STOMACH CANCER, LEUKEMIA, AND LYMPHOMA. IN THE (B)(4) STUDY, AT LEAST 1 REOPERATION WAS PERFORMED ON 315 PTS (36.5%) THROUGH 10 YEARS. A TOTAL OF 424 REOPERATIONS WERE PERFORMED. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR REOPERATION THROUGH 10 YEARS ON AUGMENTATION PATIENTS WAS IMPLANT DEFLATION AT 21.7%. THE PERCENTAGE OF REOPERATIONS DUE TO LUMP/MASS/CYST INCREASED FROM 8.5% OF 293 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 5 YEARS TO 13.9% OF 424 REOPERATIONS THROUGH 10 YEARS. THE OCCURRENCE OF LUMPS, MASSES, AND CYSTS CAN BE EXPECTED TO NATURALLY INCREASE AS PTS AGE AND COULD BE AN EXPLANATION FOR THE INCREASE. IN RARE INSTANCES, ACUTE INFECTION MAY OCCUR IN A BREAST WITH IMPLANTS. THE SIGNS OF ACUTE INFECTION INCLUDE ERYTHEMA, TENDERNESS, FLUID ACCUMULATION, PAIN, AND FEVER. VERY RARELY, TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME, A POTENTIALLY LIFE-THREATENING CONDITION, HAS BEEN REPORTED IN WOMEN AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY. IT IS CHARACTERIZED BY SYMPTOMS THAT OCCUR SUDDENLY AND INCLUDE HIGH FEVER (102 DEGREE F, 38.8 DEGREE C OR HIGHER), VOMITING, DIARRHEA, A SUNBURN-LIKE RASH, RED EYES, DIZZINESS, LIGHTHEADEDNESS, MUSCLE ACHES, AND DROPS IN BLOOD PRESSURE, WHICH MAY CAUSE FAINTING. PTS SHOULD BE ADVISED TO CONTACT A PHYSICIAN IMMEDIATELY FOR DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT FOR ANY OF THESE SYSTEMS.

5039249|24514426|D|1||"I HAD BREAST AUGMENTATION IN 2007. MY IMPLANTS ARE THE GUMMY BEAR, SILICONE, UNDER THE MUSCLE. I REALLY HADN'T BEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO ANY CERTAIN SYMPTOM UNTIL IN EARLY (B)(6) 2014, I WAS EXERCISING AND NOTICED A SEVERE PAIN IN MY RIGHT CALF MUSCLE. I THOUGHT I HAD TORN MY CALF BUT AFTER A WEEK IT WENT AWAY. AS I CONTINUED TO EXERCISE I NOTICED EXTREME FATIGUE IN MY MUSCLES AND REALIZED THAT I COULD NOT LIFT MY RIGHT FOOT. SEARCHING THE INTERNET I REALIZED I HAD FOOT DROP. AT THE SAME TIME I HAD STARTED NOTICING MY MUSCLES TWITCHING. I AM AN INTERNET RESEARCHER AND WHAT I WAS FINDING WAS INCREDIBLY SCARY. IN ADDITION, MY RIGHT BREAST HAD AN EPISODE OF SWELLING AND PAIN. I SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT FOR THE BREAST. THEY DID ULTRASOUND, MAMMO, AND THEN MRI. FINDING FLUID UNDER THE IMPLANT THEY SCHEDULED A BIOPSY AND MENTIONED ALCL. DURING THE APPOINTMENT FOR THE BIOPSY THE DOC COULD NOT FIND ENOUGH FLUID TO BIOPSY AND BECAUSE THE PAIN WAS GONE HE ABORTED THE PROCEDURE. FAST FORWARD TO (B)(6) 2014, I SAW A GP FOR THE MUSCLE CRAMPS AND FOOT DROP, SHE REFERRED ME TO A NEUROLOGIST. I ASKED ALL DOCTORS IF MY IMPLANTS COULD BE (THE RADIOLOGIST FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF RUPTURE) RELATED AT ALL - ALL SAID ""OH, BUT I'M NO EXPERT."" NEUROLOGIST #1 DID A COUPLE OF TESTS OF MY BLOOD (FOR COPPER) AND AN EMG. SAID I DEFINITELY HAD WEAKNESS AND UNEXPLAINED FOOT DROP SO I ""PROBABLY HAVE ALS"", SO MY WORLD HAS COME CRASHING DOWN. WE GOT A SECOND OPINION FROM A NEUROLOGIST THAT SPECIALIZES IN ALS. UPON FIRST MEETING HE SAID IT COULD BE SO MANY THINGS. ORDERED ANOTHER EMG. THAT DOC SAID THE TEST RESULTS DID NOT SEEM CONSISTENT WITH ALS BUT BECAUSE THERE IS NO TEST FOR ALS IT WOULD BE A WAIT AND SEE SITUATION. ABOUT (B)(6) IN BLOOD TESTS LATER FOR ANY ALS MARKERS OR ANYTHING ELSE, NO CONCLUSION. ANOTHER EMG WAS DONE AT THE ""SPECIALIST'S OFFICE"" AND ONE TECH SAID SOME PARTS OF ME TESTED BETTER THAN LAST TIME AND THEN SOME AREAS LOOKED THE SAME OR ""MAYBE SLIGHTLY WORSE."" AT THIS POINT I HAD STOPPED FOCUSING ON MY BREAST BUT THE RIGHT SIDE STILL DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT. IT IS SLIGHTLY MORE RIGID. I CAN FEEL RIPPLES IN THE IMPLANT, MY NECK APPEARS SLIGHTLY SWOLLEN ON THE RIGHT. SEARCHING BACK THE LAST 8 YEARS I STARTED REALIZING THAT MY MUSCLE WEAKNESSES PROBABLY BEGAN 3-4 YEARS AGO, THE CRAMPS AT LEAST 3-4 YEARS. I'VE STRUGGLED WITH MILD FACIAL BREAK OUTS, SMELLING URINE, MORE EXTREME SYMPTOMS DURING CERTAIN DAYS OF THE MONTH, TONGUE SWELLING, ANXIETY, FATIGUE, ETC. NOT WILLING TO SIT AROUND AND DO NOTHING I AM SEEING A NATUROPATH. HE SAYS MY LYME TEST CAME BACK WITH A 50/50 CHANCE OF ME HAVING LYME. MY B12 IS LOW, MY TESTOSTERONE LEVELS ARE BARELY EXISTENT, AND ONE OTHER MICRONUTRIENT WAS LOW. I'VE SHARED ALL THIS WITH MY NEUROLOGIST AND HE SAYS THAT NONE OF THIS MEANS ANYTHING. I AM GETTING SLIGHTLY WEAKER. I WALK WITH A LIMP DUE TO THE FOOT DROP, JOINT PAIN AND BACK PAIN COME AND GO. FOOT DROP AND MUSCLE TWITCHES REMAIN. MY GUT SAYS ITS THE IMPLANTS AND I KNOW THERE IS NO TEST TO DO FOR A DEFINITIVE ANSWER. ON (B)(6) 2015 I WENT IN FOR EXPLANT. IT WAS FOUND THAT MY RIGHT IMPLANT WAS RUPTURED AND THE SILICONE HAD SPILLED OUT INTO MY TISSUES. THE DOCTOR PERFORMED AN EN BLOC CAPSULECTOMY AND REPLACED THE IMPLANTS WITH MENTOR SALINE IMPLANTS. I AM 1.5 POST EXPLANT AND I NOTICE SOME MILD CHANGES, IMPROVEMENTS. HOWEVER, MUSCLE TWITCHES AND FOOT DROP REMAIN. I HAVE FOUND A (B)(6) GROUP WITH OVER 300 WOMEN THAT ARE EXTREMELY ILL FROM THEIR IMPLANTS AND TRYING TO GET HELP AND GET HEALTHY. I BELIEVE THAT I HAVE SOME SOFT OF SILICONE POISONING THAT IS NOT DETECTED BY MEDICAL TESTS. I AM IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO DO SMALL THINGS TO DETOX, EAT HEALTHY, INFRARED SAUNA, ETC.

USE CARE IN SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURES SUCH AS OPEN CAPSULOTOMY, BREAST POCKET REVISION, HEMATOMA/SEROMA ASPIRATION, AND BIOPSY/LUMPECTOMY TO AVOID DAMAGE TO THE IMPLANT SHELL OR VALVE. ANY POSTOPERATIVE EVACUATION OF HEMATOMA OR SEROMA MUST BE CONDUCTED WITH CARE TO AVOID BREAST IMPLANT CONTAMINATION, OR DAMAGE FROM SHARP INSTRUMENTS. THE USE OF MICROWAVE DIATHERMY IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST IMPLANTS IS NOT RECOMMENDED, AS IT HAS BEEN REPORTED TO CAUSE TISSUE NECROSIS, SKIN EROSION, AND EXTRUSION OF THE IMPLANT. ALLERGAN HAS NOT TESTED THE IN VIVO EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT RADIATION THERAPY MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, NECROSIS, AND IMPLANT EXTRUSION. PATIENTS SHOULD BE INFORMED THAT DISSATISFACTION WITH COSMETIC RESULTS RELATED TO SUCH THINGS AS SCAR DEFORMITY, HYPERTROPHIC SCARRING, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, ASYMMETRY, WRINKLING, IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT/MIGRATION, INCORRECT SIZE, AND IMPLANT PALPABILITY/VISIBILITY MAY OCCUR. CAREFUL SURGICAL PLANNING AND TECHNIQUE CAN MINIMIZE, BUT NOT PRECLUDE, THE RISK OF SUCH RESULTS. PRE-EXISTING ASYMMETRY MAY NOT BE ENTIRELY CORRECTABLE.

THE IMPLANTS WERE MADE BY SIENTRA. AT 2 WEEKS AFTER SURGERY GOT VERY ILL, DIZZINESS, FEVER, CHILLS, EXTREME FATIGUES, LOSS OF APPETITE, AND PAIN ON MY LEFT SIDE. IT WENT UNDIAGNOSED FOR ANOTHER WEEK, THEY THOUGHT I HAD CONTRACTED THE FLU. THE PLASTIC SURGEON REFERRED ME TO AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE DR. EXACTLY ONE MONTH AFTER SURGERY, I STARTED IV ANTIBIOTICS UNDER CARE OF. BEGUN A 4 WEEK ROUND OF VANCOMYCIN AND AZITHROMYCIN. INFECTION LEVELS DROPPED SOME, STILL VERY ILL AND SKIN ON BREAST WAS REDDER, MORE HARD, AND VERY PAINFUL. AT WEEK 8, NOTICED SOME DISCHARGE FROM NIPPLE WHERE THE STITCHES HAD BEEN. I WENT TO PLASTIC SURGEON, HE MADE A SMALL HOLE, FLUID CAME GUSHING OUT. HE SAID THE IMPLANT WAS ON TOP AND WAS VISIBLE, RATHER THAN UNDER THE MUSCLE; IT WAS PUSHING ITS' WAY OUT. SCHEDULED THE SURGERY OF EXPLANT OF THE LEFT SIDE IN WHICH I HAD THE INFECTION. MY RIGHT BREST APPEARED FINE, NO PAIN OR REDNESS, STITCHES NORMAL ON THE RIGHT SIDE. IN DOING A CULTURE OF THE TISSUE, IT WAS DETERMINED THE INFECTION WAS CAUSED BY MYCOBACTERIUM FORTUITUM. WHEN THE INFECTIOUS DISEASE DR. INFORMED ME OF WHAT THIS WAS, HE SAID IT WAS VERY RARE IN THE US. HE HAD ONLY SEEN THIS INFECTION ONCE BEFORE, 10 YRS. PRIOR ON A BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY ON SOMEONE WHO HAD BEEN IN THE MARINES. I THEN STARTED THE ANTIBIOTIC CLARITHROMYCIN FOR ANOTHER 4 WEEKS. THE DR. HAS FELT THAT A PROTOCOL SOMEWHERE WAS MISSED AND BELIEVED WAS ON THE IMPLANT TO START.

5761253|48540699|D|1||I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER IN MY RIGHT BREAST IN (B)(6) 2010. I CONTACTED A BREAST CANCER SURGEON AND SHE TOLD ME I NEEDED TO HAVE A MASTECTOMY SINCE THERE WERE 2 TUMORS IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF MY BREAST. I ALSO CONTACTED A RECONSTRUCTIVE/PLASTIC SURGEON. I AGREED TO HAVE AN IMPLANT PUT IN AT THE SAME TIME AS MY SURGERY. THE PLASTIC SURGEON PUT IN A TISSUE EXPANDER FOR THREE MONTHS AND ON (B)(6) 2011, I HAD AN ALLERGAN TEXTURED BREAST IMPLANT PUT IN. THE STYLE OF THE IMPLANT HAD NOT BEEN APPROVED BY THE FDA YET, SO I SIGNED A CONSENT FORM TO BE PART OF A STUDY. I READ THE AGREEMENT THOROUGHLY AND THERE WERE ONLY TWO POSSIBLE RISKS: INFECTION OR COMPARTMENT CONTRACTURE. THERE WAS NO MENTION OF LYMPHOMA CANCER. APPROXIMATELY 2 YEARS LATER THE FDA APPROVED THIS STYLE IMPLANT AND THE STUDY WAS ENDED. ON (B)(6) 2016 MY RIGHT BREAST BECAME TIGHT AND HARD. IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS IT BECAME LARGER AND LARGER. I CONTACTED MY PLASTIC SURGEON AND SHE ASKED ME TO TAKE A PICTURE OF MY BREAST AND SEND TO HER, SINCE I WAS OUT OF TOWN AT THE TIME. SHE ORDERED AN ANTIBIOTIC AND MADE AN APPOINTMENT FOR ME TO SEE HER THE FOLLOWING WEEK. I WENT TO SEE HER AND SHE TOOK MORE PICTURES AND TOLD ME IT WAS PROBABLY AN INFECTION AND I SHOULD CONTINUE ANTIBIOTIC. MY BREAST GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER AND MY SURGEON DECIDED TO REMOVE MY IMPLANT. DURING THE SURGERY SHE TOOK A TISSUE SAMPLE AND THEN PUT IN A NEW TEXTURED IMPLANT AND CLOSED UP INCISION. ON (B)(6), THE PATHOLOGY REPORT CAME BACK WITH THE DIAGNOSIS OF ALCL. IT WAS CONFIRMED BY A PET CT SCAN. MY SURGEON SAID THAT SHE KNEW THE DOCTOR WHO SPECIALIZED IN ALCL AND THAT HE WAS AT THE (B)(6). MY HUSBAND AND I FLEW TO (B)(6) TO HAVE IMPLANT AND SURROUNDING SCAR TISSUE REMOVED BY THE SURGEONS WHO ARE THE AUTHORITY ON THIS DISEASE. ALSO, THE RESEARCH ON THIS DISEASE IS BEING DONE BY A TEAM THERE. THEY HAVE SEEN MOST OF THE DIAGNOSED CASES IN THE US. I HAD OTHER TESTS DONE THERE: AN ULTRASOUND AND A CHEST X-RAY. I SPOKE WITH THE DOCTOR AND HE TOLD ME THAT THE LYMPHOMA WAS ONLY IN THE FLUID SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT AND NOT IN THE SCAR TISSUE (CAPSULE) OR IN MY LYMPH NODES. I HAD THE SURGERY ON (B)(6) 2016 AND WAS INFORMED THAT ALL OF THE CANCER CELLS WERE REMOVED AND I WAS NOW CANCER FREE. I DECIDED TO HAVE A SMOOTH SILICONE IMPLANT PUT IN DURING THE SURGERY RATHER THAN COME BACK LATER FOR ADDITIONAL RECONSTRUCTION. THE DOCTOR TOLD ME THAT NONE OF THE ALCL CASES HAD EVER INVOLVED A SMOOTH IMPLANT. I ALSO AGREED TO HAVE A PET CT SCAN EVERY 6 MONTHS TO BE SURE THERE WERE NO NEW CANCER CELLS.|NATRELLE TEXTURED BREAST IMPLANT||06/27/2016||||N|*||I|FTR|1.0||BREAST IMPLANT|||||||ALLERGAN|||||||True

I'M WRITING TO REPORT AN ADVERSE EVENT (MANY ACTUALLY) RELATED TO HAVING HAD DOW CORNING SILASTIC II BREAST IMPLANTS. I HAD THEM FOR 22 YEARS. I HAD UNDIAGNOSED RUPTURE FOR 16 YEARS BECAUSE DOCTORS FAILED TO CONNECT MY SYMPTOMS TO MY IMPLANTS. DOCTORS THAT DON'T BELIEVE BREAST IMPLANTS MAKE WOMEN ILL IMPEDE A TIMELY DIAGNOSIS. I WAS NEVER SENT FOR THE RIGHT DIAGNOSTIC TESTS WHEN I PRESENTED WITH SYMPTOMS THAT WERE TEXTBOOK FOR RUPTURE. IT WASN'T UNTIL I CAME TO BE UNDER THE CARE OF A YOUNG RESIDENT DOCTOR WHO WAS ASSIGNED MY CASE BECAUSE ALL OF THE LOCAL DOCTORS HAD DETERMINED MY SYMPTOMS WERE PSYCHOSOMATIC. THIS RESIDENT DOCTOR LOOKED ME IN THE EYES AND ASKED IF I REALLY BELIEVED THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG. I REPLIED, YES, I KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG, BUT NOBODY WILL FIND IT BECAUSE NOBODY IS BOTHERING TO LOOK. I SHOWED HIM, USING MY HANDS, WHERE I COULD FEEL SOMETHING INSIDE ME. HE ORDERED AN ULTRASOUND WHICH DIAGNOSED RUPTURE. FROM THERE I REQUESTED AN MRI, BUT WAS DENIED BY A LOCAL SURGEON. THE ONE THAT HADN'T BOTHERED TO PROPERLY INVESTIGATE MY SYMPTOMS. I PERSISTED, AND HE FINALLY SAID HE WOULD ONLY ORDER MRI IF THE RADIOLOGIST THOUGHT IT APPROPRIATE. THE MRI PROVED TO BE AN EXACT MAP OF WHERE I'D SHOWN THE RESIDENT DOCTOR WHERE I COULD FEEL SOMETHING INSIDE MY CHEST WALL. BECAUSE OF THE LONG STANDING NATURE OF RUPTURE, SILICONE HAD MIGRATED DEEPLY INTO MY CHEST WALL. I WAS EXPLANTED (B)(6) 2013. I WAS ON DEATH'S DOORSTEP. MY EXPLANT SURGEON TOLD ME MY PROGNOSIS IS POOR. DESPITE HAVING EXPLANT SURGERY I STILL HAVE SILICONE IN ME AND IT CONTINUES TO MIGRATE. I HAVE HAD MULTIPLE ULTRASOUNDS OF MY LEFT BREAST. I HAVE SILICONE OUTSIDE OF THE AREAS OF FOCUS. I CAN FEEL IT (AS I COULD PRIOR TO EXPLANT) AND I AM NOTICING NEW LYMPH NODE INVOLVEMENT OUTSIDE OF THE REGION OF MY BREASTS. FOR ABOUT 2 YEARS POST EXPLANT I HAD IMPROVEMENT IN MANY SYMPTOMS BUT, AFTER 6 MONTHS AGO SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS STARTED TO RETURN AND COINCIDED WITH FEELING INCREASED PAIN AND LOCALIZED SYMPTOMS IN MY LEFT BREAST. YOU SHOULD BE VERY INTERESTED TO KNOW THAT THE LOCAL SURGEON THAT FAILED TO DIAGNOSE MY RUPTURE TOLD ME THAT MOVING FORWARD HE WILL NOT PROACTIVELY SEND WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS THAT ARE PRESENTING TO HIM WITH SYMPTOMS CONSISTENT WITH RUPTURE FOR AN ULTRASOUND OR MRI BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO BECOME INVOLVED. MY STORY DURING IMPLANT THE SURGEON RIPPED AN ENTIRE BUNDLE OF NERVES IN MY LEFT BREAST SO I WAS IN A LOT OF PAIN FROM THE START! THE NERVES TOOK ABOUT SIX YEARS TO HEAL AND THE PAIN FINALLY SUBSIDED, BUT THAT WAS ALSO THE TIME THAT MY IMPLANTS HAD UNKNOWINGLY RUPTURED. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING IMPLANT I ALSO NOTED THAT MY BREASTS WERE REALLY, REALLY COLD. AND, THE WORST THING, WHICH BROKE MY HEART, WAS WHEN I RETURNED HOME I REALIZED THAT FROM THAT POINT I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO FEEL MY CHILDREN AGAINST MY HEART AND THEIR EXPERIENCE OF HUGGING ME WOULD...|SILASTIC II, ROUND, LOW PROFILE SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLANT|PO14-0260|08/31/2016||||N|*||I|FTR|1.0||SILASTIC II, ROUND, LOW PROFILE SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLANT||HH119236|||||DOW CORNING WRIGHT/MENTOR|||||||True

THE TWO ADDITIONAL RENTS BOTH MEASURED APPROXIMATELY < .1CM IN THE SHELL OF THE DEVICE. AREAS OF SHELL WEAR WERE ALSO OBSERVED IN THE SHELL. ALTHOUGH THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE RENTS COULD NOT BE DETERMINED, SHELL WEAR SUGGEST IN-VIVO FOLDING OR CREASING OF THE DEVICE. NO OTHER ANOMALIES WERE OBSERVED. BREAST IMPLANTS ARE NOT LIFETIME DEVICES.

BUT I AM OPTIMISTIC THAT REMOVING THE IMPLANTS WERE MY LAST HOPE AND GETTING MY BODY HEALTHY AGAIN. I TRULY BELIEVE THAT MY IMPLANTS CAUSED MY ILLNESS AND THAT OTHER WOMEN HEAR MY STORY.|SILICONE IMPLANTS||09/02/2016||||N|*||I|FTR|1.0||SILICONE IMPLANTS||5954855|||||MENTOR|||||||True

BREAST AUGMENTATION WAS DONE 11 YEARS PREVIOUSLY WITH SUBGLANDULAR PLACEMENT OF ALLERGAN TEXTURIZED PROSTHESES THROUGH THE INFRAMAMMARY APPROACH. THE BREAST AUGMENTATION WAS DONE ELSEWHERE. DESPITE OUR EFFORTS TO GET INFO ABOUT THE IMPLANT FROM THE PLASTIC SURGEON THAT HAD IMPLANTED THE DEVICE, WE HAVE NO SERIAL NUMBER OR PRODUCT CODE. THE PT HAD NO FURTHER INFO. AN ULTRASOUND AND MAMMOGRAPHY IMAGES WHICH WERE DONE 4 MONTHS EARLIER WERE NORMAL. THE WOMAN DENIED ANY HISTORY OF BREAST TRAUMA, PRODROMAL ILLNESS, PAIN, PURULENT DRAINAGE, LOCAL SIGN OF INFECTION, NIGHT SWEATS, WEIGHT LOSS, POOR APPETITE OR FEVER. AT PHYSICAL EXAMINATION BREAST ASYMMETRY WAS OBVIOUS. THE RIGHT BREAST WAS SWOLLEN, FIRM AND SENSITIVE TO DEEP PALPATION. THE LEFT BREAST WAS NORMAL. NO SIGN OF LOCAL INFECTION WERE OBSERVED.
