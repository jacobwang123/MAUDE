161779|21378512|D|1||RPTR HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO REMOVE ANOTHER DEFLATED IMPLANT THIS PAST SATURDAY. IT HAD BEEN IN PLACE QUITE SATISFACTORILY FOR THREE YRS PREVIOUS. RPTR USED THE SAME TECHNIQUE FOR ITS REMOVAL AS FOR ITS ORIGINAL IMPLANT, THAT IS AN INFERIOR SEMI-CIRUM AREOLAR TRANS GLANDULAR, SUB PECTORAL APPROACH. AS RPTR REACHED THE BOTTOM OF THE BREAST TISSUE AND THE PECTORAL FASCIA, RPTR ENCOUNTERED A CYSTIC STRUCTURE AND WHEN DR DIVIDED THIS THEY DRAINED APPROX 30 CC'S OF SALINE. DIRECTLY BENEATH THIS WAS THE VALVE OF THE IMPLANT. THE TISSUE INGROWTH HAD BEEN LIFTED FOR AN AREA OF APPROX 2 TO 3 CM AROUND THE VALVE. THE REMAINDER OF THE IMPLANT WAS DENSELY, REPEAT DENSELY, ADHERENT TO THE TISSUES TO THE EXTENT THAT WHEN RPTR WAS ATTEMPTING TO SEPARATE IT BY DIGITAL DISSECTION, THEY TORE THE IMPLANT IN THE 10 TO 11 O'CLOCK AREA. DR THINKS BECAUSE OF THE DENSE ADHERENCE OF THE TISSUE AND THE BUBBLE DIRECTLY OVER THE VALVE THAT THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT THIS WAS A VALVE LEAKAGE. UNLIKE PREVIOUS VALVE LEAKAGES THAT RPTR HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO REMOVE, THIS DID NOT HAVE TISSUE INGROWTH AROUND THE STIRRUP. THERE WAS NO OBVIOUS TISSUE IN THE VALVE.

AS RPTR HAS IN THE PAST, RPTR ONCE AGAIN FOUND THAT THE TISSUE OF THE CAPSULE HAD GROWN AROUND THE STIRRUP, PULLING THE PLUG OUT OF THE VALVE. SINCE THE REMAINDER OF THE IMPLANT REMAINS INTACT, IT IS DR'S INTERPRETATION THAT THE VALVE FAILED AGAIN. BECAUSE OF DR'S UNFORTUNATE FREQUENT ENCOUNTERS WITH THIS EXACT PROBLEM RPTR WOULD ASK THAT MFR CONSIDER REDESIGNING THE VALVE SO THAT INSTEAD OF HAVING A STIRRUP, THE PLUG IS SECURED ON A FLAP OF SILASTIC ROUGHLY SQUARE OR RECTANGULAR, OR EVEN CIRCULAR IN SHAPE AND SECURED TO THE SHELL OF THE IMPLANT ON AT LEAST TWO SIDES IF IT IS SQUARE OR RECTANGULAR AND JUST GREATER THEN 180 DEGREES IF IT IS CIRCULAR. IN RPTR'S OPINION THIS WOULD SERVE TWO PURPOSES. THE FIRST WOULD BE TO PREVENT THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS KIND OF INGROWTH THAT COULD PULL THE PLUG AND THE SECOND WOULD BE IN CASES WHERE THERE IS LIMITED EXPOSURE IT WOULD DEFINE THE ORIENTATION OF AN ASYMMETRICAL IMPLANT SUCH AS FLAT TOPS.|NI|NI|03/25/1998|I|||*||157501.0|0HP|FWM|1.0||SALINE BREAST IMPLANT|Y|NI|700 WARD DR.||SANTA BARBARA|US|MCGHAN MEDICAL||CA|93111||NI|NI|True

THE PATIENT UNDERWENT SURGERY TO REMOVE THE LEFT IMPLANT, WHICH WAS FOUND TO BE TOTALLY DEFLATED.  EXAMINATION OF THE IMPLANT BY THE SURGEON NOTED AN OPENING OF APPROXIMATELY 7 MM IN LENGTH ON THE POSTERIOR SIDE THAT WAS LINEAR AND THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK.  THE BREAST IMPLANT POCKET WAS IRRIGATED WITH SALINE SOLUTION.  A CAPSULOTOMY WAS PERFORMED AROUND THE UPPER AND MEDIAL PERIMETER OF THE CAPSULE.  A SUBMUSCULAR POCKET WAS CREATED BELOW THE PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE FOR A GREATER DISTANCE UP THE CHEST WALL TO IMPROVE THE UPPER POLE OF THE BREAST APPEARANCE.  THE POCKET WAS IRRIGATED WITH SALINE SOLUTION.  A BREAST IMPLANT SIZER WAS PLACED.  A 210 CC VOLUME APPEARED TO PROVIDE THE BEST APPEARANCE; THEREFORE, A SMOOTH-WALLED INAMED SILICONE GEL-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT WITH A 210 CC VOLUME IN A STYLE 10 WAS SELECTED AND PLACED INTO THE BREAST IMPLANT POCKET.|UNK|UKNOWN|07/18/2005|V|||Y||613349.0|*|FWM|1.0||SALINE BREAST IMPLANT|Y|UNK|71 S.

IMPLANT DEFLATION CAN OCCUR IMMEDIATELY OR SLOWLY OVER A PERIOD OF DAYS AND IS NOTICED BY LOSS OF SIZE OR SHAPE OF YOUR BREAST. SOME IMPLANTS DEFLATE (OR RUPTURE) IN THE FIRST FEW MONTHS AFTER BEING IMPLANTED AND SOME DEFLATE AFTER SEVERAL YEARS. CAUSES OF DEFLATION INCLUDE DAMAGE BY SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS DURING SURGERY, OVERFILLING OR UNDERFILLING OF THE IMPLANT WITH SALINE SOLUTION, CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE, CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY, STRESS SUCH AS TRAUMA OR INTENSE PHYSICAL MANIPULATION, EXCESIVE COMPRESSION DURING MAMMOGRAPHIC IMAGING, UMBILICAL INCISION PLACEMENT, AND UNK/UNEXPLAINED REASONS. YOU SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE THAT THE BREAST IMPLANT MAY WEAR OUT OVER TIME AND DEFLATE/RUPTURE. DEFLATED IMPLANTS REQUIRE ADD'L SURGERY TO REMOVE AND TO POSSIBLY REPLACE THE IMPLANT."" DEVICE LABELING ADDRESSES THE POSSIBLE EVENT OR WRINKLING AS FOLLOWS: ""DISSATISFYING RESULTS SUCH AS WRINKLING, ASYMETRY IMPLANT DISPLACEMENT (SHIFTING), INCORRECT SIZE, UNANTICIPATED SHAPE, IMPLANT PALPABILITY, SCAR DEFORMITY, HYPERTROPHIC (IRREGULAR, RAISED SCAR) SCARRING, AND/OR SLOSHING MAY OCCUR. CAREFUL SURGICAL PLANNING AND TECHNIQUE CAN MINIMIZE BUT NOT ALWAYS PREVENT SUCH RESULTS."" DEVICE LABELING ADDRESSES THE POSSIBLE EVENT OF INFECTION AS FOLLOWS: ""INFECTION CAN OCCUR WITH ANY SURGERY. MOST INFECTIONS RESULTING FROM SURGERY APPEAR WITHIN A FEW DAYS TO WEEKS AFTER THE OPERATION. HOWEVER, INFECTION IS POSSIBLE AT ANY TIME AFTER SURGERY. INFECTIONS WITH AN IMPLANT PRESENT ARE HARDER TO TREAT THAN INFECTIONS IN NORMAL BODY TISSUES. IF AN INFECTION DOES NOT RESPOND TO ANTIBIOTICS, THE IMPLANT MAY HAVE TO BE REMOVED, AND ANOTHER IMPLANT MAY BE PLACED AFTER THE INFECTION IS RESOLVED. IN RARE INSTANCES, TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME HAS BEEN NOTED IN WOMEN AFTER BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY, AND IT IS A LIFE THREATENING CONDITION. SYMPTOMS INCLUDE SUDDEN FEVER, VOMITING, DIARRHEA, FAINTING, DIZZINESS, AND/OR SUNBURN-LIKE RASH. A DR SHOULD BE SEEN IMMEDIATELY FOR DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT."" DEVICE LABELING ADDRESSES THE POSSIBLE EVENT OF PAIN AS FOLLOWS: ""PAIN OF VARYING INTENSITY AND DURATION MAY OCCUR AND PERSIST FOLLOWING BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY. IN ADDITION, IMPROPER SIZE, PLACEMENT, SURGICAL TECHNIQUE, OR CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY RESULT IN PAIN ASSOCIATED WITH NERVE ENTRAPMENT OR INTERFERENCE WITH MUSCLE MOTION. YOU SHOULD TELL YOUR DR ABOUT SEVERE PAIN."" DEVICE LABELING ADDRESSES THE POSSIBLE EVENT OF CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE AS FOLLOWS: ""THE SCAR TISSUE OR CAPSULE THAT NORMALLY FORMS AROUND THE IMPLANT MAY TIGHTEN AND SQUEEZE THE IMPLANT AND IS CALLED CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE MAY BE MORE COMMON FOLLOWING INFECTION, HEMATOMA, AND SEROMA. IT IS ALSO MORE COMMON WITH SUBGLANDULAR PLACEMENT (BEHIND THE MAMMARY GLAND AND ON TOP OF THE CHEST). SYMPTOMS RANGE FROM MILD FIRMNESS AND MILD DISCOMFORT TO SEVERE PAIN, DISTORTED SHAPE, PALPABILITY OF THE IMPLANT, AND/OR MOVEMENT OF THE IMPLANT. ADDITIONAL SURGERY IS NEEDED IN CASES WHERE PAIN AND/OR FIRMNESS IS SEVERE. THIS SURGERY RANGES FROM REMOVAL OF THE IMPLANT CAPSULE TISSUE TO REMOVAL AND POSSIBLY REPLACEMENT OF THE IMPLANT ITSELF.

SURGERY WAS UNEVENTFUL, I HAD HUGE SWELLING UPPER LEFT BREAST AREA POST SURGERY. I WAS DISCHARGED THE NEXT DAY WITH 2 BREAST DRAINS AND INSTRUCTED TO FOLLOW-UP WITH SURGEON. I FOLLOWED UP WITH MY PLASTIC SURGEON AT LEAST TWICE A WEEK. BREAST SURGERY WAS VERY PAINFUL. ON THIRD WEEK POST-SURGERY, I HAD SEVERAL MEDICAL COMPLAINTS: HEADACHE, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, NUMBNESS OF FACE, AND EVENTUALLY MOTTLING, REDNESS AND SWELLING OF LEFT BREAST, SWELLING ON PORT BELOW INTRA-MAMMARY FOLD. I HAD SEVERAL VISITS TO URGENT CARE, EMERGENCY HOSPITAL, AND DOCTORS' OFFICES. I DEVELOPED FEVER AND CELLULITIS ON BREAST; WHICH FELT LIKE A BALLOON. I WENT TO URGENT CARE ON (B)(6) 2012; WAS GIVEN VANCOMYCIN IV. THE NEXT DAY, I FELT THAT THE LEFT BREAST DEFLATED AND AREA AROUND PORT (INTRA-MAMMARY FOLD) FILLED WITH MORE FLUID. I SAW MY SURGEON WHO ORDERED ADMISSION TO HOSPITAL FOR SURGICAL EXPLANTATION, IRRIGATION, AND DEBRIDEMENT. SURGERY WAS PERFORMED ON THE NEXT DAY, (B)(6) 2012. CLOUDY SEROMA AND GRANULATION TISSUE WAS EVACUATED AND SALINE BREAST EXPANDER AND PORT WAS REMOVED. SAMPLES OF FLUID AND TISSUE WERE SUBMITTED FOR CULTURE AND SENSITIVITY TESTING, BUT NO HISTOPATHOLOGICAL SAMPLES WERE TAKEN. SHE SAID THAT THE IMPLANT WILL BE SUBMITTED FOR EXAMINATION AND THEN RETURNED TO MFR. I WAS GIVEN CONTINUOUS VANCOMYCIN TREATMENT FOR 2 DAYS AND WAS PRESCRIBED CIPRO AND ORAL PAIN MEDS. I HAD FOLLOW-UP VISITS AT HER OFFICE AND 2 DRAIN TUBES WERE REMOVED AFTER SEVERAL DAYS. THE INITIAL CULTURE TEST RESULTS AT (B)(6) CAME OUT AS ACID-FAST BACILLI, A FAST GROWER. I SAW AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR FOR EMPIRICAL TREATMENT WHILE WAITING FOR SENSITIVITY TESTING RESULTS. I STARTED WITH A COMBINATION TREATMENT OF CLARITHROMYCIN AND DOXYCYCLINE. THE TREATMENT WAS CONCURRED BY MY CURRENT INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR AT (B)(6) HOSPITAL. THE SAMPLE WAS SENT TO (B)(6) FOR FURTHER IDENTIFICATION AND SENSITIVITY TESTING. RESULTS OF THE TEST IDENTIFIED AS M. FORTUITUM, SENSITIVE TO CLARITHROMYCIN, BUT RESISTANT TO DOXYCYCLINE. MY INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR, REPLACED THE DOXYCYCLINE TO CIPRO IN COMBINATION WITH CLARITHROMYCIN. I FINALLY CONSULTED WITH (B)(6); WELL KNOWN EXPERTS IN DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF MYCOBACTERIAL INFECTIONS. I WANTED TO GET A ""DEFINITE REGARDING CAUSE"" OF PERSISTENT FIBRINOUS NODULAR TISSUE ON MY LEFT BREAST AND AXILLA. I FINALLY SAW AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR, WHO THEN PRESENTED MY CASE FOR REVIEW AT THEIR DEPARTMENT STAFF MEETING. ASSESSMENT WAS POSSIBLE MYCOBACTERIUM FORTUITUM IATROGENIC HEALTH CARE ASSOCIATED INFECTION OF THE LEFT BREAST IMPLANT. BECAUSE OF ABSENCE OF PERI-OPERATIVE PATHOLOGY TO LOOK FOR GRANULOMAS, NOR ABILITY TO RE-CULTURE THE SITE, PLAN WAS TO GET MRI OF RESIDUAL BREAST TISSUE AND CONSULT WITH SURGEON WHO SPECIALIZED IN MYCOBACTERIAL INFECTIONS. MRI RESULTS: SOME ABNORMAL FINDINGS, BUT COULD NOT RULE OUT IF THIS IS DUE TO INFECTIOUS DISEASE OR POST-SURGICAL CHANGES. I SAW A SURGEON AT (B)(6). SHE CONCURRED WITH (B)(6) TREATMENT OF 6 MONTHS ANTIBIOTICS AND RETURN APPOINTMENT FOR REASSESSMENT IN 3 MONTHS. ANTIBIOTIC COMBINATION WERE PRESCRIBED, CHANGED FROM TIME TO TIME TO PREVENT BACTERIAL RESISTANCE AND SIDE EFFECTS. ON THE LAST FEW WEEKS OF TREATMENT, I WAS SWITCHED TO TAKING SULFISOXAZOLE/TRIMETHOPRIM ALONE BECAUSE I WAS NOT ABLE TO TOLERATE THE SIDE EFFECTS FROM AVELOX, CIPRO, ETC. ON (B)(6) 2012, I HAD A RETURN DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT AND MRI AND BLOOD TEST AT (B)(6). SURGEON'S ASSESSMENT WAS THAT I HAVE NO APPARENT LESION OF MYCOBACTERIAL DISEASE. MY INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR WITHDREW ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT ON (B)(6). I STARTED HAVING STOMACH PAINS RIGHT AFTER I WITHDREW MY ANTIBIOTIC TREATMENT. THE PAIN CONTINUED AND SPREAD ON THE ABDOMEN SPECIALLY ON THE LEFT LOWER QUADRANT. MY OBGYN DOCTOR PERFORMED ENDOMETRIAL BIOPSY WHICH RESULT WAS NEGATIVE. MY GASTROENTEROLOGIST ALSO PERFORMED COLONOSCOPY LAST WEEK AND AWAITING FOR RESULTS OF THE BIOPSY. HE SUGGESTED BREATH TEST TO RULE OUT SIBO. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF I GET AN IMPROVEMENT FROM THE COLON CLEANSING BEFORE I SCHEDULE TESTING. I AM CURRENTLY TAKING PROBIOTICS AND PANTOPRAZOLE 40 MG DAILY AND I HAVE SEEN IMPROVEMENT SINCE COLONOSCOPY."|BREAST IMPLANT EXPANDER/SMOOTH ROUND SPECTRUM SALINE||12/11/2012||||R|||0HP|FWM|1.0||SALINE BREAST IMPLANT (EXPANDER)||6503382|201 MENTOR DR||SANTA BARBARA|US|MENTOR CORP|93111|CA|93111||REF 350-1480||True
