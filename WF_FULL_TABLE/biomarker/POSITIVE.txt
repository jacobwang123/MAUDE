ATTEMPTING TO REMOVE THE POSTERIOR CAPSULE RESULTED IN BLEEDING, SO THE POSTERIOR CAPSULES AND CHEST WALL WERE LEFT IN PLACE. 6 MOS AFTER EXPLANTATION, BREASTS BECAME SWOLLEN AND SEVERELY PAINFUL - SO TENDER THAT CLOTHES COULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO TOUCH THEM. USER WENT TO PAIN CLINIC FOR 2 YEARS, RECEIVED PAIN MEDICATION, ADD'L SURGERY AND WAS REFERRED TO HAVE A NEUROLOGY CONSULTATION. THE PAIN MEDICATION AND TREATMENTS HAVEN'T BEEN EFFECTIVE SO FAR, BUT THE DRS PERSIST IN TRYING TO HELP. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: BILATERAL CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. MATERIAL FORWARDED TO LAB FOR EXAMINATION: 1. IMPLANT RIGHT BREAST. 2. IMPLANT LEFT BREAST. 3. RIGHT BREAST IMPLANT CAPSULE. 4. LEFT BREAST IMPLANT CAPSULE. OPERATION PERFORMED: EXPLANTATION AND ANTERIOR CAPSULECTOMY BILATERAL BREASTS. DATE OF OPERATION: 1996. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: INDICATIONS: THIS PT IS A 45-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH A HISTORY OF BILATERAL IMPLANTS AFTER SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMIES IN 1984. SHE HAS HAD INCREASE IN DISTORTION AND PAIN OVER ONE YEAR AND WISHES TO HAVE THE IMPLANTS REMOVED. I HAVE DISCUSSED MULTIPLE RECONSTRUCTIVE OPTIONS WITH THIS PT IN DETAIL AND AT THIS TIME SHE CURRENTLY WISHES TO HAVE EXPLANT ONLY. PROCEDURE: THE PT WAS BROUGHT IN THE OR AND PLACED IN A SUPINE POSITION WHERE SATISFACTORY GENERAL ENDOTRACHEAL ANESTHESIA WAS PERFORMED. SHE WAS THEN PREPPED AND DRAPED IN THE NORMAL STERILE MANNER. AFTER STERILE PREPPING AND DRAPING, AN INCISION WAS PERFORMED ON THE RIGHT BREAST LATERALLY THROUGH THE OLD MASTECTOMY INCISION. DISSECTION WAS CARRIED DOWN THROUGH SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE TO THE IMPLANT. THE IMPLANT AND IMPLANT GAPS WERE DISSECTED FREE SUPERIORLY, MEDIALLY AND LATERALLY AND WHEN THE LIMITS OF DISSECTION WERE REACHED THE CAPSULE WAS OPENED AND THE IMPLANT WAS REMOVED. THE IMPLANT WAS NOTED TO BE INTACT BUT WAS NOTED TO BE A MCGHAN 320 CC IMPLANT. THE ANTERIOR CAPSULE WAS THEN REMOVED AND THE POSTERIOR CAPSULE AND THE CHEST WALL WERE LEFT INTACT, AS THERE WAS NO RUPTURE AND ATTEMPTING TO GET THIS CAPSULE OFF RESULTED IN SOME BLEEDING. THEREFORE, THIS WAS ABANDONED. ATTENTION WAS DIRECTED TO THE CONTRALATERAL SIDE, WHERE A SIMILAR INCISION WAS MADE AND DISSECTION ONCE AGAIN CARRIED DOWN THROUGH SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE TO THE IMPLANT CAPSULE. DISSECTION AGAIN PROCEEDED SUPERIORLY, MEDIALLY AND LATERALLY AND THE IMPLANT CAPSULE WAS OPENED AND INTACT IMPLANT WAS REMOVED. THIS WAS ALSO A MCGHAN 320 CC IMPLANT. THE ANTERIOR CAPSULE WAS THEN REMOVED. THE WOUNDS WERE THOROUGHLY AND COPIOUSLY IRRIGATED AND A JACKSON-PRATT DRAIN WAS PLACED THROUGH A SEPARATE STAB INCISION; AND THE WOUND WAS CLOSED IN LAYERS. THE DEEP TISSUE WAS CLOSED USING INTERRUPTED 4-0 VICRYL. DEEP DERMIS WAS CLOSED USING 4-0 VICRYL AND THE SKIN WAS CLOSED USING A RUNNING 6-0 NYLON. THE PT TOLERATED THE PROCEDURE WELL AND WAS EXTUBATED IN THE OR AND WAS TAKEN TO THE RECOVERY ROOM IN STABLE CONDITION. DOCTOR'S PROGRESS NOTE STATES ""PT S/P REMOVAL OF RT BREAST IMPLANT IN 1996. PT STATES RT BREAST BECAME SORE LAST NIGHTIN INFERIOR AND SUPERIOR ASPECT OF RT BREAST. PT STATES WHOLE BREAST IS NOW VERY SORE AND NOW IT RADIATES TO RT AXILLA AND BACK. PT DESCRIBES PAIN AND CONSTANT 'BURNING LIKE IT IS ON FIRE'.  PT STATES LEFT SIDE IS NOW STARTING TO HURT. SHE NOTICED THE RT BREAST WAS RED AND REDDNESS HAS SPREAD. PT ALSO HAS EDEMA OF RT BREAST.

DOCUMENTED DYSPHAGIA. 9. DOCUMENTED ALOPECIA. 11. DOCUMENTED SLEEP DISTURBANCES. 13. DOCUMENTED CHRONIC CYSTITIS OR BLADDER IRRITABILITY. 17. BURNING PAIN IN THE CHEST, BREAST AND ARMS. BASED ON THIS ASSESSMENT, THIS WOMAN HAS AT LEAST 1 FROM GROUP I (A), 1 FROM GROUP II (B), AND 9 FROM GROUP III (C), AND THEREFORE MEETS THE SCHEDULE CRITERIA FOR ATYPICAL CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE. THE DATE OF ONSET OF THE QUALIFYING SYMPTOMS AND CURRENT LEVEL OF DISABILITY WAS IN 1988 AT AGE 60. 1. HER IMPLANTS WERE PLACED IN 1978. 2. THEY WERE REMOVED 1991. I HAVE THE INFO NECESSARY TO FORM A PROFESSIONAL OPINION ABOUT THE PT'S DISABILITY, WHICH IS BASED ON MY EXAMINATION OF THE PT, INCLUDING A MEDICAL HISTORY AND ASSESSMENT OF HER FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY, AND ON THE PT'S MEDICAL RECORDS. THIS PT IS IN SEVERITY/DISABILITY COMPENSATION CATEGORY B, 35% DISABLED, DUE TO THE COMPENSABLE CONDITION, BECAUSE SHE DEMONSTRATES A LOSS OF FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY WHICH RENDERS HER UNABLE TO PERFORM SOME OF HER USUAL ACTIVITIES OF VOCATION, AVOCATION AND SELF-CARE. OTHER MEDICAL PROBLEMS WHICH ARE UNRELATED OR ONLY INDIRECTLY RELATED TO HER IMPLANTS CONTRIBUTE TO DISABILITY EXTENDING BEYOND THE 35% LEVEL."" PHYSICIAN WRITES, ""I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST POINT OUT THAT I INITIALLY SAW AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONSULTANT DURING HER HOSPITALIZATION IN JUNE OF 1978. AT THAT TIME, SHE HAD UNDERGONE BILATERAL BREAST REMOVAL WITH THE SUBSEQUENT REPLACEMENT OF SILASTIC IMPLANTS. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING SURGERY, SHE DEVELOPED A FEVER THAT PERSISTED. NO OBVIOUS SIGN OF INFECTION WAS DETECTED. AT THE TIME I SAW HER, HER FEVER WAS IN THE RANGE OF 101-102 AND HAD REMAINED IN THAT RANGE FOR THE PREVIOUS 7-10 DAYS, DESPITE PERIODS OF ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY, INCLUDING BOTH KEFLEX AND KEFLIN. THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT ABNORMALITY FOUND AT THAT TIME WAS A SLIGHT ELEVATION OF HER ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE, LDH, AND SGOT. ON THAT BASIS, SEROLOGIC STUDIES FOR POSSIBLE CAUSES OF HEPATITIS WERE UNDERTAKEN AND WERE ALL WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS. HOWEVER, SUBSEQUENT CONVALESCENT TITERS WERE OBTAINED, AND A RISE IN TITER OF CYTOMEGALY VIRUS SEROLOGY BETWEEN JULY 3 AND JULY 12, 1978, SHOWED A RISE FROM LESS THAN 1:8 TO A TITER OF 1:256. THIS SEROLOGIC CHANGE IS DIAGNOSTIC FOR CYTOMEGALOVIRUS, AND THEREFORE, I FEEL THE DIAGNOSIS OF CYTOMEGALOVIRUS HEPATITIS WAS ESTABLISHED. I HAVE SEEN HER IN FOLLOWUP, AT WHICH TIME HER LIVER FUNCTION TESTS HAVE RESOLVED COMPLETELY. SHE HAS SUBSEQUENTLY UNDERGONE A REVISION OF HER MAMMOPLASTY. PARENTHETICALLY, I WOULD POINT OUT THAT AS PART OF HER INITIAL WORK-UP, THERE WAS SOME CONCERN AS TO WHETHER SHE WAS HAVING A REACTION TO THE MATERIAL OF THE ORIGINAL IMPLANTS, AND THEREFORE, THESE WERE REMOVED, TO BE REPLACED APPROX ONE MONTH AGO. SHE HANDLED THE SECOND SURGERY VERY WELL, INDEED, AND AT THIS STAGE, TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE, IS TOTALLY ASYMPTOMATIC."""|MCGHAN|25-20-240|03/20/1999|M|||N||210148.0|0LP|FTR|1.0||SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS|Y|UNK|700 S.

I STARTED TO ITCH IMMEDIATELY, AND BECAME ALLERGIC TO MANY THINGS. MY BODY FELT FATIGUED, I HAD MIGRAINE HEADACHES, AND COULDN'T SLEEP. I BEGAN TO ACHE ALL OVER, HAD PANIC ATTACKS, MY VISION CHANGED RAPIDLY. I KEPT REPORTING VARIOUS COMPLAINTS TO MY PHYSICIANS, NO ONE COULD HELP ME, EVEN THOUGH THEY KEPT TRYING. I BECAME DEPRESSED, MY WHOLE BODY BEGAN TO CHANGE, MY BREASTS WERE ITCHING DEEP INSIDE, WERE COMPLETELY NUMB. THEY WERE HOT TO TOUCH, AND PAINFUL, I WAS TOLD IT WOULD GO AWAY. THE SYMPTOMS PROGRESSED RAPIDLY, EACH TIME THEY WENT BACK IN, THEY USED THE SAME IMPLANTS, EVEN REFILLED THE ONE THAT LEAKED. MY MAMMOGRAMS SHOWED A BULGE, THE RADIOLOGIST ADVISED ME TO REMOVE THEM, THE PLASTIC SURGEON DENIED WHAT THE FILM SHOWED. I HAD A SONOGRAM LATER, AND IT SHOWED MY LYMPH NODES WERE SWOLLEN. THEY IDENTIFIED GEL OUTSIDE OF THE CAPSULES. MY HEALTH WAS DECLINING RAPIDLY. THE NURSES TOLD ME ABOUT THE ADVERSE EFFECTS, TWO MONTHS BEFORE THIS LITIGATION WAS TO CLOSE. I HAD TO SEE AN INTERNAL SPECIALIST, WHO DIAGNOSED ME WITH SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS, SO DID A RHEUMATOLOGIST, AND SO DID A NEUROLOGIST. I HAVE SEIZURES, CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDER, ATYPICAL LUPUS, SJOGREN'S, RAYNAUD'S, NUMEROUS OTHER CONDITIONS. I HAVE BEEN HOSPITALIZED, GONE TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM, STAYED HOME BECAUSE I AM NOW UNEMPLOYABLE. NO ONE WILL INSURE ME NOW, AND THIS IS A PARTIAL LIST OF MY SYMPTOMS, AND DISORDERS. I AM POSITIVE MY PATHOLOGIST'S REPORT SHOWED A HOLE IN MY IMPLANT. MY VISION IS VERY IMPAIRED NOW. I CAN'T GET OUT OF BED, WITHOUT HELP, AND I AM CONSTANTLY ILL. I AM IN HORRENDOUS PAIN EACH DAY. MY MEMORY IS IMPAIRED SIGNIFICANTLY. I GET LOST, I CAN'T EVEN SHOP FOR GROCERIES, OR COOK A MEAL NOW. I DON'T GO INTO A DEEP SLEEP PATTERN, MY BRAIN STAYS ON RUN, WHILE MY BODY CRIES IN PAIN. MY LEGS AND FEET STAY SWOLLEN HUGE. MY FINGERS DON'T MOVE, I HAVE CRAMPS IN MY HANDS, LEGS, AND FEET THAT MAKE MY HANDS DRAW INTO GNARLS. I HAVE NIGHT SWEATS, MY FACE IS GETTING A PINK RASH OVER MY NOSE. MY BRAIN HAS ELECTRIC LIGHT SHOWS, AND I WAKE UP EXHAUSTED. MY WHOLE LIFE HAS CHANGED. MY IMMUNE SYSTEM IS COMPROMISED, I CAN'T BE AROUND ANYONE WHO IS ILL, OR I GET ILL. I'M SO ALLERGIC TO ALL CHEMICALS, I HAVE SEVERE REACTIONS TO THEM. MY VOICE HAS CHANGED, MY SPEECH IS SLURRED, I'M NOT ME NOW. MY FACE HAS BROKEN OUT IN BLISTERS, I'M ALLERGIC TO THE SUN, AND I HAVE ASTHMA NOW. I CAN'T BEGIN TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAS HAPPENED. I HAVE SOMEONE TYPING FOR ME, MY BRAIN CAN'T PUT THE WORDS TOGETHER NOW. I HAD NONE OF THESE PROBLEMS BEFORE IMPLANTS. I WAS NEVER TOLD OF THE CHEMICALS IN IMPLANTS. I WAS TOLD THAT IT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER TO DETECT BREAST CANCER. I HAD FIBRO-CYSTIC BREAST DISEASE. I AM POSITIVE THE IMPLANTS ARE WHAT HAS CAUSED ME TO BECOME EXTREMELY DISABLED, I AM FORCED TO FILE FOR DISABILITY. I WOULD RATHER BE THE PRODUCTIVE PERSON I WAS BEFORE I HAD SILICONE IMPLANTS. I RARELY AM ABLE TO GO OUT. I CAN'T HOLD MY GRANDBABIES OR PARTICIPATE IN A NORMAL LIFE. I AM SEXUALLY NOT A LADY NOW. I CAN'T HAVE A CLIMAX, MY VAGINA IS SO DRY, AND PAINFUL. WHY DID THE FDA ALLOW THIS? I THOUGHT IMPLANTS WERE SAFE, AND HAD BEEN APPROVED. NOW I'M READING I'VE BEEN TOXICALLY POISONED. I TRY TO USE MY MIND TO CONTROL PAIN. I AM ILL, I WANT TO BE WELL, I WANT TO BE FREE FROM ALL OF THE THINGS I HAVE WRONG WITH ME NOW. I TRY SO HARD, BUT I CAN'T DO THINGS. I WILL NEVER GIVE UP TRYING. I WISH I WAS WELL ENOUGH TO BE ME AGAIN NOW. I STAY AWAY FROM THE DOCTORS, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY MORE. I CAN'T HEAR WELL, AND I'M SO TIRED. I DON'T LEAD A NORMAL LIFE. I'M SICK, AND I'M JUST TRYING TO HIDE FROM ANY MORE TESTS, OR HOSPS. THESE CHEST PAINS WERE NEVER NORMAL FOR A 35 YEAR OLD LADY WHO EXERCIZED, WAS PHYSICALLY IN SHAPE. NOW I CAN'T RAISE MY ARMS, THE PAIN GOES FROM MY BREAST CLEAR DOWN TO MY FINGERTIPS. I CAN'T TELL YOU ANY MORE, IT'S TOO UPSETTING TO LOOK AT. I HAD A HYSTERECTOMY, I HEMORRHAGED FOR MONTHS. I'VE HAD A KIDNEY STONE, MY BLADDER IS BLOCKED, INFECTED ALL THE TIME, AND THEY CAN'T DO SURGERY. I HAVE A YEAST INFECTION CONTINUALLY. MY NAILS HAVE HAD A FUNGUS. MY SKIN HAS HUGE BLOOD PLACES THE SIZE OF A MAN'S HAND, ON MY FOREARMS ALWAYS, MY SKIN IS LIKE TISSUE PAPER. I FREEZE WHEN IT IS 90 DEGREES. SINUS, OH I COULD JUST KEEP GOING ON, AND ON BUT I WON'T. I THINK YOU HAVE READ ENOUGH. I'M BACK IN KINDERGARTEN, AND I WAS INTELLIGENT ONCE.

THERE WAS SOME DEBRIS OF DEFECT WITHIN THE FLUID. THE PATIENT THEN UNDERWENT A NEEDLE ASPIRATION OF THE FLUID FROM THE LEFT BREAST AND APPROX. 275 ML OF YELLOWISH FLUID WAS COLLECTED. THE FLUID SHOWED A LARGE ATYPICAL LYMPHOCYTE IN THE BACKGROUND OF MIXED SMALL LYMPHOCYTE AND HISTIOCYTE. IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL STUDY PERFORMED ON THE CELL BLOCK SHOWED THAT THESE LYMPHOID CELLS WERE POSITIVE FOR LCA AND NEGATIVE FOR CHEM CAP 5.2 AND CD 68.

I MADE THE DECISION 9 YEARS AGO TO HAVE MY BREASTS LIFTED HERE IN (B)(6). WHEN I WENT IN FOR MY FIRST CONSULTATION, THE PLASTIC SURGEON CONVINCED ME THAT I NOT ONLY NEEDED A LIFT BUT BREAST IMPLANTS AS WELL TO HAVE A BETTER OUTCOME OF THE PROCEDURE. IT ALSO ADDED ROUGHLY (B)(6) MORE TO THE LIFT MAKING THE TOTAL (B)(6). I WAS A SMALL SAGGY C CUP BEFORE MY LIFT WITH SMOOTH SALINE IMPLANTS UNDER THE MUSCLE. WHEN I HEALED FROM SURGERY, I WAS A DD, NOT WHAT I ASKED FOR. I HAD TOLD THE PS THAT I WANTED TO BA A FULL C MAY BE A SMALL D BUT NO BIGGER AND HE AGREED, ABOUT A YEAR LATER, I STARTED NOTICING THAT I WAS FEELING MORE TIRED THAN MY NORMAL SELF AND THAT I WAS HAVING CLOUDY THINKING INSTEAD OF MY USUAL SHARP SELF. I WAS ALSO EXPERIENCING MUSCLE PAIN AND STIFFNESS IN MY NECK SHOULDERS AND UPPER BACK. THE SYMPTOMS PROGRESSED A LITTLE WORSE EACH YEAR UNTIL FINAL THIS YEAR THE BRAIN FOG AND FATIGUE WAS SO BAD THAT I COULD NO LONGER FUNCTION. I STARTED SEEING EVERY SPECIALIST I COULD THINK OF. I WENT TO MY PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR SEVERAL TIMES AND HAD HIM RUN EVERY BLOOD TEST THERE IS AND THE RESULTS WERE ALWAYS THE SAME, NORMAL. SO I WENT TO SEE A CARDIOLOGIST, GYNECOLOGIST, PULMONOLOGIST, AND A NEUROLOGIST. THEY ALL RAN SEVERAL TESTS INCLUDING MRIS, CT SCANS, X-RAYS, 24 HR HEART TELEMETRY, ULTRASOUNDS AND MORE BLOOD WORK. AFTER MY MILLION DOLLAR WORK-UP, I AGAIN WAS TOLD THAT NONE OF THEM COULD FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH ME. SO MY PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR TOLD ME THAT I MUST BE DEPRESSED AND TRIED TO PRESCRIBE ME AN ANTI-DEPRESSANT, I SAID NO THANK YOU! I STARTED RESEARCHING BREAST IMPLANTS WITH BRAIN FOG AND FATIGUE AND FOUND SO MANY OTHER WOMEN HAVING THESE SAME TYPES OF SYMPTOMS AND I DECIDED THAT MAY BE IT'S NOT JUST A COINCIDENCE. I STARTED CALLING PS AROUND ME IN THE ""WORLD FAMOUS"" (B)(6) MEDICAL CTR AND THEY ALL TOLD ME I WAS CRAZY BECAUSE ""I HAD THE SAFE SALINE IMPLANTS THAT THEY EVEN PUT IN CANCER PATIENTS."" THAT'S WHEN ALL OF MY RESEARCH AND GOOGLING LED ME TO ALL OF THE POSITIVE REVIEWS OF DR (B)(6). I GAVE HIS OFFICE A CALL AND I WAS TREATED LIKE A PERSON WITH A VALID COMPLAINT OF MY SYMPTOMS AND HIS OFFICE ASSURED ME THAT I WAS NOT CRAZY AND THAT DR (B)(6) HAD DONE CLOSE TO (B)(6) OF THESE EXPLANTS BOTH SALINE AND SILICONE AND THE WOMEN ARE BETTER AFTER THEIR IMPLANT REMOVAL. I READ LETTERS OF WOMEN THANKING DR (B)(6) FOR GIVING THEM THEIR LIVES BACK! SO I SET A DATE 2 WEEKS AFTER FIRST SPEAKING WITH HIS OFFICE (LUCKILY THEY HAD A CANCELLATION) AND I AM NOW IMPLANT FREE! DR (B)(6) WAS AMAZING! HE IS SO LOVING AND CARING AND TAKES THE TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU NOT ONLY UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN SURGERY AND TO YOUR BREASTS BUT HE TREATS YOU LIKE FAMILY, HIS WHOLE OFFICE DOES. I FELT SO SAFE AND CARED FOR, ALMOST LIKE HIS OWN CHILD. HE EASED ALL OF MY FEARS AND ANXIETY WITH HIS WARM AND HUMOROUS PERSONALITY, HE HAS AN AMAZING BEDSIDE MANNER. EVERYTHING THAT HE TOLD ME WOULD HAPPEN, HAPPENED EXACTLY THE WAY HE SAID IT WOULD. EVEN THE AMBULATORY SURGERY CTR WAS AMAZING, THEY MAKE YOU FEEL SO COMFORTABLE AND CARED FOR. THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST WAS ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL, NOT ONLY DID HE MAKE ME FEEL VERY CARED FOR HE MADE SURE THAT I HAD NO NAUSEA OR ANY OTHER COMPLICATION OF THE GENERAL ANESTHESIA. I TYPICALLY HAVE EXTREME NAUSEA AND I HAD NONE, NOT EVENT THE SLIGHTEST BIT OF NAUSEA! SINCE TUESDAY, I HAVE ALREADY NOTICED HUGE CHANGES. NOT ONLY DO MY BREASTS LOOK AMAZING, LIKE I HAD ORIGINALLY WANTED, A LIFTED C, BUT MY SYMPTOMS ARE IMPROVING! I HAD A LUMP IN MY NECK ON THE RIGHT SIDE CLOSE TO THE BASE OF MY SKULL AND IT DISAPPEARED THE SAME NIGHT AS MY SURGERY! THIS LUMP GAVE ME SO MUCH PAIN AND I WAS ALWAYS TRYING TO MASSAGE IT OUT AND IT HAS VANISHED! IT'S BEEN ONLY 3 FULL DAYS SINCE THE EXPLANT WITH LIFT AND MY BRAIN IS CLEAR, NO MORE FOGGINESS, NO MORE FATIGUE!"|SMOOTH SALINE BREAST IMPLANT|*|10/09/2014|||||||000|FWM|1.0||BREAST IMPLANT||*|*||*|*|MENTOR|||||*|*|True

WHEN I HEALED FROM SURGERY, I WAS A DD, NOT WHAT I ASKED FOR. I HAD TOLD THE PS THAT I WANTED TO BA A FULL C MAY BE A SMALL D BUT NO BIGGER AND HE AGREED, ABOUT A YEAR LATER, I STARTED NOTICING THAT I WAS FEELING MORE TIRED THAN MY NORMAL SELF AND THAT I WAS HAVING CLOUDY THINKING INSTEAD OF MY USUAL SHARP SELF. I WAS ALSO EXPERIENCING MUSCLE PAIN AND STIFFNESS IN MY NECK SHOULDERS AND UPPER BACK. THE SYMPTOMS PROGRESSED A LITTLE WORSE EACH YEAR UNTIL FINAL THIS YEAR THE BRAIN FOG AND FATIGUE WAS SO BAD THAT I COULD NO LONGER FUNCTION. I STARTED SEEING EVERY SPECIALIST I COULD THINK OF. I WENT TO MY PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR SEVERAL TIMES AND HAD HIM RUN EVERY BLOOD TEST THERE IS AND THE RESULTS WERE ALWAYS THE SAME, NORMAL. SO I WENT TO SEE A CARDIOLOGIST, GYNECOLOGIST, PULMONOLOGIST, AND A NEUROLOGIST. THEY ALL RAN SEVERAL TESTS INCLUDING MRIS, CT SCANS, X-RAYS, 24 HR HEART TELEMETRY, ULTRASOUNDS AND MORE BLOOD WORK. AFTER MY MILLION DOLLAR WORK-UP, I AGAIN WAS TOLD THAT NONE OF THEM COULD FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH ME. SO MY PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR TOLD ME THAT I MUST BE DEPRESSED AND TRIED TO PRESCRIBE ME AN ANTI-DEPRESSANT, I SAID NO THANK YOU! I STARTED RESEARCHING BREAST IMPLANTS WITH BRAIN FOG AND FATIGUE AND FOUND SO MANY OTHER WOMEN HAVING THESE SAME TYPES OF SYMPTOMS AND I DECIDED THAT MAY BE IT'S NOT JUST A COINCIDENCE. I STARTED CALLING PS AROUND ME IN THE ""WORLD FAMOUS"" (B)(6) MEDICAL CTR AND THEY ALL TOLD ME I WAS CRAZY BECAUSE ""I HAD THE SAFE SALINE IMPLANTS THAT THEY EVEN PUT IN CANCER PATIENTS."" THAT'S WHEN ALL OF MY RESEARCH AND GOOGLING LED ME TO ALL OF THE POSITIVE REVIEWS OF DR (B)(6). I GAVE HIS OFFICE A CALL AND I WAS TREATED LIKE A PERSON WITH A VALID COMPLAINT OF MY SYMPTOMS AND HIS OFFICE ASSURED ME THAT I WAS NOT CRAZY AND THAT DR (B)(6) HAD DONE CLOSE TO (B)(6) OF THESE EXPLANTS BOTH SALINE AND SILICONE AND THE WOMEN ARE BETTER AFTER THEIR IMPLANT REMOVAL. I READ LETTERS OF WOMEN THANKING DR (B)(6) FOR GIVING THEM THEIR LIVES BACK! SO I SET A DATE 2 WEEKS AFTER FIRST SPEAKING WITH HIS OFFICE (LUCKILY THEY HAD A CANCELLATION) AND I AM NOW IMPLANT FREE! DR (B)(6) WAS AMAZING! HE IS SO LOVING AND CARING AND TAKES THE TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU NOT ONLY UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN SURGERY AND TO YOUR BREASTS BUT HE TREATS YOU LIKE FAMILY, HIS WHOLE OFFICE DOES. I FELT SO SAFE AND CARED FOR, ALMOST LIKE HIS OWN CHILD. HE EASED ALL OF MY FEARS AND ANXIETY WITH HIS WARM AND HUMOROUS PERSONALITY, HE HAS AN AMAZING BEDSIDE MANNER. EVERYTHING THAT HE TOLD ME WOULD HAPPEN, HAPPENED EXACTLY THE WAY HE SAID IT WOULD. EVEN THE AMBULATORY SURGERY CTR WAS AMAZING, THEY MAKE YOU FEEL SO COMFORTABLE AND CARED FOR. THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST WAS ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL, NOT ONLY DID HE MAKE ME FEEL VERY CARED FOR HE MADE SURE THAT I HAD NO NAUSEA OR ANY OTHER COMPLICATION OF THE GENERAL ANESTHESIA. I TYPICALLY HAVE EXTREME NAUSEA AND I HAD NONE, NOT EVENT THE SLIGHTEST BIT OF NAUSEA! SINCE TUESDAY, I HAVE ALREADY NOTICED HUGE CHANGES. NOT ONLY DO MY BREASTS LOOK AMAZING, LIKE I HAD ORIGINALLY WANTED, A LIFTED C, BUT MY SYMPTOMS ARE IMPROVING! I HAD A LUMP IN MY NECK ON THE RIGHT SIDE CLOSE TO THE BASE OF MY SKULL AND IT DISAPPEARED THE SAME NIGHT AS MY SURGERY! THIS LUMP GAVE ME SO MUCH PAIN AND I WAS ALWAYS TRYING TO MASSAGE IT OUT AND IT HAS VANISHED! IT'S BEEN ONLY 3 FULL DAYS SINCE THE EXPLANT WITH LIFT AND MY BRAIN IS CLEAR, NO MORE FOGGINESS, NO MORE FATIGUE!"|SMOOTH SALINE BREAST IMPLANT|*|10/09/2014|||||||000|FWM|2.0||BREAST IMPLANT||*|*||*|*|MENTOR|||||*|*|True

5004369|23148611|D|1||I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY CORRESPONDENCE FROM MENTOR ABOUT PROBLEMS OR FAULTY IMPLANTS OR ANY IMPLANT STUDY; NEITHER HAVE ANY OF MY FRIENDS WHO HAD IMPLANTS DUE TO CANCER. IN 1990 I HAD A LEFT BREAST RECONSTRUCTED AFTER A MASTECTOMY IN 1989. I HAD ONLY ONE TROUBLE-FREE YEAR WITH THE MENTOR BECKER PROSTHESIS. I COMPLAINED OFTEN TO MY PS DOCTOR THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS CAUSING SEVERE ITCHING, CHANGING SHAPE AND MAKING LUMPY SPOTS ON MY TORSO. IN 2002, I HAD XRAYS SHOWING ALL THE SALINE HAD LEAKED OUT AND THE SILICONE WAS LEAKING INTO THE BROKEN SALINE BAG. THE PS AGREED TO TAKE IT OUT, BUT WANTED TO REPLACE IT WITH A DIFFERENT KIND, A MENTOR SALINE PRODUCT. I WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A QUICK SURGERY AND GO HOME THAT DAY; INSTEAD, THE SURGERY TOOK FOUR HOURS, I SPENT SEVERAL PAINFUL DAYS IN THE HOSPITAL AND A WEEK AT HOME OFF WORK. I WAS TOLD THAT THE SILICONE IMPLANT HAD BROKEN IN MY CHEST WALL AND IT HAD TO BE CLEANED AND WASHED OUT. IN 2008, MY HEALTH STARTED A FAST DETERIORATION. DURING THE NEXT FEW YEARS MY GP DOCTOR BEGAN TO RUN VARIOUS TESTS ON ME AND SAW A PATTERN. I WAS HAVING IMMUNE SYSTEM PROBLEMS, AND MANY TESTS THAT HAD BEEN OK BEGAN TO BE OFF NORMAL. HE KNEW THAT I HAD THAT NEW BREAST IMPLANT AFTER THE FIRST ONE RUPTURED. WHEN THE ANA LUPUS TEST WAS POSITIVE AND SEVERAL RELATED TESTS WERE BAD, HE TOLD ME HE THOUGHT I SHOULD SEE A RHEUMATOLOGIST. BOTH DOCTORS TOLD ME TO HAVE THE IMPLANT REMOVED. I WENT TO SEE MY PLASTIC SURGEON ONLY TO FIND OUT HE WAS MOVING TO ANOTHER STATE AND SEMI-RETIRING. HE ALSO SAID AFTER MY SURGERY HE NO LONGER WORKED WITH SILICONE IMPLANTS. HE INTRODUCED ME TO A NEW PLASTIC SURGEON WHO TAUGHT AT THE MEDICAL SCHOOL. I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH HER TO SEE IF SHE WOULD REMOVE MY IMPLANT AND TOLD HER ABOUT MY MEDICAL PROBLEMS. SHE SAID THERE WAS NO HARD EVIDENCE THAT BREAST IMPLANTS CAUSED THEM AND CONVINCED ME I SHOULD THINK ABOUT HOW MY BODY WOULD LOOK WITHOUT THE IMPLANT. I WENT HOME AND TRIED TO DEAL WITH MY HEALTH PROBLEMS, AND SAW MY RHEUMATOLOGIST. MY TESTS WERE GETTING WORSE, I BARELY WALKED WITH A CANE, MY EYES AND GUMS WERE INFECTED, MY JOINTS WERE INFLAMED, MY HAIR WAS FALLING OUT AND MY SKIN WAS PUFFY. HE TOLD ME I NEEDED TO GET THE IMPLANT TAKEN OUT SOON BECAUSE EVEN A LITTLE BIT OF SILICONE LIKE THE COVER OF THE IMPLANT WOULD WORSEN THE AUTOIMMUNE RESPONSE OF MY BODY. I WENT BACK TO THE NEW PLASTIC SURGEON, BUT THIS TIME I SHOWED HER I SHOWED HER MY OFFICIAL HOSPITAL SURGERY REPORTS. AFTER SHE SAW THEM, SHE LOOKED UP SOME MORE ABOUT IT AND FOUND THAT MY FIRST IMPLANT WAS SO BADLY RUPTURED THAT THE SURGEONS COULDN'T GET ALL OF IT AND EVEN THE BACK PORTION OF THE FIRST IMPLANT WAS STILL STUCK TO MY CHEST WALL OVER MY HEART. SHE EXPLAINED HOW DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE TO GET THAT OUT, BUT SHE COMPLETELY CHANGED HER MIND ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE RUPTURE AND SILICONE ON MY HEALTH. SHE PRESCRIBED A BREAST SURGEON AND AN MRI, WHICH SHOWED SILICONE MIGRATED ALL OVER MY MID, LEFT, AND SIDE TORSO AND THE WHOLE BACK OF THE IMPLANT WAS STUCK TO MY RIBS, AND THE SALINE CAPSULE HAD RUPTURED. MY IMMUNE SYSTEM HAD BUILT A SCAR TISSUE WALL AROUND IT TRYING TO GET RID OF IT ALL. LONG STORY SHORT: I HAD A SIX HOUR SURGERY (B)(6) 2012 WITH TWO SURGEONS AND TWO RESIDENT PS'S, FOR AN EXPLANTATION AND MASTECTOMY OF MY RIGHT BREAST. THEY CLEANED OFF ALL THE SILICONE THEY COULD FIND INCLUDING THE BACK PIECE OF THE IMPLANT OVER MY HEART. MY PS WAS SMILING WHEN SHE CAME IN TO TELL ME THE GOOD NEWS. I DON'T THINK SHE WILL EVER TELL ANOTHER WOMAN THAT THERE IS NO CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SILICONE IMPLANT AND HEALTH CONCERNS. MY HEALTH STARTED IMPROVING IMMEDIATELY BUT NOT THE OSTEOPOROSIS IN MY HIPS NOR MY JOINTS. I'VE HAD BOTH HIPS REPLACED AND STILL HAD ANA POSITIVE TESTS. I'M TOLD I HAD THE SILICONE IN MY SYSTEM TOO LONG. I LOST MORE THAN TEN YEARS OF A ONCE HEALTHY LIFE TO SILICONE POISONING. PS: I WAS NEVER COMPENSATED IN ANY WAY FOR THE BROKEN IMPLANTS AND WAS NOT AWARE OF ANY CLASS ACTION SUITS.|BECKER PROSTHESIS AND SALINE IMPLANT||08/10/2015||||*|R||I|FWM|0.0||BECKER PROSTHESIS AND SALINE IMPLANT|||||||MENTOR|||||||True

A YEAR AND A HALF AFTER MY PROCEDURE MY HEALTH BEGAN TO DECLINE.

WHILE MY STOMACH SYMPTOMS SUBSIDED DUE TO DIET CHANGE I CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE CHRONIC DIARRHEA AND CONSTIPATION. TEST FOR CROHN'S AND ULCERATIVE COLITIS WAS NEGATIVE. I BEGAN EXPERIENCING CHRONIC FATIGUE. IN EARLY (B)(6) OF 2015 I BECAME VERY ILL: MY SYMPTOMS WERE AS FOLLOWS; EXTREME FATIGUE, EYE PAIN, EYE BURNING, PHOTOPHOBIA, HEADACHE, BODY ACHES, BACK PAIN (UPPER AND LOWER), NECK PAIN, NAUSEA, LOSS OF APPETITE, WEIGHT GAIN THAT LASTED UNTIL (B)(6) OF 2016. IN (B)(6) I HAD AN AUTOIMMUNE PANEL. MY ELISA ANA WAS POSITIVE AND SO WAS MY ANTI-CLQ IGG. HOWEVER, SLE, RHEUMATOID FACTOR, ENA, ANTI-PHOSPHOLIPID, AND ANTI-THYROID WERE ALL NEGATIVE. IN NOVEMBER 2015 I ALSO SAW AN OPHTHALMOLOGIST WHO DID NOT SEE ANY INFLAMMATION IN THE EYE BUT DID SUGGEST SICCA. IN JANUARY, WHILE MY SYMPTOMS HAD SUBSIDED SLIGHTLY BUT NOT COMPLETELY, I SAW A NEUROLOGIST FOR HEADACHES. A MRI WAS ORDERED AND RESULTS WERE NORMAL, BUT HE SUGGESTED MY SYMPTOMS WERE RHEUMATOLOGICAL. A RHEUMATOLOGIST ORDERED A MRI AND X-RAYS OF MY UPPER AND LOWER BACK. I WAS ALSO TESTED FOR HLA-B27 WHICH CAME BACK POSITIVE. THERE WERE NO RADIOGRAPHIC CHANGES, HOWEVER, BASED ON MY CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND POSITIVE TEST FOR HLA-B27 I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS. I WAS PRESCRIBED CELECOXIB WHICH IMPROVED MY BACK PAIN BUT DID NOT IMPROVE MY OTHER SYMPTOMS. I AM CURRENTLY BEING TESTED FOR LYME DISEASE AND RECHECKING MY THYROID LEVELS. I CURRENTLY HAVE OVER 20 SYMPTOMS WHICH ARE AS FOLLOWS: DRY EYE/HAIR/SKIN, HAIR LOSS, EAR RINGING, EYE PAIN, HEADACHE, HEART PALPITATIONS, INSOMNIA, ITCHING UNDER RIGHT IMPLANT, LOWER/UPPER BACK PAIN, NECK PAIN, MOUTH SORES, MUSCLE PAIN, MUSCLE TWITCHING, CHEST PAIN, COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION, CONSTIPATION, NIGHT SWEATS, PHOTOPHOBIA, SKIN RASH (ONCE ON FOREHEAD), JOINT PAIN, EKG WAS NORMAL.
