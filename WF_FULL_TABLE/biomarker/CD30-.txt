SPECIMEN (A) HAD APPROXIMATELY 17 ML OF YELLOW TO STRAW COLORED, WATERY FLUID WITH TISSUE FREE-FLOATING THROUGHOUT. SPECIMEN (B) HAD APPROXIMATELY 10CC OF YELLOW STRAW-COLORED FLUID WITH TISSUE FREE-FLOATING THROUGHOUT. DIAGNOSIS: SPECIMEN (A) CYTOLOGY RIGHT BREAST -CD30-POSITIVE MALIGNANT NEOPLASM. THE CYTOSPIN AND SECTION OF THE CELL BLOCK SHOW SHEETS OF LARGE MALIGNANT CELLS WITH LARGE VESICULAR NUCLEI CONTAINING PUNCTATE TO PROMINENT NUCLEOLI AND MODERATE AMOUNTS OF EOSINOPHILIC CYTOPLASM. HALLMARK CELLS ARE IDENTIFIED. A BATTERY OF IMMUNOPEROXIDASE STRAINS IS OBTAINED IN ORDER TO FURTHER CHARACTERIZE THESE CELLS WITH THE FOLLOWING RESULTS. POSITIVE CD30 THE FINDINGS ARE THOS OF CD30-POSITIVE MALIGNANT NEOPLASM.
