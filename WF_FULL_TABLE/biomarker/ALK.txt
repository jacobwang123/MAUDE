I GREW UP VERY ATHLETIC, SO THIS WAS LIKE DYING. TOWARD THE END OF THE 12 YEARS, I WAS NOT ABLE TO BE ON MY FEET FOR LONG AND NOT ABLE TO WALK OR RUN, OTHER THAN GROCERY SHOPPING AND THE DUTIES OF BEING A MOM. MY EYES WERE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE TO LIGHT AND I HAD TO WEAR SUNGLASSES AT MY DAUGHTER'S BASKETBALL GAME.

I HAD MANY HEADACHES AND SO MUCH BRAIN FOG THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO DO MY JOB AS AN ACTOR WHO IS SUPPOSED TO MEMORIZE LINES. I SURVIVED BY USING LISTS IN EVERYDAY LIFE. I HAD SO MUCH PAIN THAT IT HURT JUST TO BE ALIVE. MY BODY ACHED ON A DAILY BASIS. ANY TIME I USED ANY JOINT, WHETHER IT WAS MY WRIST ON MY SHOULDER, IT WOULD HURT FOR THE NEXT 5 DAYS. MY FEET WERE CONSTANTLY SORE AND I HAD TO REPLACE MY ARCH SUPPORTS EVERY 30-60 DAYS BECAUSE IT WAS LIKE WALKING ON BONES, MY FOOT DOCTOR SAID MY BOTTOMS OF MY FEET WERE THE THINNEST HE HAD EVER SEEN. I HAD SO MUCH TISSUE AND MUSCLE WASTING AND WEIGHT LOSS. I WENT FROM A (B)(6) MUSCULAR ATHLETIC WOMAN TO A (B)(6) FRAIL WOMAN WHO WAS MALNOURISHED BECAUSE HER BODY NO LONGER HAD THE ABILITY TO ABSORB NUTRIENTS.

THEY HAVE MANY ALLERGIES AND SENSITIVITIES AND HAVE SIMILAR REACTIONS TO THINGS THAT I HAVE REACTIONS TO. THEIR REACTIONS MIMIC MINE SO I KNOW THAT HEAVY METALS AND CHEMICALS HAVE BEEN PASSED THROUGH TO THEM IN UTERO AND WHILE BREASTFEEDING I LOST A LOT OF MY EYELASHES TOWARD THE END, AND MY HAIR THINNED. I HAD FEVER AND CHILLS A LOT TOWARD THE END, AND NIGHT SWEATS. I HAD TO PEE MULTIPLE TIMES DURING THE NIGHT AND ALWAYS FELT THIRSTY. I LOST THE ABILITY TO DIGEST MEAT PROPERLY, AND HAD TO EAT MOSTLY FRUITS, VEGGIES AND BEANS. LIFE BECAME SO DIFFICULT AT TIMES THAT I BECAME SEVERELY DEPRESSED AT ONE POINT. I LOST MY HOPE UNTIL I REALIZED THAT THE ROOT OF ALL OF MY PROBLEMS STARTED WHEN I GOT BREAST IMPLANTS. AS SOON AS I GOT THEM OUT, A YEAR AGO, THE COLOR RETURNED TO MY FACE AND THE JOINT PAIN MOSTLY DISAPPEARED. MY BRAIN FOG IS NEARLY GONE NOW, AND I NO LONGER NEED DAILY NAPS. I AM SLOWLY WORKING BACK INTO EXERCISING AND MY EYES ARE MUCH LESS SENSITIVE TO LIGHT. MY SKIN WAS AGING RAPIDLY THE LAST YEAR, AND NOW THAT THE IMPLANTS ARE OUT, THE AGE SPOTS HAVE LIGHTENED AND I HAVE BEEN COMPLEMENTED ON MY GLOWING SKIN AGAIN.

6386903|69480688|D|1||ONE OF THE FIRST SIGNS THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WAS IN EARLY (B)(6) 2009. I WAS HOSPITALIZED FOR RAPID HEART RATE AND LOW BLOOD PRESSURE. I WAS LATER DIAGNOSED WITH POSTURAL ORTHOSTATIC TACHYCARDIA SYNDROME AND PLACED ON METOPROLOL. I WAS ABLE TO RETURN TO A MOSTLY NORMAL LIFE, ALTHOUGH THE SYMPTOMS NEVER WENT AWAY. FROM THAT TIME ON, I DEVELOPED MORE AND MORE SYMPTOMS THAT PILED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER. THEY RANGED FROM FAIRLY BENIGN TO INCREASINGLY MORE SERIOUS AND PROBLEMATIC. I SUFFERED BOUTS OF VERTIGO; A RASH THAT LEFT PAINFUL SORES, RINGING IN MY EARS, BALANCE ISSUES, BLADDER AND KIDNEY ISSUES, A DIAGNOSIS OF INTERSTITIAL CYSTITIS, MEMORY AND COGNITIVE PROBLEMS, FOOD SENSITIVITIES AND DEBILITATING DIGESTIVE ISSUES, CONSTANT NAUSEA, NEUROLOGICAL ISSUES, TUNNEL VISION, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, HEART PALPITATIONS, DEBILITATING WEAKNESS AND FATIGUE. I GREW INCREASINGLY WEAKER AND MORE ILL. I WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO WORK AND WAS PLACED ON DISABILITY. I BEGAN USING A CANE, THEN A WALKER, AND EVENTUALLY HAD TO BE PUSHED IN A WHEELCHAIR. NO ONE HAD ANY ANSWERS FOR ME. ONE WEEKEND IN EARLY 2014, I TOOK A SEVERE TURN FOR THE WORSE. I COULD NO LONGER GET OUT OF BED AND HAD TO HAVE ASSISTANCE BATHING AND DRESSING. I HAPPENED TO NOTICE THAT ONE OF MY BREAST IMPLANTS (FROM BREAST CANCER IN 2000) HAD GONE FLAT. WE BEGAN TO WONDER IF MY ILLNESS COULD HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH MY IMPLANTS. MY HUSBAND BEGAN TO RESEARCH THAT POSSIBLE RELATIONSHIP. IN (B)(6) 2014, BOTH RUPTURED IMPLANTS, DAMAGED LYMPH NODES, AFFECTED CHEST MUSCLE, AND SURROUNDING TISSUE (TO MY CHEST WALL) WERE REMOVED DURING A 7 HOUR SURGERY. OVER THE PAST 3 YEARS I HAVE SLOWLY BEGUN TO IMPROVE. I CAN WALK SHORT DISTANCES WITH THE USE OF A CANE; I STILL HAVE TO USE AN ELECTRIC SCOOTER OR BE PUSHED IN A WHEELCHAIR IF I HAVE TO STAND FOR LONG OR GO VERY FAR. I STILL HAVE MOST SYMPTOMS, BUT MANY HAVE IMPROVED AT LEAST SLIGHTLY. I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO RETURN TO THE JOB THAT I LOVED. I USED TO BE AN ACTIVE, SOCIAL, HAPPY, HARD-WORKING PERSON. NOW I RARELY LEAVE MY HOUSE - NEVER WITHOUT ASSISTANCE. BESIDES DEVELOPING MULTIPLE FOOD SENSITIVITIES, I HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED AN EXTREME SENSITIVITY TO MOLD AND CHEMICAL EXPOSURE. I FEEL LIKE A VIRTUAL SHELL OF THE PERSON THAT I ONCE WAS. I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING TO HAVE MY LIFE BACK.

6575692|75546313|D|1||MY SITUATION WAS AS SUCH: IN (B)(6) 2015 AFTER BEING DIAGNOSED WITH DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS) FOR A THIRD TIME IN 12 YEARS, I HAD A MASTECTOMY WITH IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION ON MY RIGHT SIDE, WITH A MENTOR GEL-FILLED IMPLANT. WITHIN TWO MONTHS OF MY OPERATION, I HAD AN ODD PERSPIRATION ODOR WHICH REMAINED WITH ME PERMANENTLY. IN THE SPRING OF 2016, I BEGAN FEELING TIRED AFTER MY GYM WORKOUTS, QUITE UNUSUAL AS I HAD ALWAYS EXERCISED REGULARLY, AND I WAS IN PERFECT HEALTH. BY (B)(6) 2016, I BEGAN EXPERIENCING TINGLING AND NUMBNESS IN MY FINGERS, WHICH WAS NOT GOING AWAY. I THEN BEGAN TO HAVE SWOLLEN FINGERS, HANDS AND WRISTS IN (B)(6) OF THE SAME YEAR, WHICH LED TO MY BEING DIAGNOSED WITH CARPEL TUNNEL SYNDROME BY A RHEUMATOLOGIST. THE RHEUMATOLOGIST TOOK BLOOD TESTS AND RESULTS SHOWED I HAD AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE KNOWN AS SCLERODERMA. I WAS SHOCKED AS NOTHING LIKE THIS WAS EVER HEARD OF IN MY FAMILY. I COME FROM A LONG LINE OF HEALTHY PEOPLE WHO MOSTLY LIVE INTO THEIR NINETIES. BY THIS TIME, TOO, I BEGAN FEELING MALAISE, AND I THEN WAS WEAKENED TO THE POINT OF BEING UNABLE TO WALK UNAIDED. FROM THE MIDDLE OF (B)(6)(THE DATE MY PLASTIC SURGEON EXPLANTED THE IMPLANT), I BECAME SO DEBILITATED THAT I COULD NO LONGER WALK. I LOST 20LBS OF MUSCLE DURING THIS ABOVE-NOTED PERIOD, AS MY ARM, LEG AND REAR MUSCLES ATROPHIED, RESULTING IN ME BEING TOTALLY DEBILITATED. I WAS IN EXTREME PAIN, AND I BEGAN LOSING MY HAIR. I COULDNÂ¿T THINK CLEARLY, AND I COULD NOT SLEEP. I SUFFERED FROM EXTREME FATIGUE, AND MY JOINTS WERE SWOLLEN, ESPECIALLY MY RIGHT KNEE. I HAD UPPER BACK AND NECK WEAKNESS. I COULD NOT RAISE MY ARMS, MOVE MY LEGS OR USE MY HANDS. ALL SYMPTOMS STARTED ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF MY BODY, AND WERE MORE SEVERE THAN ON THE LEFT SIDE OF MY BODY. WHEN I TOLD THE RHEUMATOLOGIST ON (B)(6), THAT I HAD AN IMPLANT AND THAT I HAD MADE AN APPOINTMENT TO SEE MY PLASTIC SURGEON THE VERY NEXT DAY SHE SAID, Â¿YOU ARE RIGHT TO MENTION THIS TO ME. AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES ARE OFTEN CAUSED BY EXTERNAL REASONS, AND ARE NOT ALWAYS HEREDITARY.Â¿ IN THIS WAY, SHE CONFIRMED THAT IT COULD BE BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESS THAT I WAS SUFFERING FROM. THE NEXT DAY, MY PLASTIC SURGEON AGREED TO EXPLANT MY MENTOR GEL-FILLED IMPLANT STATING THAT HE COULD NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE IMPLANT WAS CAUSING MY DEBILITATION AND THAT I MIGHT NOT REGAIN MY HEALTH. THE SURGERY WAS ON A THURSDAY MORNING, AND I NEEDED A WHEELCHAIR BY THIS TIME. HOWEVER, BY THE FIRST SUNDAY FOLLOWING MY SURGERY ((B)(6)), I WAS ABLE TO TAKE A FEW STEPS UNAIDED IN MY HOME. TWO WEEKS LATER, I WAS APPROVED BY MY MEDICAL INSURANCE COMPANY TO RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING ASSISTANCE IN MY HOME; PHYSICAL THERAPY, OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY, A PERSONAL AIDE, A NURSE AND A SOCIAL WORKER. I WAS ABLE TO HAVE A VISITING NUN COME ONCE A WEEK ALSO. IT IS NOW (B)(6) 2017 AND I AM ABLE TO WALK AGAIN. I WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE SERVICES FROM THE OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST AND THE SOCIAL WORKER. MY PHYSICAL THERAPIST TOLD ME I MUST MAINTAIN AN EXERCISE PROGRAM THAT HE PRESCRIBED FOR ME. MY PERSONAL AIDE AND THE NURSE HAVE STOPPED COMING NOW AS I AM FINALLY SHOWING SIGNS OF RECOVERY. I CONTINUE TO HAVE SWELLING IN MY HANDS AND WEAKNESS IN MY UPPER ARMS, NECK AND BACK. IT IS QUITE DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT THE MENTOR GEL-FILLED IMPLANT WAS LEECHING OR BLEEDING TOXINS INTO MY BODY TO THE EXTENT THAT I WAS TOTALLY DEBILITATED FOR OVER 10 MONTHS OF MY LIFE. I THANK THE RHEUMATOLOGIST FOR VALIDATING THE FACT THAT THE IMPLANT COULD BE THE CAUSE. I HAVE BEEN ON A DETOX DIET SINCE (B)(6) 2016. I WAS UNABLE TO LEAVE MY HOUSE UNAIDED FROM (B)(6) DUE TO THIS ILLNESS. I ONLY LEFT THE HOUSE FOR DOCTOR APPOINTMENTS. I COULD NOT TAKE MYSELF TO THESE APPOINTMENTS. AT PRESENT, I CANNOT SIT FOR LONG, TIRE EASILY AND CANNOT DRIVE FAR. MY UPPER BODY MUSCLES ACHE, AND I CONTINUE TO HAVE DIFFICULTY SLEEPING.

227612|125510|D|1||PT HAS BILATERAL SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS IN 1978. IN JAN. OF THIS YR THE PT HAD HER ANNUAL MAMMOGRAM WHICH WAS MORE DIFFICULT THAN USUAL AND LEFT HER WITH EXTENSIVE BRUISING AND SWELLING IN THE RT. BREAST. A F/U MAMMOGRAM REVEALED A RUPTURE OF THE RT IMPLANT. THE PT WAS TAKEN TO SURGERY AND THE RT IMPLANT WAS FOUND TO BE HEAVILY CALCIFIED WITH A VERY CRUNCHY TEXTURE AND COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF CHALKY FLUID WITH BITS OF CALCIUM FLECKS EXTRUDED FROM THE CAPSULAR OPENING. THE IMPLANT WAS FOUND TO HAVE A RUPTURE IN THE UPPER OUTER QUADRANT WHICH WAS DEMONSTRATED ON THE MAMMOGRAM. THE WALL OF THE IMPLANT WAS ESSENTIALLY DISINTEGRATING AND HAD VERY LITTLE INTEGRITY ACCOUNTING FOR THE PROBABLE SILICONE LEAKING. THE LT IMPLANT REVEALED A BROWN SEROUS FLUID WHICH WAS WITHIN THE CAPSULE AND A CAPSULAR SEROMA HAD FORMED. THE IMPLANT WAS FOUND ALSO TO BE PARTIALLY RUPTURED WITH THE WALL DISINTEGRATING. THERE WAS ALSO A TANNISH PEEL THAT WAS WITHIN THE IMPLANT ITSELF THAT WAS FUNGATING OUTWARD AND THE PEEL WAS EVIDENT ON THE INTERIOR SURFACE OF THE CAPSULE.

226781|18473741|D|1||"RPTR WRITES, ""AFTER HAVING MY DAUGHTER IN 6/70 I HAD PROBLEMS WITH BOTH MY BREASTS. AFTER HAVING MY SECOND DAUGHTER IN 7/71, PROBLEMS I HAD WITH BOTH MY BREASTS WERE GETTING WORSE. HAVING BEEN SEEN BY MY GENERAL PRACTITIONER, I WAS SENT FOR SCAN ON BOTH BREASTS. FIBROCYSTIC MASTITIS WAS DIAGNOSED, AND I ALSO HAD GREEN FLUID OOZING FROM BOTH NIPPLES ACCOMPANIED WITH SEVERE PAIN. THE TREATMENT I WAS ON WAS DANAZOL, BUT TO NO AVAIL. I SAW MY GENERAL PRACTITIONER AGAIN WHO THEN MADE ME AN APPOINTMENT TO SEE BREAST SURGEON. I HAD NO FURTHER SCANS THAT REVEALED I HAD FIBROCYSTIC MASTITIS; BY THAT TIME FLUID FROM BOTH MY NIPPLES HAD BECOME EMERALD GREEN COLOR, REALLY DARK GREEN, ALSO WITH PAIN BECOMING WORSE. I WAS TOLD TO WRAP HOT WATER BOTTLE IN TOWEL AND PLACE TO MY BREAST; AND I WAS GIVEN PAIN CONTROL DRUGS. I STOOD PAIN UNTIL I COULD NO MORE. IN 6/90, I SAW BREAST SURGEON AGAIN, ASKING HIM IF THERE WAS WAY HE COULD RELIEVE ME FROM TERRIBLE PAIN I WAS IN. I WAS TOLD THAT THERE COULD ONLY BE ONE SOLUTION, AND THAT WAS TO HAVE DOUBLE MASTECTOMY. HE WOULD ONLY DO IT IF I WAS TO HAVE SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. I AGREED. I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE. IN 8/89 I HAD BILATERAL ""MAMMADOCHECTOMY."" THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT EITHER, SO THAT'S WHY I ASKED FOR MASTECTOMY. I SAW BREAST SURGEON WHO REFERRED ME TO PLASTIC SURGEON, AND OPERATION WAS A JOINT ONE. THE BREAST WAS REMOVED, AND BREAST TISSUE DOWN TO MUSCLE (SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY); AND IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION WITH SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. THIS WAS CARRIED OUT IN 1990. I HAD BILATERAL SUBCUTANEOUS MASTECTOMY DEEP DOWN TO PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE, IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS IN 1990. THE IMPLANTS BECAME EXPOSED DUE TO SCARS GAPING OPEN, FLUID WAS OOZING OUT. SWABS TAKEN OF FLUID REVEALED AFTER CULTURED PLASMA (KLEBSIELLA AEROGENES). I WAS GIVEN IV 500 MG METRONIDAZOLE, TETRACYCLINE/FLUCLOXACILLIN/PAIN KILLERS TYLOX. I HAD BLOOD TRANSFUSION AND IMPLANTS REMOVED FOLLOWING DAY. I WAS TOLD WHAT HAPPENED WAS JUST A ONE IN A MILLION CHANCE OF EVER HAPPENING, AND THAT I COULD HAVE SECOND ATTEMPT OF BEING REINSERTED WITH THE BREAST IMPLANTS AFTER 8 MOS. I TOOK SURGEON'S OFFER, AND HAD SECOND ATTEMPT OF HAVING SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLANTS. AGAIN IN 1991 I HAD INSERTION OF BREAST IMPLANTS YET AGAIN. IN 1992 I ALSO HAD TO HAVE THEM REMOVED DUE TO SYSTEMIC INFECTION. IN 1997, I CAME ACROSS THE PACKAGE INSERT AND PRODUCT DATA SHEET, CLEARLY STATING THAT MASTITIS OR ANY ACTIVE INFECTION IS CONTRAINDICATED TO USE OF BREAST IMPLANTS MADE FROM SILICONE GEL. I AM SO ILL WITH FIBRO-FATTY CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDER, ACCOMPANIED WITH SEVERE PAIN, PROMINENTLY MARKED VASCULARITY, FIBROMYALGIA, CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME, HYPOTHYROIDISM, PLANTAR FASCIITIS, ARTHRITIS IN KNEES, HANDS AND BACK. I EXPERIENCE NOW SEVERE PAIN IN HANDS, FINGERS, ARMS, THIGHS, BUTTOCKS CHEEKS, HIPS, AND CALVES OF BOTH LEGS. I HAVE LOSS OF BALANCE, LOSS OF WORDS, CONCENTRATION PROBLEMS, DRY EYES, MOUTH, NOSE AND VAGINA. I ALSO HAVE A LOT OF INFECTIONS, BREATHING DIFFICULTY, BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS, THRUSH IN MOUTH/VAGINA, CHEST INFECTIONS, THROAT INFECTIONS, EAR INFECTIONS, BOWEL DISORDER, AND BLADDER PROBLEMS. I HAVE WIDESPREAD PAPILLOMAS, CHEST THROUGH ARMS AND NECK. I HAVE FIBROS TISSUE IN MY JOINTS. I ALSO HAVE PAIN IN MY HEAD; IT IS NOT A HEADACHE, IT IS LIKE WHEN INFECTION AND PUSS THROB LIKE PAIN. LOSS OF SLEEP, DROPPING THINGS, BUMPING INTO THINGS, ELECTRIC SHOCK - LIKE WHEN YOU TOUCH BARE WIRES ON ELECTRICAL GOODS, IF I TOUCH ANYTHING METAL. CRAWLING SENSATION IF I TOUCH NYLON, DRYLON, LEATHER OR POLYESTER; IF I USE TALC PERFUMED AND COLORED SOAP. I ALSO HAVE FOOD ALLERGIES. DUE TO HAVING BACTERIAL INFECTIONS I STILL EVEN TODAY TAKE METRONIDAZOLE, ANTIBIOTICS, AND ANTIFUNGAL MEDICATION TOO. I FEEL VERY WEAK, I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING CHRONIC FLU-LIKE SYMPTOMS, BUT I DON'T HAVE THE FLU. I CAN ONLY STAND, EVEN WALK SHORT PACES BEFORE BECOMING EXHAUSTED, AND MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE SEVERE PAIN I SUFFER FROM. I'M IN MY EARLY 40'S, BUT AT THIS MOMENT I FEEL LIKE 90, AND IT ISN'T RIGHT. DOCTORS I'M UNDER DON'T KNOW HOW TO BEGIN TO TREAT ME. HOWEVER, THEY KNOW WHAT CAUSE IS BUT AT THIS MOMENT CANNOT OFFER ANY KIND OF TREATMENT. I AM A TEST CASE OVER HERE OF THE DOCTORS WHO ARE DEALING WITH ME. LET'S HOPE SOMETHING CAN BE DONE PRETTY SOON. I DO BLAME SURGEONS FOR THEIR IGNORANCE AND STUPIDITY OF WAY THEY HAVE TREATED ME IN THE FIRST PLACE. TO BEGIN WITH, FOR IGNORING THE PRODUCT DATA SHEETS OF ALL BREAST IMPLANTS, ALONG WITH IGNORING THE PACKAGE INSERTS TOO. I HAVE LOST ALL TRUST AND FAITH IN MEDICAL PROFESSION. THE GOVERNMENT: FOR REFUSING TO CARRY OUT ANY KIND OF RESEARCH OR TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE LIKE ME WITH SAME ILLNESS; TREATMENT WE NEED SO DESPERATELY TO GET WELL. I KNOW I'M AS TOUGH AS NAILS. I DON'T INTEND TO SIT BACK AND DO NOTHING. I'M DETERMINED TO GET SOMEWHERE AND GET TREATMENT I SO DESPERATELY NEED. UP UNTIL 1989 I USED TO WORK FULL TIME, 16 HRS A DAY IN A CUTLERY FACTORY. I ALSO TOOK CARE OF MY MOM WHO DIED FROM TERMINAL CANCER BACK IN 1985. I ALSO TOOK CARE OF MY FATHER WHO ALSO DIED FROM A TERMINAL DISEASE. BOTH OF MY PARENTS DIED FROM CHEST ILLNESSES, MOST OF MY FATHER'S FAMILY DIED FROM TUBERCULOSIS, LUNG CANCER, HEART ATTACKS, AND STROKES. IN MY MOM'S FAMILY THEY DIED OF LUNG/BREAST CANCER ETHACENIA. THEY ALL WENT TO OPEN AIR SCHOOL. I WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS BORN IN PERFECT HEALTH, THAT IS UNTIL I MARRIED AND HAD CHILDREN AT THE AGE OF 16."" HISTORY: PT SUFFERED FROM CHRONIC BREAST PAIN FOR A PERIOD OF APPROX 20 YRS AND WHICH WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CYSTIC MASTITIS. VARIOUS CONSERVATIVE, DRUG TREATMENT REGIMES WERE TRIED TO HELP HER WITH THIS PROBLEM BUT TO NO AVAIL. SHE DESCRIBES HAVING A COLORED DISCHARGE COMING FROM HER NIPPLES IN ADDITION TO THE PAIN. SHE CAME UNDER THE CARE OF A CONSULTANT GENERAL SURGEON WHO PERFORMED AN OPERATION ON HER BREAST DUCTS IN 1989.

404770|270334|D|1||"PURE MEDICAL HEALTH PROBLEM, CAUSED BY A DUBIOUS MEDICAL DEVICE, WHICH MADE VICTIMS OF RPTR'S FAMILY AND RPTR. CHILDREN NEVER HAD A REAL PARENT, SPOUSE NEVER A SPOUSE. AFTER A CHRONIC BREAST INFECTION, RPTR GOT BREAST IMPLANTS ADVISED. SO, THEY COULD ""AT LEAST"" WEAR A BRA. RPTR REALLY LOVED THAT IDEA. SURGEON TOLD RPTR: ""WHEN YOU DIE AT, SAY 80, YOUR BREASTS WILL BE STAYING STRAIGHT AHEAD. NO BREAST PROBLEMS ANYMORE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE"". IT TURNED OUT TO BE A GREAT DISASTER. RPTR HAD 18 SURGERIES. PROSTHESIS IN/OUT, IN/OUT, TRANSPLANTATION OF OWN TISSUE (WITHOUT SUCCESS), ANOTHER RECONSTRUCTION-TRY, PROSTHESIS IN/OUT, ETC. WITHIN 3 YEARS, RPTR GOT RHEUMATISM (R.A.) DIAGNOSED (WAS FORCED TO MOVE INTO A SPECIAL HOUSE FOR DISABLED PEOPLE) AND A LOT OF OTHER DISEASES WHICH DIDN'T FIT THEM AT ALL. THEIR BODY TOLD ANOTHER TALE, SO EVERYTHING WAS ALL IN THEIR MIND. IN 1990 A RUPTURED IMPLANT WAS REMOVED AND A ""VERY SAFE"" THICK ONE RE-IMPLANTED. SPECIALIST ASSURED RPTR THAT THIS NEW DEVICE DIDN'T CAUSE PROBLEMS. RPTR RECOVERED, COULD WALK WITHOUT PAIN (MIRACLE). ALAS ONLY FOR 2 MOS. THE NEW (LOW BLEED) IMPLANT STARTED TO POISON RPTR'S BODY AGAIN AND MADE THEM SICK AS NEVER BEFORE. RPTR WAS COMPLETELY DISABLED AND HELPLESS. THE ONLY WAY TO SURVIVE WAS A RADICAL EXPLANTATION OF THIS SICK-MAKER, A VERY HARD DECISION. DURING THAT TIME RPTR LAID HANDS ON AN INTERESTING MEDICAL REPORT (PUBLICIZED IN 1987) ABOUT THE POSSIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN SILICONE AND IMMUNE DISORDERS LIKE RHEUMATISM, NAMED H.A.D., ILUMAN ADJUVANT DISEASE. RPTR COULD NOT AND STILL CANNOT FIND WORDS TO EXPRESS THEIR FEELINGS OF ANGER AND BETRAYAL. ALL THOSE LOST YEARS. ALL THIS PAIN, SCARS, DESPAIR. NOT ONLY FOR THEMSELF, ALSO FOR THEIR SPOUSE AND CHILDREN. BEFORE RPTR REALIZED IT THEY WERE THE ""HEAD OF A FAST GROWING SUPPORT GROUP FOR WOMEN WITH SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS, OFFICIALLY REGISTERED BY LAW 5/7/92. RPTR'S BODY LOOKED AWFUL; ONE BREAST WAS COMPLETELY GONE. SINCE RPTR STARTED THEIR CRUSADE THEY HAVE HEARD THE VERY SAME STORY OVER 4,000 TIMES. THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR RPTR. CONTACTED OTHER GROUPS AROUND THE WORLD, ONLY ""THE TONGUE"" WAS DIFFERENT, THE TALE THE VERY SAME. RPTR ALSO WROTE OR PHONED TO DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES ALL OVER THE WORLD TO INFORM THEMSELF AS WELL AS POSSIBLE. PLASTIC SURGEONS HARDLY INFORM THE WOMEN ABOUT POSSIBLE FUTURE HEALTH RISKS BOTH TO THEMSELVES AND THEIR YET UNBORN BABIES. THEY ONLY SHOW NICE PICTURES. ""SILICONE IS AN INERT MATERIAL, NO DANGER AT ALL! THE WORLDWIDE COMMOTION IS GOSSIP FROM HYSTERICAL WOMEN, OUT FOR MONEY. NOTHING SCIENTIFIC PROVEN, NO LINK IS FOUND TILL NOW, AS LONG AS IT ISN'T BANNED I GO ON!"", IS THEIR FAVORITE SLOGAN, IT IS POSSIBLE HERE TO BUY YOUR BREASTS NOW AND PAY MONTHLY, YOU CAN READ THAT IN ALL ADS IN ALL NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES. I THINK THAT IS A VERY HYPOCRITICAL WAY TO TRANSLATE THE OATH OF HYPOCRATIS, THE MAMMON ABOVE THE HUMAN BEINGS. SINCE THE START OF SUPPORT GROUP IN 1992 TILL NOW RPTR HAS ANSWERED OVER 20,000 TELEPHONE-CALLS (FROM 5 MINS TO 1 1/2 HRS OR EVEN MORE) AND HEARD MORE THAN 4,000 TIMES THE VERY SAME STORY, SOMETIMES ANONYMOUS. THEY ALL RECEIVED INFORMATION-PACKET TO HELP THEM TO FIND THEIR WAY. GROUP ALSO SENT THE WOMEN DIFFERENT QUESTIONNAIRES FOR MORE INVESTIGATION. THE FIRST ONE WITH ABOUT 100 ANSWER POSSIBILITIES. AGE OF THE WOMEN BETWEEN 17-78 YEARS. AGE OF IMPLANTS: ONE MONTH-35 YEARS. THE RESULTS WERE SHOCKING, BUT NOT SCIENTIFIC, THAT CAME LATER THANKS TO THE UNIVERSITY WHO ANALYZED ALL RESULTS. THE MOST SHOCKING PART, THE ANSWERS FROM MOTHERS WITH CHILDREN BEFORE AND AFTER THEIR IMPLANTS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE KIDS AND THEIR MEDICAL COMPLAINTS. OVER 199 CHILDREN ARE REGISTERED. FINDINGS WERE THE VERY SAME AS WRITTEN IN A CHILDREN HOSPITAL REPORT (1993). 83% OF THE WOMEN WHO CONTACTED SUPPORT GROUP DID HAVE MANY OF THE WELL-KNOWN DISEASES. THAT IS OVER 10% OF THE VALUED 30,000 WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS IN RTPR'S COUNTRY. 14% WANTED INFO ABOUT AUGMENTATION OR RECONSTRUCTION. 2% DID NOT (YET) HAVE PROBLEMS. 1% WAS SUFFERING DUE TO OTHER MEDICAL DEVICES LIKE HIPS, TESTICLES, INJECTIONS, NEEDLES, ETC. OF THOSE 83% IS THE SCORE 99% WITH MUSCLE/JOINT PAINS, OFTEN FALSELY DIAGNOSED AS R.A. OR FIBROMYALGIA. CHRONIC FATIGUE: 98%. MEMORY LOSS, SHORT MEMORY AND BAD CONCENTRATION: 93%. MOST OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS (1487, ALL DOCUMENTED) SCORED HIGHER THAN 70%. BY EXPLANATION OVER 80% OF THE IMPLANTS WERE RUPTURED OR VISIBLY LEAKING/BLEEDING. THAT IS WHAT THE WOMEN TOLD RPTR, BUT MOSTLY NOT WRITTEN IN THEIR FILES NOR REGISTERED. 40% OF THE EXPLANTED WOMEN RECOVERED QUITE A LOT WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR. ABOUT 45% NEEDED 2 TO 5 YEARS TO FEEL BETTER. THE OTHERS, ALAS, HAVE PASSED THE WAY OF NO RETURN. NO IDEA HOW LONG THEY'LL STAY AMONG THEM. 15-20 LADIES ARE TERRIBLY SICK, GOING DOWN HILL DAILY, SOME ARE TERMINAL BY NOW. 7 TIMES THEY FOUND A TUMOR TOO LATE (AS FAR AS RPTR HAS HEARD). 16 LADIES ALREADY DIED, WITHOUT KNOWING WHY. FIVE OF THEM RPTR KNEW VERY WELL, ALMOST TILL THE VERY LAST MINUTE. ONE COMMITTED SUICIDE, 34 YEARS OLD. THEY COULD NOT STAND THE PAIN ANYMORE AND THEIR MAIMED BODY. BUT MOST OF THE IMPLANTS WERE RUPTURED (ENVELOPE GONE) OR THERE WAS VISIBLE BLEEDING. THERE ARE ALSO 2 BABIES RPTR KNOWS ABOUT. ONE CHOKED IN MUCUS AFTER BEING BREASTFED, ONLY 6 WEEKS OLD. THE OTHER ONE BLED TO DEATH, 2 WEEKS BEFORE BIRTH. NO REASON FOUND. ONLY A STRANGE DISORDER IN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. HEALTH GOVERNMENT DOESN'T TAKE ALL COMPLAINTS SERIOUSLY; THEY DON'T REALIZE THE REALITY IS EVEN MORE THAN WORSE. THEY HARDLY LISTEN TO RPTR. THEY EVEN DON'T BELIEVE RPTR AND DO NOTHING FOR THE SICK WOMEN, CHILDREN AND MEN. NO MEDICATION, NO TREATMENT, NO HELP AT ALL FOR THIS BETRAYED POPULATION. RPTR THINKS ALL THEIR HEALTH MINISTERS ARE RESPONSIBLE. THEY ALLOW DUBIOUS MEDICAL DEVICES ON THE MARKETS; THE VERY SAME DEVICE THAT IS BANNED IN AMERICA AND OTHER COUNTRIES SINCE 1992."|SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT|NI|07/10/2002|*|||*||393767.0|*|FTR|1.0||LOW BLEED SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT|Y|NI|UNK||UNK|*|UNK|||||NI|NI|True

THEY ALL TOLD PT THAT SOMETHING WAS INFLAMING THEIR NASAL PASSAGES. THEY TOLD PT THAT IF PT DIDN'T FIND OUT WHAT THEIR BODY WAS REACTING TO, THEY COULDN'T HELP PT. PT WENT TO AN ALLERGIST AND HE FOUND NO ALLERGIES. PT TOLD THEIR SPOUSE MANY TIMES THAT THEY FELT LIKE THEY WERE BEING POISONED. PT HAD THE HOUSE CHECKED FOR ANY TOXINS. SPOUSE CHECKED THE VEHICLES. BY NOW, THEY WERE FEELING MUCH WORSE. THEY FELT DIZZY AND NAUSEATED OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, PT WENT TO MANY DRS. PT WENT TO OTHER FACILITY AND THEY TOLD PT THEIR ILLNESS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THEIR IMPLANTS. PT WENT TO ANOTHER FACILITY AND THEY BOTH TOLD PT THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THEM. PT FOUND ALL THE DRS THAT THEY WENT TO, HEDGING AROUND THE SILICONE SUBJECT. IT WAS LIKE THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. SO THEY JUST SENT PT ON THEIR WAY. PT WAS BECOMING SO VERY FRUSTRATED AND ALONE. THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS PT BECAME SO ILL THEY ARE ALMOST BEDRIDDEN. THEIR NASAL PASSAGES BURN ALL THE TIME AND THEIR HEADACHES ARE CONSTANT. PT CAN HARDLY WALK AS THEIR LEGS AND FEET SWELL AND THEY ACHE ALL OVER. PT IS DIZZY AND NAUSEATED. PT HAS LOST MUCH OF THEIR SHORT-TERM MEMORY. PT HAS DEVELOPED AN IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT. PT FEELS ELECTRIC JOLTS SHOOTING THROUGH THEIR BRAIN. SOME TIMES THEY FEEL LIKE THEY WILL PASS OUT. THEY SWEAT SO BADLY DAY AND NIGHT THAT THEY HAVE TO CHANGE BEDDING AND CLOTHES CONSTANTLY. OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THEY HAVE BECOME INTOLERANT OF MOST CHEMICALS. THEY CAN'T CONSUME OR BREATH ANY CHEMICAL WITHOUT BECOMING EXTREMELY ILL. IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR, THEY FINALLY DECIDED THEY WERE GOING TO DIE IF THEY DIDN'T DO SOMETHING. THE DRS WERE NOT ABLE TO HELP PT. THEY EITHER WEREN'T ABLE TO OR WERE UNWILLING, DUE TO THEIR LACK OF THE PROPER FACTS. DUE TO THE CHEMICAL REACTION, PT DECIDED ON THEIR OWN THAT IT WAS THE SILICONE. PT DOSEN'T CARE HOW MANY DRS TOLD THEM IT WASN'T THE SILICONE. PT KNOWS IT IS. IN AUGUST OF THIS YEAR PT WENT TO A VERY GOOD PLASTIC SURGEON AND SHE TOOK THE IMPLANTS OUT. SHE FOUND THE LEFT IMPANT RUPTURED. SHE SAID THERE WAS VERY LITTLE SILICONE ACTUALLY LEFT IN THE CASE. THE SILICONE HAD MIGRATED DOWN INTO PT'S CHEST AND INTO PT'S LYMPH NODES. THEY DESCRIBED IT AS ""A STICKY MESS"". SHE ALSO REMOVED THE LYMPH NODES WITH SILICONE IN THEM. AT THAT TIME SHE TOLD PT ""THERE WAS PROBABLY SILICONE IN THEIR LIVER, LUNGS AND BRAIN"". THE RIGHT IMPLANT WAS INTACT. PT HAS NO IDEA HOW LONG THE LEFT IMPLANT HAD BEEN RUPTURED. SINCE PT IS DISABLED AND ON MEDICARE, PT HAD TO PAY FOR THE EXPLANTATION. SPOUSE HAD TO TAKE OFF FROM WORK TO TAKE PT AND THEY LOST 10 DAYS OF WORK. IT COSTS THEM $15,000 FOR THE SURGERY, GAS, MOTELS AND LOSS OF SPOUSE'S WAGES. FAMILY USED THEIR SAVING TO PAY FOR THE SURGERY AND TRIP EXPENSES. PT FEELS THEY HAVE LOST THE LAST 13 YEARS OF THEIR LIFE. IF THE DR HAD NOT TOLD PT THEIR ILLNESS WAS NOT CAUSED BY THE SILICONE IMPLANTS, PT WOULD HAVE HAD THEM OUT MANY YEARS AGO AND COULD HAVE SAVED MUCH MORE OF THEIR HEALTH. IT TAKES MANY YEARS TO TEST TO SEE IF A PRODUCT IS SAFE. PT FEELS MANY OF US HAVE BEEN THE GUINEA PIGS. AND PT FEELS IT IS PROVEN THAT SILICONE IS NOT SAFE. IT'S TOO LATE TO DO MUCH FOR PEOPLE LIKE PT, BUT LET'S PLEASE SAVE THE NEXT GENERATION. THERE ARE SO MANY WOMEN OUT HERE SUFFERING IN SILENCE AND FEELING LOST, HELPLESS AND BETRAYED. PLEASE DO ANYTHING YOU CAN TO STOP THE PEOPLE FROM BRINGING THEIR PRESCRIPTIONS BACK FROM CANADA BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID THE DRUGS WEREN'T SAFE. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE CLAIMING TO BE ILL FROM THAT? PT FEELS NO ONE SEEMS TO CARE THAT SILICONE IS POISONING WOMEN BY THE THOUSANDS."|MCGHAN|*|09/13/2003|V|||Y||476585.0|0HP|FTR|1.0||SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS|Y|CY6259|*||*|*|MCGHAN|||||*|NO. 25-45361|True

PT HAD SALINE IMPLANTS IN 2001 AND UNTIL THAT DATE PT WAS A HEALTHY, ENERGIZED, AND ACTIVE. PT HAS HAD IMPLANTS PLACED ON 2 OCCASIONS. THE FIRST TIME WAS BECAUSE FROM WHAT THE DR SAID IT APPEARED TO BE HAVING WHAT HE CALLED ""A SLOW LEAK"" WHICH LATER TURNED OUT TO BE WRONG, HE JUST PUT THE WRONG SIZE IN. THEN THE SECOND TIME WAS TO CORRECT THE CAPSULE AND SIZE DIFFERENCE. CAPSULED AFTER THEY WERE REPLACED AGAIN WHICH THE DR APPARENTLY CORRECTED WITH MASSAGES. HOWEVER, IT HAS BEEN OVER A YEAR SINCE THE LAST SET WERE REPLACED AND PT JUST DOESN'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN ANYMORE FOR ADVICE.

COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT THIS DEBILITATION IS A ""HIDDEN"" SIDE EFFECT TO THE SALINE IMPLANTS THAT NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT. PT IS GOING TO VISIT A DR IN THE NEXT 2 WEEKS WHICH THEY BELIEVE WILL RUN SOME KIND OF TOXIC REPORT TO SEE IF THE IMPLANTS ARE TO BLAME FOR THIS.

HE TOLD PT THAT THE SALINES WERE COMPLETELY SAFE AND IN THE ""VERY RARE"" CHANCE THAT THE IMPLANTS WOULD LEAK OR BREAK THAT THE SALT WATER WOULD BE HARMLESSLY ABSORBED INTO BODY. IN 2/1996 PT WENT FOR THEIR FIRST CONSULTATION WITH THE PLASTIC SURGEON. THE ONLY OTHER COMPLICATIONS THAT HE DISCUSSED WITH PT WERE THE NORMAL RISKS WITH SURGERY, INFECTION AND ANESTHESIA PROBLEMS. WHEN PT GOT THE PAPERWORK TO SIGN WITH NUMEROUS OTHER WARNINGS ON IT PT ASKED QUESTIONS AND WAS ASSURED THAT THOSE WERE ONLY BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE SILICONE -- NOT SALINE. THE OPERATION WAS SCHEDUELD. NINE MONTHS LATER HE SCHEDULED PT FOR ANOTHER OPERATION AS PT HAD DEVELOPED CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE. THEY BOTH HAD TO BE REMOVED AND REINSERTED. WITH IN A FEW HOURS ONE OF PT'S IMPLANTS HAD COMPLETELY DEFLATED. PT WAS VERY SCARED AND CALLED THEIR PLASTIC SURGEON'S EMERGENCY SERVICE. PT WAS BACK IN FOR SURGERY TO HAVE THE IMPLANT REPLACED. APPARENTLY THE VALVE HAD FAILED AND LEAKED. HE SAID THAT THIS WAS VERY RARE. SHORTLY AFTER THIS PT STARTED HAVING A LOT OF HEADACHES. PT WAS TREATED FOR MIGRAINES AND ALLERGIES. THEN PT STARTED GETTING SEVERE CRAMPING AND MUSCLE SPASMS IN NECK AND SHOULDERS AND HAD TO BE PUT ON MUSCLE RELAXERS. HEALTH GOT WORSE AND WORSE AND PT WAS VERY MUCH IN PAIN MOST OF THE TIME AND EXTREMELY STRESSED OUT. PT SAW NUMEROUS DRS AND WAS TREATED WITH ANTI-DEPRESSANTS AS THEY FELT THE ANXIETY WAS CAUSED BY THE CHRONIC PAIN. EVERY FLU OR VIRUS THAT COMES ALONG, PT GETS IT. THE HEADACHES WERE GETTING WORSE AND PT STARTED SEEING NEUROLOGISTS AND CHIROPRACTORS AND MASSAGE THERAPISTS, AND FINALLY A PAIN MANAGEMENT DR AS A LAST RESORT. THANKFULLY, PT DID MENTION IMPLANTS. HE THEN ASKED IF PT HAD EVER HAD A LEAK. PT STARTED RESEARCHING AND BECAME EXTREMELY TERRIFIED AFTER FINDING SEVERAL DIFFERENT WEB SITES WITH OTHER WOMEN'S BREAST IMPLANT HORROR STORIES. AFTER DOING A LOT OF SOUL SEARCHING AND RESEARCH PT DECIDED TO HAVE THEM REMOVED. PT WENT BACK TO IMPLANTING PLASTIC SURGEON TO ASK HIM TO DO IT. PT MENTIONED ALL OF THE INFO FOUND OUT AND TOLD HIM. THEY DID NOT WANT TO RISK HEALTH ANYMORE. HIS ATTITUDE COMPLETELY CHANGED AT THIS POINT. HE SAID THAT PT NEEDED TO WAIT ANOTHER 6 MONTHS AS HE WAS SURE THAT PT WOULD CHANGE THEIR MIND. PT SAID THAT THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF THEM CHANGING THEIR MIND BUT HE WOULDN'T LISTEN. PT TOLD HIM THAT THEY WERE SCARED AND WOULD GLADLY PAY FOR THE OPERATION. PT WASN'T ASKING FOR A FREEBIE. HE TREATED PT HORRIBLY SAYING THAT PT NEEDED TO BE TESTED FOR CANCER AND OTHER DISEASES AS ILLNESSES WERE PROBABLY FROM ONE OF THOSE AND HE COULDN'T OPERATE IF PT HAD CANCER. PT ASSURED HIM SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE CONVERSATION THAT THEY WOULD HAVE ALL OF THE TESTS PERFORMED THAT HE FELT NECESSARY TO RULE THOSE OUT FIRST. AT THIS POINT IN HIS OFFICE PT STARTED CRYING AND BEGGING HIM TO PLEASE PUT THEM ON HIS SCHEDULE AS HE IS PRETTY BOOKED ALL OF THE TIME AND IN THE MEANTIME PT WOULD HAVE ALL OF THE TESTING DONE HE NEEDED. HE WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM WHILE PT WAS TALKING TO HIM. PT HAD ANOTHER APPOINTMENT WITH A DIFFERENT DR. UPON SEEING HIM HE AGREED TO REMOVE THEM BASED ON PT'S FINDINGS AND SCHEDULED OPERATION.

IN 2003 HER SURGEON DISCOVERED A LEFT BREAST LUMP ON MRI CONSISTENT WITH IMPLANT RUPTURE. THE SURGEON WOULD REMOVE THE IMPLANT, ONLY IF CONSUMER WOULD HAVE IT (THE IMPLANT) REPLACED. SHE WAS FORCED TO SELL HER HOME IN ORDER TO HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR THE REMOVAL OF IMPLANTS WITHOUT REPLACEMENT. THIS REQUIRED AN EMERGENCY EVACUATION TO ANOTHER CITY. THE EVACUATION, ACCORDING TO THE CONSUMER WAS REQUIRED BECAUSE SHE BECAME EXTREMELY ILL. THE IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED IN 2006 AND SHE FEELS THAT ALL HER MEDICAL PROBLEMS WERE FROM SEEPAGE OF THEIR (THE IMPLANT'S) CONTENTS INTO HER BODY. THESE MEDICAL PROBLEMS INCLUDE: DIMINISHED BRAIN FUNCTION, DEPRESSION, GRANULES IN THE EYES, FIBROMYALGIA, FATIGUE, SCALP SORES, RASH AND MORE. SHE NEVER KNEW ABOUT THE PRODUCT'S RECALL, SINCE HER SURGEON WASN'T ABLE TO CONTACT HER AS HER HUSBAND'S CAREER KEPT THEM TRAVELING.

1192244|15010491|D|1||"I AM WRITING TODAY TO LET YOU KNOW, THAT I WAS DAMAGED BY MENTOR BREAST IMPLANTS. I WILL TRY TO MAKE THIS SHORT AND TO THE POINT. I AM A WIFE AND MOTHER. TWENTY YEARS AGO, I GOT MY 1ST IMPLANTS (SILICONE). AFTER A FEW YEARS I GOT A ""CAPSULE"" AND LIVED WITH IT UNTIL THE FOLLOWING FIVE YEARS. AT THAT POINT, I WENT TO DR AND HAD THEM REPLACED WITH ANOTHER SET OF SILICONE IMPLANTS. I FEEL THAT HE DID A VERY GOOD JOB AND WAS HAPPY WITH THEM FOR ALMOST 10 YEARS. IN 2004, I STARTED FEELING SICK, IN MANY WAYS AND MY IMPLANTS FELT DIFFERENT TO ME. I FELT STRONGLY THAT ONE OR BOTH HAD BURST BUT BECAUSE OF LACK OF FUNDS I WAS UNABLE TO FIND OUT OR HAVE THEM REPLACED. EVER SINCE THE SPRING/SUMMER OF 2004, I ""MYSTERIOUSLY"" DEVELOPED VITILIGO (A VERY RARE DISEASE. ESPECIALLY IN CAUCASIANS). I ALSO CAME DOWN WITH INFECTION AFTER INFECTION, AFTER INFECTION, WITH NO BREAKS. MY DOCTORS RAN COUNTLESS TESTS AND COULD NOT FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING. I WAS TESTED FOR AIDS, HIV, LUPUS, STRESS ECO, ULTRA SOUNDS, THYROID, ETC... TOO MANY TO NOTE HERE. I WOULD GLADLY GIVE YOU PERMISSION TO TALK TO MY DOCTOR WHO HAS YET TO FIGURE OUT WHY I WAS BEING PLAGUED WITH ALL THIS ILLNESS. I ALSO CAME DOWN WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AT THAT SAME TIME. I WAS CONSTANTLY EXHAUSTED AND TORTURED BY MY ILLNESSES AND NOT KNOWING WHY. I WAS ON MANY ANTIBIOTICS EVERY 2-3 WEEKS, MOSTLY CIPRO, FROM 2004-2006. THE DEPRESSION I HAVE SUFFERED AND TIME LOST COULD NEVER BE REPLACED OR PAID FOR. IN 2006, I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO AFFORD TO HAVE THEM REPLACED BY DR. WHEN I EXPRESSED TO HIM THAT I FELT MY IMPLANTS HAD RUPTURED AND CAUSED MY ILLNESS HE SUDDENLY REFUSED TO DO MY SURGERY. HIS PARTNER DR AGREED TO DO THE SURGERY AND AFTER THE SURGERY ADMITTED THAT THE LONGEST AND MOST DIFFICULT PART OF THE SURGERY WAS REMOVING LARGE AMOUNTS OF SILICONE FROM MY BODY. HIS EXACT WORDS WERE THAT ""IT WAS A MESS."" THE DAY I LEFT HIS OFFICE THAT DAY, I HAVEN'T HAD ANYMORE INFECTIONS. HOWEVER, THE VITILIGO REMAINS AND IS GETTING WORSE. I BELIEVE THAT REGARDING THAT, THE DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE AND CANNOT BE REVERSED. I FEEL MUCH BETTER SINCE THEY WERE REMOVED AND REPLACED. ALMOST A YEAR AFTER MY SURGERY, I CALLED FOR A CHECK UP, TO MAKE SURE THEY LOOKED RIGHT AND WERE AS THEY SHOULD BE. ONE DAY AFTER THAT I RECEIVED A CALL FROM DR'S OFFICE AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD FORGOTTEN TO HAVE ME SIGN A CONSENT FORM BEFORE MY SURGERY (ALMOST A YEAR BEFORE) AND THAT THEY WERE SENDING IT TO ME IN THE MAIL TO SIGN AND SEND BACK TO THEM. THE FORM WAS FOR MY CONSENT TO HAVE MENTOR IMPLANTS PUT IN MY BODY AND BE PART OF THEIR STUDY. I NEVER RECEIVED OR SAW THIS PRIOR TO MY SURGERY. IF I HAD SEEN THAT IT WAS THE SAME COMPANY, THAT I STRONGLY BELIEVE, MADE ME SICK, I MAY HAVE CHOSEN ANOTHER OPTION. I WAS NOT GIVEN A CHOICE AND I AM NOW ""PART OF A STUDY"". AS I MENTIONED ABOVE, I'M SURE I'LL NEVER RECEIVE ANY COMPENSATION FOR MY SUFFERING BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW MY STORY TO ADD IT TO THE OTHER CASES OF PEOPLE WHO STRONGLY FEEL (KNOW) THEY WERE DAMAGED BY MENTORS' BREAST IMPLANTS."|MENTOR BREAST IMPLANTS||10/09/2008|V|||||1234597.0|0|FTR|1.0||NONE|N||||||nan|||||||True

I HAD A 2 HOUR CONSULTATION WITH HER AND SHE WENT THROUGH MY WHOLE MEDICAL HISTORY AND SAID GET THE IMPLANTS OUT; YOU WERE HEALTHY UP TILL YOU HAD THEM. NO ONE EVER SAID THEY DO NOT LAST IN FACT, I WAS LED TO BELIEVE THEY LAST FOREVER, WHAT A JOKE, THESE ALMOST KILLED ME. I HAVE A 20 YEAR HISTORY OF NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS WITH THIS DISEASE THAT NO DOCTORS WANT TO ADMIT TO. WELL I HAD THE IMPLANTS REMOVED (B)(6) 2010 AND I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DETOX. MY ALTERNATIVE DOCTOR DID TOXIC TESTS, I HAVE VERY ELEVATED LEVELS OF MERCURY, LEAD, CADIUM, BARIUM GADOLINIUM THEY ARE OFF THE CHARTS FOR TOXICITY. I AM GETTING A LITTLE BETTER, I CAN AT LEAST GET TO SLEEP AT NIGHT WHERE AS BEFORE, I COULD NOT BECAUSE OF THE DISCOMFORT AND PAIN. WITH CHELATION, THE HANDS ARE COMING BACK BUT ITS TOO EARLY TO KNOW THE FULL OUT-COME. I CAN STILL FEEL A COOL TINGLING RUNNING DOWN MY ARMS AND BACK OF NECK SAME AS THE FEELING I FELT IN BOTH BREASTS. I DID HAVE A MS NURSE SAY THAT SILICONE IMPLANTS CAN CAUSE AUTO-IMMUNE BUT BASICALLY MY CONVENTIONAL DOCTORS DON'T WANT TO STEP ON ANY FEET, THEY ALL KNOW EACH OTHER. I AM DISABLED AND HAVE BEEN SINCE 10 YEARS AFTER THE IMPLANTS WERE PUT IN. I LIVE ON DISABILITY MONEY WHICH IS VERY HARD TO DO, I CAN PROVE THE TOXIC TESTS AND THE PATHOLOGY REPORTS OF PLASTER YELLOW BROWN SUBSTANCE CALCIFIED MATERIAL THEY FOUND IN MY BREASTS.

I CONSULTED WITH DR (B)(6) ON (B)(6) 1988 WHO PERFORMED MY BREAST AUGMENTATION SURGERY ON (B)(6) 1988. LAST FALL, I NOTICED A CHANGE IN MY BREASTS AND BEGAN RAISING THOSE CONCERNS WITH MY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN, WHO HAS SENT ME TO A BREAST CENTER AND TO A PLASTIC SURGEON AS WELL. MY IMPLANTS HAVE RUPTURED, MAINLY BECAUSE OF THEIR AGE AND THE TYPE OF MATERIALS THAT MY IMPLANTS WERE MADE OF YEARS AGO COMPARED TO THOSE OF TODAY. EVERYTHING NOW MAKES SENSE WITH MY FAILING HEALTH, MY NERVOUS BREAKDOWN, WHERE I ONCE RAN 3 MILES IN THE MORNING AND 3 IN THE EVENING, I CAN'T EVEN WALK A BLOCK WITHOUT GASPING FOR AIR, CHRONIC COUGHING AND FATIGUE, I CAN'T WRITE TWO SENTENCES WITHOUT MY HANDS CRAMPING UP PAINFULLY, AND I HAD NONE OF THESE ISSUES BEFORE. I FOUND OUT ABOUT THE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT REGARDING BREAST IMPLANTS IN (B)(6), RIGHT BEFORE THE EXPIRATION DATE LAST YEAR. PRIOR TO THAT, I HEARD NOTHING OF IT...I HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF IT AT ALL. I HAVE NO MEANS OF HAVING MY IMPLANTS REMOVED BECAUSE I'M ON DISABILITY. I REQUESTED MY MEDICAL RECORDS FROM (B)(6) AND THEY CONTAIN ALL ASPECTS OF MY BREAST AUGMENTATION SURGERY. THE FACT THAT I RECEIVED 205CC LOW PROFILE IMPLANTS, HOW MY EYES WERE TAPED SHUT AND THAT I HAD A SHEET DRAPED FROM MY WAIST DOWN. THERE WAS A LIST OF THE ASSISTING DOCTORS AND NURSES, THE NAME OF THE ANESTHESIA USED, THE AMOUNT USED, HOW LONG I WAS SUBDUED, MY RECOVERY TIME, A LOG OF THE DOCTORS THAT MONITORED ME, BUT NEVER IS THERE LISTED IN THERE THE NAME OF THE IMPLANT THAT THE DOCTOR USED INSIDE OF ME. MY PLASTIC SURGEON LOOKED OVER THE RECORD AS WELL AND CONCURRED. HOW COULD SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN? SO THE ONLY WAY THAT I CAN FIND OUT IS TO HAVE MY IMPLANTS REMOVED. I'VE TRIED CALLING (B)(6) TO FIND OUT IF DURING THIS PARTICULAR TIME, IF THEY ONLY USED ONE TYPE OF IMPLANT MAYBE. I CAN'T GET ANY ASSISTANCE FROM THEM AT ALL. WAS THIS SOME TYPE OF STUDY? WERE WE USED FOR SOME TYPE OF SCHOOL/COURSE MAYBE? IS THIS WHY THE IMPLANTS ONLY COST (B)(6)? WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON? MY DOCTOR NEGLECTED TO PROVIDE THIS VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION IN MY MEDICAL RECORDS. I'M TOLD AT THE (B)(6) PLASTIC SURGERY CLINIC THAT THE PRACTICE THAT'S USED IS THAT THE PATIENT IS SHOWN A SELECTION OF BREAST IMPLANTS...SHE THEN CHOOSES WHICH IMPLANT SHE WISHES TO HAVE. THIS WAS NOT MY CASE. THE DOCTOR TOLD ME THAT IF I PAID (B)(6), THE SURGERY WAS FREE AND THAT THE IMPLANTS WOULD LAST A LIFETIME...I WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEMS FROM THEM AT ALL. HE IN TURN, PROVIDED NO INFORMATION ON THE TYPE OF IMPLANT THAT HE INSERTED IN MY BODY. I WAS NOT GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE...HE GAVE ME WHAT HE WANTED TO GIVE ME.

2329822|2352292|D|1||IN (B)(6) 2009, I GOT BREAST IMPLANTS BY (B)(6). SOME MONTHS AFTER THE SURGERY I STARTED GETTING PAIN IN MY LEFT KNEE. I ATTRIBUTED THE PAIN TO RUNNING AND THE YOGA I WAS PRACTICING, EVEN THOUGH I'VE BEEN DOING YOGA FOR A LONG TIME. TRIED TO CONTROL THE PAIN WITH DIFFERENT NATURAL MEDICINES AND EXERCISES TO STRENGTHEN THE KNEE WITH NO RESULTS. THIS YEAR PAIN STARTED IN MY LEFT WRIST AND TOE; THE PAIN WAS SO STRONG THAT I COULD NOT PUT ANY PRESSURE ON MY LEFT WRIST OR EVEN BEND THE TOE. AFTER TAKING OMEGA-3 FOR SOME TIME THINKING THAT THE PROBLEM WAS IN MY JOINTS THAT REQUIRED SOME LUBRICATION I DECIDED TO EXPLANT THE SALINE IMPLANTS. IT HAS BEEN ALREADY THREE WEEKS AND I CAN SAY THAT THE PAIN THAT STARTED ON MY KNEE AND PROGRESSED TO MY WRIST AND TOE ARE MUCH BETTER. THE PAIN IS STILL PRESENT BUT AT A MUCH LOWER INTENSITY. NOW I CAN BEND MY KNEE, HOLD OBJECTS WITH MY HAND AND WALK WITHOUT MAJOR PAIN. I BELIEVE THAT ONCE MY BODY CLEANSES COMPLETELY MY HEALTH WILL BE BACK TO WHAT IT WAS PRIOR TO IMPLANTS. THE ONLY PRODUCTS TAKEN WERE SOME CHINESE HERBS - THAT DID NOT WORK, OMEGA-3 AND IODINE PILLS THAT DID NOT WORK EITHER.

2358522|16921874|D|1||"I WAS IMPLANTED IN 2005 AND EXPLANTED 2 MONTHS AGO. BEFORE GETTING IMPLANTS, I ASKED MY PLASTIC SURGEON WHAT COMPLICATIONS COULD OCCUR. HE SIMPLY SAID CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR THEY COULD RUPTURE OR LEAK. AND IF THEY LEAKED, IT WOULD ONLY LEAK SALINE INTO MY BODY AND IF THE SCAR CAPSULES GOT HARD, THE DR WOULD SIMPLY TAKE THE IMPLANTS OUT. WHEN I ASKED IF MOLD, FUNGUS, OR BACTERIA COULD GROW IN MY IMPLANTS, BECAUSE IT IS IN A MOIST ENCLOSED DARK AREA JUST SITTING THERE, HE SAID ABSOLUTELY NOT! HE SAID THE REASON WAS THE WATER WILL BE IN A CLOSED, STERILE ENVIRONMENT. I ASKED MY PLASTIC SURGEON ABOUT ALL THE WOMEN WHO HAD FILED LAW SUITS WHO SAID THEY HAD IMMUNE DISORDERS ISSUES. HE SAID STUDIES HAVE FOUND THOSE WOMEN HAD PREDISPOSED MEDICAL ISSUES, AND THOSE WERE WOMEN WITH SILICONE IMPLANTS. THESE WERE SALINE, AND THEREFORE COULDN'T HARM ME. I WAS ALSO NEVER TOLD IF FOR SOME REASON I HAD TO GET MY IMPLANTS REMOVED, MY BREASTS WOULD OR COULD LOOK DEFORMED. I COULD NOT MAKE AN INFORMED CHOICE ABOUT GETTING IMPLANTS BECAUSE I WAS ONLY TOLD THE PRETTY ABOUT THE IMPLANTS: HOW IT WOULD ENHANCE MY FIGURE AND BALANCE ME OUT. IF I HAD KNOWN I COULD GET SICK, I WOULD NEVER HAVE GOTTEN THE IMPLANTS. I WAS NEVER GIVEN THE BOOKLET ON THE FDA WEB SITE, WHICH THE FDA SUPPOSEDLY REQUIRES TO BE GIVEN TO EACH PT. I WAS JUST SOLD THE BEAUTIFUL STORY OF THE GLORIFIED SALINE BREAST IMPLANT, WHICH I BOUGHT HOOK, LINE, AND SINKER. BEFORE MY IMPLANTS, I HAD RUN 3 MARATHONS, 4 HALF MARATHONS, AND MANY 5K'S. ABOUT 3 - 4 YEARS AFTER GETTING MY IMPLANTS, I GOT VERY SICK. I COULD NOT WORK OUT ANYMORE. MY HAIR WAS FALLING OUT, MEMORY ISSUES, I HAD TERRIBLE FATIGUE, AND ACHES AND PAINS IN MY KNEES, HIPS, NECK AND BACK. I WAS BLOATED, HAD FREQUENT FEVERS RESULTING IN CHILLS AND SHAKES, THROWING UP, CONSTIPATION, VAGINITIS, CANDIDA ISSUES WHICH WAS SHOWING UP IN MY BLOOD AND SINUSES. ONE OF THE SCARY THINGS THAT WOULD OCCUR WAS THAT THERE WERE TIMES MY STOMACH WAS SO INFLAMED, MY FOOD WOULD JUST SIT AND NOT DIGEST. THIS WOULD CAUSE MY HEART TO RACE AND MY BODY TO SHAKE. I WOULD HAVE TO THROW IT UP IN ORDER TO FEEL BETTER AGAIN. I MISSED A LOT OF WORK. THANK GOODNESS I WORK FOR A FABULOUS COMPANY. WHEN MY IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED, I HAD ASPERGILUS NIGER AND FUNGUS. I STILL HAVE SOME FUNGAL ISSUES, BUT I AM 80% BETTER THAN I WAS! I HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO WORK OUT FOR A YEAR AND A HALF, WHEREAS THANKS TO GOD, I CAN NOW WEIGHT TRAIN AND WORK OUT ON THE ELLIPTICAL. I HAVE SPENT (B)(6) IN THE PAST 2 YEARS ON DOCTORS, MEDICATIONS AND PROCEDURES JUST TO GET BETTER. I HAD THOUGHT MY IMPLANTATION WOULD ONLY COST (B)(6). I DON'T KNOW HOW OFTEN THESE KINDS OF HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE CAUSED BY BREAST IMPLANTS IN OTHERS, BUT GUESS WHAT, NEITHER DOES ANYONE IN THIS ROOM. THE REASON WE DON'T KNOW, IS BECAUSE THE STUDIES HAVE ASKED THE WRONG QUESTIONS. I DON'T THINK THIS IS COINCIDENTAL. I THINK WHEN IMPLANT COMPANIES AND PLASTIC SURGEONS PAY FOR OR CONDUCT STUDIES ON BREAST IMPLANTS, THEY ASK QUESTIONS WHICH MAKE IMPLANTS SEEM SAFE. I'M HERE TO SAY IT IS TIME TO FIND OUT WHAT THE REAL RISKS ARE OF BREAST IMPLANTS, INCLUDING SALINE AND SILICONE GEL IMPLANTS. MEANWHILE, EVEN IF DOCTORS THINK THE KINDS OF PROBLEMS I HAD ARE RARE, IT SHOULD BE MANDATORY FOR DOCTORS TO DISCLOSE TO POTENTIAL PTS THAT SOME WOMEN GET VERY SICK FROM THEIR IMPLANTS. WHY ISN'T THERE A WARNING LABEL ON BREAST IMPLANTS LIKE THERE ARE ON MOST EVERY OTHER DRUG OR MEDICAL PROCEDURE/SURGERY OUT THERE? I KNOW THE TRUTH, BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE AND ALSO BECAUSE I HAVE TALKED TO MANY OTHER WOMEN WITH SIMILAR EXPERIENCES WITH THEIR IMPLANTS. IT IS TIME FOR THE FDA TO REQUIRE STUDIES OF WOMEN WHO ARE SICK FROM THEIR IMPLANTS TO SEE IF THEY RECOVER WHEN THEIR IMPLANTS ARE REMOVED. ONCE I FIGURED OUT MY IMPLANTS WERE THE CAUSE OF MY SICKNESS, I JOINED A COUPLE OF ONLINE FORUMS TO SEEK OTHER WOMEN WHO WERE EXPERIENCING THE SAME THING. IT WAS AMAZING HOW MANY WOMEN ALL HAD SIMILAR REACTIONS AND HEALTH PROBLEMS -- (B)(6). THERE ARE A LOT OF US OUT THERE. MANY OF THESE WOMEN WEREN'T AS LUCKY AS I WAS, BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T AFFORD TO GET THEIR IMPLANTS REMOVED. INSTEAD, THESE LADIES ARE GETTING SICKER AND SICKER. SOME HAVE DIED, SOME HAVE ORGANS SHUTTING DOWN, MAKING THEM TOO SICK FOR SURGERY. AND SOME HAVE COMMITTED SUICIDE. I WONDER HOW MANY WOMEN HAVE COMMITTED SUICIDE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THEM AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO GET BETTER. ALMOST ALL THE WOMEN HAD SIMILAR STORIES WITH THEIR PLASTIC SURGEON DENYING BREAST IMPLANTS CAUSE SUCH PROBLEMS. THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY SO MANY WOMEN GOT SICKER AND SICKER, GOING TO DR AFTER DR TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS WRONG SINCE THEY WERE TOLD IMPLANTS WERE NOT THE CAUSE OF THEIR SYMPTOMS. I AM ASKING YOU TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, SO THAT OTHER WOMEN WON'T GO THROUGH THIS. THERE ARE DOCTORS WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO HELP THEIR IMPLANT PTS SO THEY FEED THEM ANTIDEPRESSANTS. EVEN IF WOMEN ARE TOLD THEIR IMPLANTS WILL NOT LAST A LIFETIME, THEY DON'T REALIZE THIS MEANS MANY IMPLANTS LAST ONLY 10 YEARS. AND MAMMOGRAPHY TECHS HAVE TOLD ME THEY ARE TOLD IMPLANTS ONLY LAST 5 - 6 YEARS. I PLEAD WITH YOU TO NOT IGNORE THIS GROWING EPIDEMIC OF WOMEN WITH AGING IMPLANTS AND SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS. NOT EVERYONE GETS SICK, BUT THOSE OF US WHO DO PAY DEARLY. PLEASE USE MY EXAMPLE TO ADVISE THE FDA THEY SHOULD NOT BE USING SALINE IMPLANT PTS AS A ""CONTROL GROUP"" TO STUDY THE RISKS OF SILICONE GEL BREAST IMPLANTS. THE LOCAL COMPLICATIONS ARE SIMILAR FOR ALL BREAST IMPLANTS, AND EVEN THE AUTOIMMUNE SYMPTOMS CAN BE SIMILAR. STUDIES COMPARING SILICONE PTS TO SALINE PTS MIGHT CONCLUDE THEY DON'T DIFFER, BUT IT DOES NOT MEAN EITHER TYPE OF IMPLANT IS SAFE. STUDIES SHOULD COMPARE IMPLANT PTS TO WOMEN WHO DO NOT HAVE IMPLANTS, TO FIND OUT HOW MANY ARE LIKELY TO BE SERIOUSLY HARMED AFTER 5 YEARS, 10 YEARS, OR 20 YEARS. WHAT IS TRULY SAD IS I HAVE HAD SEVERAL WOMEN CONTACT ME SINCE JUNE OF THIS YEAR WHO ARE EXTREMELY SICK FROM THEIR SILICONE AND SALINE IMPLANTS... ONE IS A STATE ATTORNEY WHO IS IN..."|INAMED/MCGHAN|25-68421|11/22/2011||||Y|||0HP|FWM|1.0||BREAST IMPLANT SALINE||68-420|||SANTA BARBARA|US|MCGHAN|93111|CA|93111||||True

1977779|1898938|D|1||I HAD SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS PUT IN (B)(6) OF 2007. ABOUT 7 MONTHS LATER, I STARTED TO EXPERIENCE: VERTIGO, HEART PALPITATIONS, MIGRAINES, RASHES, VISUAL DISTURBANCES AND PLUGGED EARS. THIS DID NOT GO AWAY! I WENT TO SEVERAL DOCTORS, HAD NUMEROUS SCANS, TONS OF BLOOD WORK DONE AND THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING. MY DOCTOR SAID I HAD ALLERGIES AND I WAS DEPRESSED. HE PUT ME ON ALLERGY MEDS. AND ANTI-DEPRESSANTS. THIS ONLY MADE ME WORSE. THEN I STARTED TO HAVE BODY PAIN FROM MY HIPS UP THAT DIDN'T GO AWAY. I WENT TO PHYSICAL THERAPY TWICE, CHANGED MY DIET, HAD MORE SCANS DONE AND AGAIN, THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING. I THOUGHT I WAS DYING! I HAD TOLD ALL THE DOCTORS (ENT, ALLERGIST, INTERNIST, CARDIOLOGIST, NEUROLOGIST, FAMILY DOCTOR) THAT I HAD IMPLANTS AND THEY ALL SAID THAT IT WASN'T FROM MY IMPLANTS. I CAN'T BELIEVE I BELIEVED THEM AND NOT MY GUT FEELING. ABOUT 2 YEARS LATER, BARELY HOLDING ON TO MY JOB, MY HUSBAND ETC., I STARTED DOING RESEARCH ON SALINE BREAST IMPLANTS. NOT ONLY DID I FIND NUMEROUS SUPPORT GROUPS WITH 100'S (I WOULD SAY THOUSANDS HAVE BEEN ON THESE SITES) OF WOMEN WHO WERE SCARED TO DEATH OF WHAT THE IMPLANTS HAVE DONE TO THEIR LIVES AND BODIES. SOME OF THEM CAN'T WORK, SOME OF THEM HAVE KILLED THEMSELVES AND SOME OF THEM HAVE JUST DIED BECAUSE OUR SOCIETY ONLY HAS A FEW SKILLED DOCTORS WHO KNOW HOW TO ADDRESS THEIR NEEDS AND THE REST OF THESE DOCTORS, WHO ARE HERE TO HELP US NOT SAY WE'RE DEPRESSED BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, SIMPLY REFUSE TO LISTEN OR DO THE RESEARCH ETC. I HAD MY IMPLANTS TAKEN OUT 5 MONTHS AGO. EVERYTHING HAS GONE AWAY EXCEPT A FEW THINGS: INFLAMMATION IN MY FRONT RIB/CHEST AREA, FATIGUE. I BELIEVE THIS IS SOME SORT OF CHONDRITIS DUE TO THE EXPLANT. I HAVE BEEN DETOXING THE TOXINS THAT WERE LEFT BEHIND FROM THE IMPLANTS AND I'M FEELING MUCH BETTER. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THE FDA CAN IGNORE ALL OF THESE WOMEN. MOST OF THEM ARE TOO SICK AND TIRED TO FIGHT BUT THIS IS BEING TALKED ABOUT MORE AND MORE. I WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN. MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS WILL NEVER VIEW THE FDA THE SAME AGAIN EITHER.

1998794|20917661|D|1||I HAVE SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS AFTER HAVING RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY FOLLOWING A BREAST CANCER BILATERAL MASTECTOMY. AT THE END OF (B)(6) 2010, I VISITED (B)(6). THE WEATHER WAS EXTREMELY COLD, -16 DEGREES IN THE EVENINGS. AS THE DRIVE INTO THE MOUNTAINS CLIMBED IN ELEVATION FROM (B)(6), I BEGAN TO HAVE SHALLOW BREATHING. I REMAINED CLAM AND KEPT MY BREATHING SLOW TO AVOID PANIC. WHEN I GOT OUT OF THE CAR, MY MOVEMENTS WERE EXTREMELY SLOW AND RESTRICTED. I FELT IT NECESSARY TO PAY ATTENTION TO MY BREATH, THE SHALLOWNESS WAS VERY PRESENT WITH HEAVINESS IN MY CHEST, AND I COULD NOT FILL MY LUNGS AS I NORMALLY COULD. THROUGHOUT THE NEXT TWO DAYS, I WAS RESTRICTED IN MOVEMENT IN THAT I COULD NOT BREATHE TO COMPLETE NORMAL DAILY TASKS. WALKING ACROSS THE ROOM CAUSED ME TO STOP AND CATCH MY BREATH. MY FAMILY AND I TREATED THIS SYMPTOM AS ALTITUDE SICKNESS. I HAVE NEVER HAD ALTITUDE SICKNESS WITH ANY PRIOR VISITS TO (B)(6). MY LAST VISIT WAS (B)(6) 2010 WITH NO SYMPTOMS WHAT SO EVER. I CONTEMPLATED, MANY TIMES, IF I SHOULD GO TO THE ER BUT KEPT FAITH IN THAT IT WOULD SUBSIDE BY DRINKING WATER AS IF IT REALLY WERE ALTITUDE SICKNESS. AS INTENSE HEADACHE DEVELOPED THAT ENVELOPED MY ENTIRE CRANIUM. I DO NOT HAVE ISSUES WITH HEADACHES, CERTAINLY NOT ONE THIS INTENSE. I FELT HANDICAPPED. I AM NOT HANDICAPPED. I AM A NORMALLY FUNCTIONING HEALTHY CAPABLE WOMAN WHOSE BREATH WAS COMPROMISED BY PRESSURE IN THE CHEST. MY IMPLANTS WERE TIGHTER THAN NORMAL, LARGER AS IF THEY WERE SWOLLEN. ON THE DRIVE BACK TO (B)(6), THERE WAS A POINT WHERE MY BREATH RETURNED TO NORMAL. IT WAS ABOUT THE SAME AREA WHERE IT WAS SHORTENED ON THE WAY UP. TO SAY I WAS RELIEVED I COULD BREATHE NORMALLY AGAIN IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. A SHORT WHILE LATER, I NOTICED A LOUD SLOSHING SOUND IN MY IMPLANTS. THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED SINCE THEY WERE PUT IN (B)(6) 2007. THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT WOULD RESULT IN A LOUD PROMINENT SLOSHING SOUND THAT COULD BE HEARD BY OTHERS IN THE ROOM. THEIR FORM REMAINED NORMAL. I COULDN'T TELL IF THE NOISE WAS COMING FROM INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF THE IMPLANT. THE SKIN AROUND THE IMPLANT SEEMED NORMAL AS WELL. I WAS UP ALL NIGHT EVALUATING IF THEY WERE LEAKING OR NOT. I FOUND IT ODD THAT THEY WOULD BOTH LEAK BUT THE NOISES CAME EQUALLY FROM BOTH SIDES. WITHIN A 24 HOUR TIME SPAN, THE NOISES WERE JUST ABOUT GONE. THERE ISN'T A DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT MY IMPLANTS REACTED TO THE INTENSE COLD AND THE ELEVATION OF THE AREA I VISITED. I CANNOT RETURN TO (B)(6) IN FEAR THIS WILL HAPPEN AGAIN.

2163607|2106125|D|1||"I'M WRITING MY STORY TO THE FDA. THIS IS ABOUT MY BREAST SILICONE IMPLANTS THAT HAVE BEEN BLEEDING OUT FOR 7 OR MORE YEARS. I STARTED TO CONTINUALLY TO BE SICK WITH SYMPTOMS LIKE: LOW GRADE FEVERS 99.6 TO 100.8 (ALL THE TIME), FATIGUE, SWOLLEN LYMPH NODES, FLU-LIKE SYMPTOMS, NIGHT SWEATS, INSOMNIA, BACKACHES, WEIGHT LOSS, WEIGHT GAIN, BONES HURTING, CANKER SORES IN MY MOUTH FOR 4 MONTHS AND ON AND OFF FOR 2 YEARS, LARGE SUB LINGUAL TONSILS, COUGHING, WEAKNESS, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, CHEST PAINS, PAIN DEEP IN THE BONES, MEMORY LOSS. UNTIL (B)(6) 2007, WHEN MY BLOOD PRESSURE WENT UP AND I STARTED GETTING CHEST PAINS, THEN I SAW MY CARDIOLOGIST. HE RAN ALL THE TESTS, ECHO, THALLIUM TREADMILL AND BP MONITOR WITH BLOOD TESTS. ALL THE TESTS CAME BACK NEGATIVE EXCEPT FOR MY CRP, IT WAS 20.6. THIS HAD MY CARDIOLOGIST CONCERNED. HE ASKED THAT I RETURNED IN 2 MONTHS FOR A REPEAT TEST TO SEE IF IT WAS STILL HIGH 20.1. IN (B)(6), THE TEST WAS REPEATED WITH THE SAME RESULT 20.1. SENT ME FOR A CHEST CT SCAN. CAME BACK ABNORMAL AGAIN. MY CT SHOWED MANY SPOTS WITH INFILTRATES IN BOTH LUNGS AND PATCHY SPOTS WITH ABNORMAL LYMPH NODES. HE REFERRED ME TO A PULMONOLOGIST; SHE SAID I NEED A LYMPH NODE BIOPSY IN MY AXILLARY'S NODES, WANTED TO R/O LYMPHOMA. SHE HAD MORE BLOOD TEST DONE AND MY CPR WAS UP TO 43 AND SED RATE WAS UP, WBC WAS UP, BLOOD WORK IS STARTING TO COME BACK ABNORMAL. SHE REFERRED ME TO A GENERAL SURGEON TO PERFORM THE BIOPSY AND THE BIOPSY CAME BACK SHOWING SILICONE IN THE LYMPH NODES AND ALSO IN MY MEDIA-STERNUM FROM THE LAST BIOPSY. THE DOCTORS ARE NOW SAYING THIS HAS BEEN LEAKING INTO SYSTEM SLOWLY SINCE BEFORE 2004 AND MY AUTOIMMUNE SYSTEM HAS BEEN FIGHTING, WHICH IS WHY I HAVE BEEN SO SICK. WELL, THE 1ST SURGERY WAS ON (B)(6) 2007. THE INCISIONS ARE ABOUT 3IN ON BOTH SIDE OF MY PELVIC AREA. THIS SURGERY WILL BE DIVIDING THE INFERIOR EPIGASTRIC BLOOD VESSELS, TRAINING THE TRAM TISSUES TO RELY ON THE SUPERIOR EPIGASTRIC SYSTEM. THIS STEP IS NOT REQUIRED FOR SUCCESSFUL PEDICLE TRAM RECONSTRUCTION BUT CAN IMPROVE BLOOD SUPPLY TO THE FLAP. SO-CALLED DELAY PROCEDURES MAY EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY OF PERFORMING MICROSURGERY (""SUPERCHARGING"") IF THE PEDICLE FLAP HAS ANY ARTERIAL OR VENOUS INSUFFICIENCY PROBLEMS, SINCE THE VESSELS DIVIDED IN THE ""DELAY"" CANNOT BE USED. IT IS INFECTING MY LUNGS AND IMMUNE SYSTEM AND OTHER MAJOR ORGANS. IN ALL I HAD A MINIMUM OF 13 MAJOR SURGERIES WHICH INCLUDE MORE RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY AND WOUND CARE, DEVELOP NECROSIS FROM THE SURGERY, ALL THE SILICONE COULD NOT BE REMOVED. I HAD DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH AND THERE IS VERY LITTLE ABOUT MY CONDITION AND SILICONE ILLNESS. BOTH THE SURGEON AND PLASTIC SURGEON HAVE SAID THIS IS A VERY RARE CONDITION. ON (B)(6) 2007, BILATERAL PEDICLES TRAM FLAP WITH THE REMOVAL OF SILICONE IMPLANTS. BOTH IMPLANTS WERE RUPTURED AND BLEEDING OUT, MORE ON THE LEFT THEN ON THE RIGHT SIDE. BUT THE PLASTIC SURGEON -PS- SAID THESE HAVE BEEN LEAKING FOR A LONG TIME. THE PS CLEANED ALL THE AREA WHILE NOT TO DISTURB THE BLOOD VESSEL FOR THE TRAM FLAPS. THE PS USED THE SKIN OF THE BREASTS FROM WHERE HE REMOVED THE IMPLANTS AND TRANSPLANTED THE FLAPS BILATERALLY TO KEEP ME THE SAME SIZE AND SYMMETRICALLY. THE ABDOMEN REPAIR ""TUMMY TUCK"". THERE HAS BEEN SOME BRUISING AROUND THE ""NEW PLACEMENT"" OF THE BELLY BUTTON AND ABDOMEN AROUND THERE. THE PS USED MESH FOR MY ABDOMEN INSTEAD OF ALLODERM, BECAUSE THE MESH WAS STRONGER. I CAN FEEL THAT MESH WHEN I WALK. I WAS IN SURGERY FOR 8 1/2 HOURS AND SUFFERED RESPIRATORY FAILURE WITH PULMONARY EDEMA WITHIN THE FIRST 24 HOURS. I WAS MOVED TO THE FLOOR AND DEVELOPED PNEUMONIA IN THE RIGHT LOWER LOBE. I SWEAR, I WAS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT BASED ON BREATHING. ANTIBIOTICS PUSH AND LASIX PUSH AND PLENTY OF RESPIRATORY THERAPY, WHEN I GOT HOME I HAD EXTRA EQUIPMENT OXYGEN, WALKER, AND HOSPITAL BED. I WAS ON A LOT OF ANTIBIOTICS AND PAIN PILLS. I WENT TO THE DOCTOR AND IT LOOKS LIKE I'M GOING TO BE ADMITTED BACK INTO THE HOSPITAL ON (B)(6) 2008 FOR MORE SURGERY FOR A WOUND THAT DEVELOPED IN THE ABDOMEN. THE SURGERY IS FOR DEBRIDEMENT OF THE WOUND THAT IS NOT HEALING AND PLACING A WOUND VAC ON IT. THE DOCTOR WILL HAVE TO REDO 8 INCHES OF THE INCISION. I WILL BE IN THE HOSPITAL FOR 2-3 DAYS; I WILL HAVE TO PRAY MORE. THE SURGERY IS SUPPOSED TO TAKE 1 TO 1 1/2 HOUR; WITH THE COMPLICATIONS OF MY LUNGS THAT TIME SHOULDN'T BE TOO BAD. I WAS AFRAID OF DEVELOPING INFECTION, (B)(6). THEN 6 WEEKS OF THE WOUND VAC ON MY ABDOMEN. I DID DEVELOP (B)(6) AND WAS HOSPITALIZE FOR 4 MONTHS IN 2008. I HAVE STARTED TO SEE THE TRANSPLANTATION TEAM TO HAVE A POSSIBLE LUNG REMOVED BEFORE I RUN OUT OF TIME. BOTH LUNGS ARE FILLED WITH SILICONE, AS WELL AS MY KIDNEYS, AND MY GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT. MY PULMONARY DOCTOR I HAVE HAS BEEN WITH ME FOR 4 YEARS, AND SHE HAS SEEN ME GET WORSE THROUGH ON-GOING TESTS AND YEARS. WITH THE LUNG BIOPSIES (B)(6) 2011, SHOWING SILICONE THROUGHOUT MY LUNGS, SHE THEN SAW MY LAST PFTS AND IT WAS WORSE BY 80% SINCE (B)(6) 2011, AND MY O2 LEVEL IS AT 7 LITERS NOW. IT HAS GONE UP BY 3 LITERS SINCE (B)(6) 2010. SO CURRENTLY, I AM GOING THROUGH THE PRE-TESTING FOR LUNG TRANSPLANTS TO SEE IF I QUALIFY FOR THE TRANSPLANTS. SO I HAVE TO GO THROUGH A LOT OF TESTING TO SEE IF MY BODY CAN HANDLE THE TRANSPLANTS. ONLY MY DOCTOR UNDERSTANDS EVERYTHING ABOUT WHAT IMPLANTS CAN DO TO YOU. SHE HAS SEEN ME GO THROUGH IT A LOT. WHEN MY IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED IN 2007, THE DOCTOR HAD TO LEAVE THE OUTER PART IN BECAUSE MY TISSUE WAS ALREADY TAKEN OVER. MY IMPLANTS HAD BEEN LEAKING UP TO 7 YEARS PER THE TIMELINE OF ALL THE ISSUE WITH MY HEALTH PER MY DOCTORS. I HOPE THE LUNG TRANSPLANTS WILL BE APPROVE TO PLACE ME ON THE ORGAN TRANSPLANT LIST. SILICONE IMPLANTS SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL MORE AND NEW UPDATED RESEARCH IS DONE. PLEASE, I BEG YOU TO LISTEN."|MENTOR||07/11/2011||12/04/2007||R|||0|FTR|1.0||BREAST IMPLANTS|||||||MENTOR|||||MENTOR||True

5039249|24514426|D|1||"I HAD BREAST AUGMENTATION IN 2007. MY IMPLANTS ARE THE GUMMY BEAR, SILICONE, UNDER THE MUSCLE. I REALLY HADN'T BEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO ANY CERTAIN SYMPTOM UNTIL IN EARLY (B)(6) 2014, I WAS EXERCISING AND NOTICED A SEVERE PAIN IN MY RIGHT CALF MUSCLE. I THOUGHT I HAD TORN MY CALF BUT AFTER A WEEK IT WENT AWAY. AS I CONTINUED TO EXERCISE I NOTICED EXTREME FATIGUE IN MY MUSCLES AND REALIZED THAT I COULD NOT LIFT MY RIGHT FOOT. SEARCHING THE INTERNET I REALIZED I HAD FOOT DROP. AT THE SAME TIME I HAD STARTED NOTICING MY MUSCLES TWITCHING. I AM AN INTERNET RESEARCHER AND WHAT I WAS FINDING WAS INCREDIBLY SCARY. IN ADDITION, MY RIGHT BREAST HAD AN EPISODE OF SWELLING AND PAIN. I SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT FOR THE BREAST. THEY DID ULTRASOUND, MAMMO, AND THEN MRI. FINDING FLUID UNDER THE IMPLANT THEY SCHEDULED A BIOPSY AND MENTIONED ALCL. DURING THE APPOINTMENT FOR THE BIOPSY THE DOC COULD NOT FIND ENOUGH FLUID TO BIOPSY AND BECAUSE THE PAIN WAS GONE HE ABORTED THE PROCEDURE. FAST FORWARD TO (B)(6) 2014, I SAW A GP FOR THE MUSCLE CRAMPS AND FOOT DROP, SHE REFERRED ME TO A NEUROLOGIST. I ASKED ALL DOCTORS IF MY IMPLANTS COULD BE (THE RADIOLOGIST FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF RUPTURE) RELATED AT ALL - ALL SAID ""OH, BUT I'M NO EXPERT."" NEUROLOGIST #1 DID A COUPLE OF TESTS OF MY BLOOD (FOR COPPER) AND AN EMG. SAID I DEFINITELY HAD WEAKNESS AND UNEXPLAINED FOOT DROP SO I ""PROBABLY HAVE ALS"", SO MY WORLD HAS COME CRASHING DOWN. WE GOT A SECOND OPINION FROM A NEUROLOGIST THAT SPECIALIZES IN ALS. UPON FIRST MEETING HE SAID IT COULD BE SO MANY THINGS. ORDERED ANOTHER EMG. THAT DOC SAID THE TEST RESULTS DID NOT SEEM CONSISTENT WITH ALS BUT BECAUSE THERE IS NO TEST FOR ALS IT WOULD BE A WAIT AND SEE SITUATION. ABOUT (B)(6) IN BLOOD TESTS LATER FOR ANY ALS MARKERS OR ANYTHING ELSE, NO CONCLUSION. ANOTHER EMG WAS DONE AT THE ""SPECIALIST'S OFFICE"" AND ONE TECH SAID SOME PARTS OF ME TESTED BETTER THAN LAST TIME AND THEN SOME AREAS LOOKED THE SAME OR ""MAYBE SLIGHTLY WORSE."" AT THIS POINT I HAD STOPPED FOCUSING ON MY BREAST BUT THE RIGHT SIDE STILL DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT. IT IS SLIGHTLY MORE RIGID. I CAN FEEL RIPPLES IN THE IMPLANT, MY NECK APPEARS SLIGHTLY SWOLLEN ON THE RIGHT. SEARCHING BACK THE LAST 8 YEARS I STARTED REALIZING THAT MY MUSCLE WEAKNESSES PROBABLY BEGAN 3-4 YEARS AGO, THE CRAMPS AT LEAST 3-4 YEARS. I'VE STRUGGLED WITH MILD FACIAL BREAK OUTS, SMELLING URINE, MORE EXTREME SYMPTOMS DURING CERTAIN DAYS OF THE MONTH, TONGUE SWELLING, ANXIETY, FATIGUE, ETC. NOT WILLING TO SIT AROUND AND DO NOTHING I AM SEEING A NATUROPATH. HE SAYS MY LYME TEST CAME BACK WITH A 50/50 CHANCE OF ME HAVING LYME. MY B12 IS LOW, MY TESTOSTERONE LEVELS ARE BARELY EXISTENT, AND ONE OTHER MICRONUTRIENT WAS LOW. I'VE SHARED ALL THIS WITH MY NEUROLOGIST AND HE SAYS THAT NONE OF THIS MEANS ANYTHING. I AM GETTING SLIGHTLY WEAKER. I WALK WITH A LIMP DUE TO THE FOOT DROP, JOINT PAIN AND BACK PAIN COME AND GO. FOOT DROP AND MUSCLE TWITCHES REMAIN. MY GUT SAYS ITS THE IMPLANTS AND I KNOW THERE IS NO TEST TO DO FOR A DEFINITIVE ANSWER. ON (B)(6) 2015 I WENT IN FOR EXPLANT. IT WAS FOUND THAT MY RIGHT IMPLANT WAS RUPTURED AND THE SILICONE HAD SPILLED OUT INTO MY TISSUES. THE DOCTOR PERFORMED AN EN BLOC CAPSULECTOMY AND REPLACED THE IMPLANTS WITH MENTOR SALINE IMPLANTS. I AM 1.5 POST EXPLANT AND I NOTICE SOME MILD CHANGES, IMPROVEMENTS. HOWEVER, MUSCLE TWITCHES AND FOOT DROP REMAIN. I HAVE FOUND A (B)(6) GROUP WITH OVER 300 WOMEN THAT ARE EXTREMELY ILL FROM THEIR IMPLANTS AND TRYING TO GET HELP AND GET HEALTHY. I BELIEVE THAT I HAVE SOME SOFT OF SILICONE POISONING THAT IS NOT DETECTED BY MEDICAL TESTS. I AM IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO DO SMALL THINGS TO DETOX, EAT HEALTHY, INFRARED SAUNA, ETC.

5004369|23148611|D|1||I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY CORRESPONDENCE FROM MENTOR ABOUT PROBLEMS OR FAULTY IMPLANTS OR ANY IMPLANT STUDY; NEITHER HAVE ANY OF MY FRIENDS WHO HAD IMPLANTS DUE TO CANCER. IN 1990 I HAD A LEFT BREAST RECONSTRUCTED AFTER A MASTECTOMY IN 1989. I HAD ONLY ONE TROUBLE-FREE YEAR WITH THE MENTOR BECKER PROSTHESIS. I COMPLAINED OFTEN TO MY PS DOCTOR THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS CAUSING SEVERE ITCHING, CHANGING SHAPE AND MAKING LUMPY SPOTS ON MY TORSO. IN 2002, I HAD XRAYS SHOWING ALL THE SALINE HAD LEAKED OUT AND THE SILICONE WAS LEAKING INTO THE BROKEN SALINE BAG. THE PS AGREED TO TAKE IT OUT, BUT WANTED TO REPLACE IT WITH A DIFFERENT KIND, A MENTOR SALINE PRODUCT. I WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A QUICK SURGERY AND GO HOME THAT DAY; INSTEAD, THE SURGERY TOOK FOUR HOURS, I SPENT SEVERAL PAINFUL DAYS IN THE HOSPITAL AND A WEEK AT HOME OFF WORK. I WAS TOLD THAT THE SILICONE IMPLANT HAD BROKEN IN MY CHEST WALL AND IT HAD TO BE CLEANED AND WASHED OUT. IN 2008, MY HEALTH STARTED A FAST DETERIORATION. DURING THE NEXT FEW YEARS MY GP DOCTOR BEGAN TO RUN VARIOUS TESTS ON ME AND SAW A PATTERN. I WAS HAVING IMMUNE SYSTEM PROBLEMS, AND MANY TESTS THAT HAD BEEN OK BEGAN TO BE OFF NORMAL. HE KNEW THAT I HAD THAT NEW BREAST IMPLANT AFTER THE FIRST ONE RUPTURED. WHEN THE ANA LUPUS TEST WAS POSITIVE AND SEVERAL RELATED TESTS WERE BAD, HE TOLD ME HE THOUGHT I SHOULD SEE A RHEUMATOLOGIST. BOTH DOCTORS TOLD ME TO HAVE THE IMPLANT REMOVED. I WENT TO SEE MY PLASTIC SURGEON ONLY TO FIND OUT HE WAS MOVING TO ANOTHER STATE AND SEMI-RETIRING. HE ALSO SAID AFTER MY SURGERY HE NO LONGER WORKED WITH SILICONE IMPLANTS. HE INTRODUCED ME TO A NEW PLASTIC SURGEON WHO TAUGHT AT THE MEDICAL SCHOOL. I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH HER TO SEE IF SHE WOULD REMOVE MY IMPLANT AND TOLD HER ABOUT MY MEDICAL PROBLEMS. SHE SAID THERE WAS NO HARD EVIDENCE THAT BREAST IMPLANTS CAUSED THEM AND CONVINCED ME I SHOULD THINK ABOUT HOW MY BODY WOULD LOOK WITHOUT THE IMPLANT. I WENT HOME AND TRIED TO DEAL WITH MY HEALTH PROBLEMS, AND SAW MY RHEUMATOLOGIST. MY TESTS WERE GETTING WORSE, I BARELY WALKED WITH A CANE, MY EYES AND GUMS WERE INFECTED, MY JOINTS WERE INFLAMED, MY HAIR WAS FALLING OUT AND MY SKIN WAS PUFFY. HE TOLD ME I NEEDED TO GET THE IMPLANT TAKEN OUT SOON BECAUSE EVEN A LITTLE BIT OF SILICONE LIKE THE COVER OF THE IMPLANT WOULD WORSEN THE AUTOIMMUNE RESPONSE OF MY BODY. I WENT BACK TO THE NEW PLASTIC SURGEON, BUT THIS TIME I SHOWED HER I SHOWED HER MY OFFICIAL HOSPITAL SURGERY REPORTS. AFTER SHE SAW THEM, SHE LOOKED UP SOME MORE ABOUT IT AND FOUND THAT MY FIRST IMPLANT WAS SO BADLY RUPTURED THAT THE SURGEONS COULDN'T GET ALL OF IT AND EVEN THE BACK PORTION OF THE FIRST IMPLANT WAS STILL STUCK TO MY CHEST WALL OVER MY HEART. SHE EXPLAINED HOW DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE TO GET THAT OUT, BUT SHE COMPLETELY CHANGED HER MIND ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE RUPTURE AND SILICONE ON MY HEALTH. SHE PRESCRIBED A BREAST SURGEON AND AN MRI, WHICH SHOWED SILICONE MIGRATED ALL OVER MY MID, LEFT, AND SIDE TORSO AND THE WHOLE BACK OF THE IMPLANT WAS STUCK TO MY RIBS, AND THE SALINE CAPSULE HAD RUPTURED. MY IMMUNE SYSTEM HAD BUILT A SCAR TISSUE WALL AROUND IT TRYING TO GET RID OF IT ALL. LONG STORY SHORT: I HAD A SIX HOUR SURGERY (B)(6) 2012 WITH TWO SURGEONS AND TWO RESIDENT PS'S, FOR AN EXPLANTATION AND MASTECTOMY OF MY RIGHT BREAST. THEY CLEANED OFF ALL THE SILICONE THEY COULD FIND INCLUDING THE BACK PIECE OF THE IMPLANT OVER MY HEART. MY PS WAS SMILING WHEN SHE CAME IN TO TELL ME THE GOOD NEWS. I DON'T THINK SHE WILL EVER TELL ANOTHER WOMAN THAT THERE IS NO CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SILICONE IMPLANT AND HEALTH CONCERNS. MY HEALTH STARTED IMPROVING IMMEDIATELY BUT NOT THE OSTEOPOROSIS IN MY HIPS NOR MY JOINTS. I'VE HAD BOTH HIPS REPLACED AND STILL HAD ANA POSITIVE TESTS. I'M TOLD I HAD THE SILICONE IN MY SYSTEM TOO LONG. I LOST MORE THAN TEN YEARS OF A ONCE HEALTHY LIFE TO SILICONE POISONING.

WOMEN WITH BREAST IMPLANTS MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL BUT INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING ALCL IN THE FLUID OR SCAR CAPSULE ADJACENT TO THE IMPLANT. ALCL HAS BEEN REPORTED GLOBALLY IN PATIENTS WITH AN IMPLANT HISTORY THAT INCLUDES ALLERGANÂ¿S AND OTHER MANUFACTURERSÂ¿ BREAST IMPLANTS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF ALCL WHEN YOU HAVE A PATIENT WITH LATE ONSET, PERSISTENT PERI-IMPLANT SEROMA. IN SOME CASES, PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OR MASSES ADJACENT TO THE BREAST IMPLANT. WHEN TESTING FOR ALCL, COLLECT FRESH SEROMA FLUID AND REPRESENTATIVE PORTIONS OF THE CAPSULE, AND SEND FOR PATHOLOGY TESTS TO RULE OUT ALCL. IF YOUR PATIENT IS DIAGNOSED WITH PERI-IMPLANT ALCL, DEVELOP AN INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLAN IN COORDINATION WITH A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES WORLDWIDE, THERE IS NO DEFINED CONSENSUS TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR PERI-IMPLANT ALCL. POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR WITH SALINE-FILLED BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY INCLUDE: REOPERATION, IMPLANT REMOVAL, HEMATOMA/SEROMA, AND NECROSIS. PUBLISHED STUDIES INDICATE THAT BREAST CANCER IS NO MORE COMMON IN WOMEN WITH IMPLANTS THAN THOSE WITHOUT IMPLANTS.

MY STORY IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT BECAUSE I HAD BREAST IMPLANTS PUT IN ON (B)(6) 2001 FOR THE FIRST TIME AND HAD THOSE IMPLANTS IN UNTIL (B)(6) 2015. THE REASON I HAD THE OLD IMPLANTS REMOVED WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE 14 YEARS OLD. I THOUGHT I WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING BY GETTING THEM REPLACED. I HAD NO IDEA THAT THEY WERE WHAT WAS MAKING ME SICK OR I WOULD HAVE NEVER HAD NEW IMPLANTS PUT BACK IN YET AGAIN. NOW, I HAVE TO HAVE SURGERY ONCE AGAIN TO EXPLANT THE NEW IMPLANTS. THE SERIAL NUMBERS FOR THE NEW IMPLANTS ARE (B)(4). ALLERGAN NATRELLE. I HAD THE SAME SURGEON IN 2001 AND 2015. AFTER MAKING AROUND SICK AS A DOG FOR THE PAST 9 YEARS, DOCTOR AFTER DOCTOR, CONSTANTLY MEDICATED, NO IDEA WHY I WAS SO SICK. I WAS BORN WITH ONLY THE TOP PART OF MY THYROID TO START. I GOT IMPLANTS AT AGE (B)(6) AND SEEMED TO DO FINE UNTIL I WAS (B)(6) AND THEN IT'S LIKE LITERALLY DEATH. I BEGAN TO GET VERY FATIGUED, CANDIDA YEAST OVERGROWTH, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, WEIGHT GAIN, EMOTIONAL INSTABILITY, MIGRAINES, MY IMMUNE SYSTEM WAS SO LOW AND I WAS CONSTANTLY GETTING SICK WITH BRONCHITIS. I WENT MISDIAGNOSED OR UNDIAGNOSED ALL TOGETHER FROM AGE (B)(6). I ACTUALLY HAD AN ENDO IN (B)(6) DO AN ULTRASOUND OF MY THYROID FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE AND HE IS THE DOCTOR THAT ADVISED ME THAT I HAD A BIRTH DEFECT AND DIAGNOSED ME WITH HYPOTHYROIDISM. SINCE GETTING THE IMPLANTS IN 2001, I HAVE GOTTEN SICKER AND SICKER. I NOW HAVE HASHIMOTO'S THYROIDITIS DISEASE AS WELL AS HYPOTHYROIDISM. I JUST RECENTLY MOVED FROM (B)(6) WHERE GOD LED ME TO DR (B)(6). DR (B)(6) HAS BEEN DIAGNOSING ME ONE THING AT A TIME AND DOING AN EXCELLENT JOB. HE IS TRYING TO GET MY MENSTRUAL PERIODS BACK ON TRACK AS THEY HAVE BEEN ALL OVER THE PLACE OR NONEXISTENT FOR THE LAST 3-5 YEARS.

5949107|54877479|D|1||I WAS ADVISED BY MY ENDOCRINOLOGIST IN (B)(6) 2016, THAT I NEED A SURGEON CONSULTATION AND SURGERY TO HAVE MY NEW SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS REMOVED, AS THEY ARE LITERALLY POISONING AND KILLING ME. MY STORY IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT BECAUSE I HAD BREAST IMPLANTS PUT IN ON (B)(6) 2001 FOR THE FIRST TIME AND HAD THOSE IMPLANTS IN UNTIL (B)(6) 2015. THE REASON I HAD THE OLD IMPLANTS REMOVED WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE 14 YEARS OLD. I THOUGHT I WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING BY GETTING THEM REPLACED. I HAD NO IDEA THAT THEY WERE WHAT WAS MAKING ME SICK OR I WOULD HAVE NEVER HAD NEW IMPLANTS PUT BACK IN YET AGAIN. NOW, I HAVE TO HAVE SURGERY ONCE AGAIN TO EXPLANT THE NEW IMPLANTS. THE SERIAL NUMBERS FOR THE NEW IMPLANTS ARE (B)(4). ALLERGAN NATRELLE. I HAD THE SAME SURGEON IN 2001 AND 2015. AFTER MAKING AROUND SICK AS A DOG FOR THE PAST 9 YEARS, DOCTOR AFTER DOCTOR, CONSTANTLY MEDICATED, NO IDEA WHY I WAS SO SICK. I WAS BORN WITH ONLY THE TOP PART OF MY THYROID TO START. I GOT IMPLANTS AT AGE (B)(6) AND SEEMED TO DO FINE UNTIL I WAS (B)(6) AND THEN IT'S LIKE LITERALLY DEATH. I BEGAN TO GET VERY FATIGUED, CANDIDA YEAST OVERGROWTH, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, WEIGHT GAIN, EMOTIONAL INSTABILITY, MIGRAINES, MY IMMUNE SYSTEM WAS SO LOW AND I WAS CONSTANTLY GETTING SICK WITH BRONCHITIS. I WENT MISDIAGNOSED OR UNDIAGNOSED ALL TOGETHER FROM AGE (B)(6). I ACTUALLY HAD AN ENDO IN (B)(6) DO AN ULTRASOUND OF MY THYROID FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE AND HE IS THE DOCTOR THAT ADVISED ME THAT I HAD A BIRTH DEFECT AND DIAGNOSED ME WITH HYPOTHYROIDISM. SINCE GETTING THE IMPLANTS IN 2001, I HAVE GOTTEN SICKER AND SICKER. I NOW HAVE HASHIMOTO'S THYROIDITIS DISEASE AS WELL AS HYPOTHYROIDISM. I JUST RECENTLY MOVED FROM (B)(6) WHERE GOD LED ME TO DR (B)(6). DR (B)(6) HAS BEEN DIAGNOSING ME ONE THING AT A TIME AND DOING AN EXCELLENT JOB.

THE ARTICLE COMMENTS OF A PATIENT WITH MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS FOLLOWING BREAST IMPLANT SURGERY THAT HAD A SUBSEQUENT AUTOPSY. THE PATIENT FIRST HAD BREAST IMPLANTS FROM AN UNKNOWN MANUFACTURER PLACED IN 1985 AND HAD UNSPECIFIED Â¿ADVERSE REACTIONS.Â¿ THEY WERE REPLACED WITH OTHER BREAST IMPLANTS FROM AN UNKNOWN MANUFACTURER IN 2001 AT WHICH TIME IT WAS FOUND THAT [THE PATIENT'S] PREVIOUS IMPLANTS WERE RUPTURED. PATIENT THEN DEVELOPED A CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE OF THE LEFT BREAST AND UNDERWENT CAPSULECTOMY. AT THAT TIME THE PATIENT ALSO COMPLAINED OF PAINFUL BREASTS, BURNING SENSATION IN THE BREASTS, LYMPH PACKAGES IN THE LEFT ARMPIT, MEMORY DYSFUNCTION, WALKING DYSFUNCTION, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, BOWEL FUNCTION PROBLEMS, SKIN DISORDER, A FEELING OF CHRONIC ILLNESS, AND LEG NUMBNESS. IN 2002 BOTH IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED. IN 2003 THE PATIENT DEVELOPED SWOLLEN LYMPH NODES IN THE LEFT AXILLA WHICH WERE REMOVED AND BIOPSIED. FROM THE HISTOLOGICAL EXAM THE LYMPH NODE REACTIONS WERE THOUGHT TO BE A REACTION TO SILICONE. THE PATIENT ALSO DEVELOPED SWOLLEN LYMPH NODES IN THE LEFT GROIN, BUT WE HAVE NO INFORMATION REGARDING SUBSEQUENT FOLLOW UP ON THOSE. IN 2004 THE PATIENT DEVELOPED INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA OF THE LEFT BREAST, HOWEVER IT MIGHT BE COINCIDENTAL AND NOT LINKED TO THE SILICONE IMPLANTS. THE PATIENT DEVELOPED MULTIPLE METASTASES AND SUBSEQUENTLY DIED OF THE DISEASE. PER THE PATIENT REQUEST, AN AUTOPSY WAS DONE LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE OF SILICONE MIGRATION ONTO OTHER ORGAN SYSTEMS. EXAMINATION WAS DONE BY LIGHT AND ELECTRON MICROSCOPY. MEASUREMENTS FOR ELEMENTAL SILICON WERE ALSO PERFORMED. SILICONE WAS FOUND IN ALMOST ALL TISSUES EXAMINED INCLUDING BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD. IT WAS CONTAINED IN THE FORM OF PLAQUES AND VACUOLES. THE PLAQUES TENDED TO ALSO INCLUDE TITANIUM. SIGNS OF CHRONIC INFLAMMATION WERE SEEN AROUND SILICONE DEPOSITS IN LYMPH NODES BUT NOT IN OTHER TISSUES. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE PATIENTÂ¿S DEVICES WERE ALLERGAN IMPLANTS.

WHEN I MENTIONED THE IMPLANTS, THEY WOULD SAY ""THEY HAVE PROVED THOSE ARE SAFE."" I FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT ON MY OWN THROUGH THE INTERNET. I CONSULTED WITH TWO DOCTORS THAT SPECIALIZE IN EXPLANT AND AMAZINGLY, THEY WERE ABLE TO TELL ME MY SYMPTOMS. IN 2014, I HAD AN EXPLANT AND LYMPH NODE DISSECTION OF SILICON INFILTRATED LYMPH NODES. I WAS TOLD THAT THOUGH MY IMPLANTS WERE INTACT, THE OUTER TEXTURED SHELL HAD BEEN FLAKING OFF. I HAD ANOTHER LYMPH NODE DISSECTION IN 2015 AND KNOW THAT I NOW ADD'L NODES WITH SILICON IN THEM NOW. ULTRASOUND WENT AWAY IMMEDIATELY POST EXPLANT AND OTHERS TOOK A COUPLE OF MONTHS, BUT I WOULD SAY THAT I AM GENERALLY ABOUT 85% BETTER. THIS WHOLE ORDEAL HAS LEFT ME WITH NO TOLERANCE FOR MOLD AND I AM NOT ABLE TO TAKE ANTIBIOTICS (WITHOUT TAKING AN ANTIFUNGAL AS WELL). THE LAST TWO YEARS HAVE BEEN A BIT OF A ROLLER COASTER. THOUGH SOMETIMES I AM OKAY, I HAVE BEEN LEFT WITH AUTO-IMMUNE ISSUES SWOLLEN JOINTS, DRY EYES, RASHES AND FATIGUE. SYMPTOMS GET WORSE WHEN EXPOSED TO ANY TYPE OF MOLD, AND BETTER WHEN ON ANTI-FUNGAL. THE IMPLANTS BASICALLY STARTED TO DISINTEGRATE IN MY BODY. IF THEY WERE NOT GOING TO LAST 20 YEARS, LIKE I WAS INITIALLY TOLD WHEN I CHOSE TO HAVE RECONSTRUCTION, I SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MENTOR OR THE FDA AND CHANGED THEIR MIND AND THIS WAS NO LONGER THE CASE. MY ADDRESS AND PHONE NUMBER FROM THE ADJUNCT STUDY ARE STILL THE SAME. NOTE I WAS TAKING NONE OF THESE OTC MEDS PRIOR TO EXPLANT."|SILTEX BECKER 50 EXPANDER/MAMMARY PROSTHESIS||07/22/2016||||Y|*||I|FTR|2.0||SILTEX BECKER 50 EXPANDER/MAMMARY PROSTHESIS||231377|||||MENTOR|||||354-2020||True

I WAS TESTED FOR PLANTARS FASCIITIS WHICH CAME BACK NEGATIVE, PHYSICAL THERAPY AND CHIROPRACTIC APPOINTMENTS BECAUSE WAS TOLD POSSIBLE NERVE PINCH IN LOWER BACK. THREE YEARS AGO THE PAIN CREPT UP INTO MY HANDS AND ARMS AND CONTINUING THROUGHOUT MY WHOLE BODY FEELING AS THOUGH SOMEONE HAD DUMPED CHEMICAL ACID ON MY BODY TO THE POINT ALL I COULD DO IS LAY IN BED AT NIGHT AND WISH I WOULD DIE. IN APPROX (B)(6) 2014, MY WHOLE BODY DECIDED TO REACT BY NOT BEING UNABLE TO REGULATE ITS BODY TEMPERATURE, EXTREME DIZZINESS TO THE POINT OF BLACKOUTS, EXTREME FATIGUE TO WHERE I BARELY COULD FUNCTION FOR A FEW HOURS THEN WOULD HAVE TO SLEEP, I FELT AS THOUGH I WAS SUFFOCATING ALL THE TIME, MY HANDS BEGAN SHAKING TO THE POINT I COULD NOT HOLD MY PHONE OR A GLASS. I COULD NOT THINK CLEARLY AND WAS HAVING EXTREME MEMORY LOSS, I WENT FROM HAVING 20/20 VISION TO NEEDING TRIFOCALS IN A MATTER OF LESS THAN A YEAR. THE PAIN IN MY BODY GOT WORSE AND NEVER LET UP. I HAVE TO KEEP MY HOME AT ABOUT 68 DEGREES BECAUSE HEAT MAKES THE CHEMICAL ACID BURNING INCREASE 10 FOLD, I HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME LEAVING MY HOME BECAUSE I LIVE IN THE DESERT AND THE SUN LITERALLY MAKES MY SKIN FEEL AS THOUGH IT IS BLISTERING. BETWEEN (B)(6) 2014 AND (B)(6) 2015 I LOST (B)(6) POUNDS UNEXPLAINABLY. ON (B)(6) 2015 MY PRIMARY PHYSICIAN WROTE ME OUT OF WORK FOR A WEEK THEN 2 WEEKS THEN FOR AN UNDETERMINED AMOUNT OF TIME AND SAID I NEEDED TO SEE A NEUROLOGIST. I FOLLOWED UP WITH A NEUROLOGIST WHO SAID HE BELIEVED I HAD PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY, BUT PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY DID NOT FIT ALL THE SYMPTOMS I WAS HAVING. AT THIS POINT I STARTED GOING TO THE (B)(6) CLINIC IN LATE (B)(6) 2015 WHO BY JUST MY SYMPTOMS FIGURED I HAD EITHER LUPUS, MS, HODGKIN'S DISEASE, LYME DISEASE OR SOME OTHER AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE. THEY PERFORMED MULTIPLE MRI'S, CAT SCANS, PET SCANS, BLOOD AND URINE TESTS, NERVE TESTS, HEART TESTS, LUNG TESTS AND MANY OTHER TESTS TO TRY AND DETERMINE WHY I WAS SICK. THEY DID DETERMINE THAT MY BLOOD PRESSURE WAS EXTREMELY LOW AND WOULD BOTTOM OUT IF I STOOD OR MOVE TOO QUICKLY CAUSING THE DIZZINESS AND BLACKOUTS. WHICH IS OPPOSITE OF WHAT I WAS 4 YEARS AGO TAKING MEDICINE FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. THEY DETERMINED I HAD EARLY STAGES OF EMPHYSEMA AND COPD. THE PET SCAN SHOWED NO TYPE OF CANCER, AND MY BLOOD WORK CAME BACK FINE OTHER THAN MY C-REACTIVE PROTEIN WAS AT 18. AT THIS POINT THEY DETERMINED I HAD AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE FOR UNK REASONS WITH SMALL FIBER NEUROPATHY. NONE OF THE MEDICATIONS OR THE INTERVENOUS STEROIDS RELIEVED MY SYMPTOMS. IN (B)(6) 2015, MY DAUGHTER DISCOVERED WHAT IS KNOWN AS BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESS. ALL THE SYMPTOMS LISTED FOR THIS WAS WHAT I WAS DEALING WITH. I HAD MY IMPLANTS REMOVED (B)(6) ENBLOCK STYLE WITH CAPSULES COMPLETELY REMOVED. SINCE THIS TIME I HAVE STEADILY FELT MY HEALTH RETURNING. SINCE SURGERY MY MEMORY HAS GOTTEN BETTER ALONG WITH WHAT I CALL THE BRAIN FOG, THE PAIN ALL OVER MY BODY HAS LESSENED TO MAYBE AN 8 INSTEAD OF A 10, THE SHAKING ONLY OCCURS ONCE IN AWHILE. I AM FAR FROM BEING BETTER, BUT I CAN TELL I AM AT LEAST RECOVERING SLOWLY.|MENTOR TEXTURED BREAST IMPLANTS||07/13/2016||||*|*||I|FWM|0.0||BREAST IMPLANTS|||||||MENTOR|||||||True
