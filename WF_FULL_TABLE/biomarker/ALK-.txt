6153187|61697756|D|1||LITERATURE ARTICLE Â¿BACTERIAL BIOFILM INFECTION DETECTED IN BREAST IMPLANT-ASSOCIATED ANAPLASTIC LARGE-CELL LYMPHOMAÂ¿ REPORTS Â¿TWENTY-SIX BREAST IMPLANTÂ¿ASSOCIATED ALCL SAMPLES WERE GATHERED FROM FOUR CENTERS FOR THIS INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIVE STUDY FROM A TOTAL OF 22 PATIENTS (TABLE 1).Â¿ ARTICLE GOES ON TO STATE: Â¿BOTH THE BREAST IMPLANTÂ¿ASSOCIATED ALCL AND NONTUMOR CAPSULE SAMPLES YIELDED HIGH MEAN NUMBERS OF BACTERIA (BREAST IMPLANTÂ¿ASSOCIATED ALCL, 4.7 Ã 106 CELLS/MG OF TISSUE; CAPSULE, 4.9 Ã 106 CELLS/MG OF TISSUE). ANALYSIS OF THE MICROBIOME IN BREAST IMPLANTÂ¿ASSOCIATED ALCL SPECIMENS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WITH SPECIES IDENTIFIED IN NONTUMOR CAPSULE SPECIMENS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER PROPORTION OF RALSTONIA SPP. PRESENT IN ALCL SPECIMENS COMPARED WITH NONTUMOR CAPSULE SPECIMENS (P < 0.05). IN CONTRAST, SIGNIFICANTLY MORE STAPHYLOCOCCUS SPP. WERE FOUND ASSOCIATED WITH NONTUMOR CAPSULE SPECIMENS COMPARED WITH BREAST IMPLANTÂ¿ASSOCIATED ALCL SPECIMENS (P < 0.001). BACTERIAL BIOFILM WAS VISUALIZED BOTH ON SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY AND FLUORESCENT IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION.Â¿ CYTOLOGICAL MARKERS ALK- AND CD30+ HAVE BEEN REPORTED. ACCORDING TO TABLE 1 Â¿CLINICAL SUMMARY OF BREAST IMPLANTÂ¿ASSOCIATED ALCL PATIENTS,Â¿ THERE WAS 1 CASE OF ALCL WHICH PRESENTED WITH BOTH EFFUSION AND TUMOR. THERE IS CURRENTLY NO WAY TO DETERMINE WHICH CASES HAD WHICH DEVICE TYPE OR TESTED NEGATIVE FOR BACTERIAL INFECTION. THIS REPORT WILL CAPTURE 1 CASE OF ALCL WHICH PRESENTED WITH BOTH EFFUSION AND TUMOR.|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|12/07/2016||||*|*||0HP|FWM|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||NI|||||UNKNOWN MANUFACTURER|||||||True
