THE OPTIMAL MANAGEMENT OF THIS DISEASE HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED. THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF DIFFERENT THERAPIES USED IN PATIENTS WITH BI-ALCL TO DETERMINE AN OPTIMAL TREATMENT APPROACH.Â¿ Â¿THE MEDIAN AND MEAN FOLLOW-UP TIMESWERE 45 AND 30 MONTHS, RESPECTIVELY (RANGE, 3 TO 217 MONTHS). THE MEDIAN OVERALL SURVIVAL (OS) TIME AFTER DIAGNOSIS OF BI-ALCL WAS 13 YEARS, AND THE OS RATE WAS 93%AND 89%AT 3 AND 5 YEARS, RESPECTIVELY. PATIENTS WITH LYMPHOMA CONFINED BY THE FIBROUS CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE IMPLANT HAD BETTER EVENT-FREE SURVIVAL (EFS) AND OS THAN DID PATIENTS WITH LYMPHOMA THAT HAD SPREAD BEYOND THE CAPSULE (P = .03). PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT A COMPLETE SURGICAL EXCISION THAT CONSISTED OF TOTAL CAPSULECTOMY WITH BREAST IMPLANT REMOVAL HAD BETTER OS(P = .022) AND EFS(P = .014) THAN DID PATIENTS WHO RECEIVED PARTIAL CAPSULECTOMY, SYSTEMIC CHEMOTHERAPY, OR RADIATION THERAPY.Â¿ CYTOLOGICAL MARKERS ALK- AND CD30+ HAVE BEEN REPORTED. THERE IS CURRENTLY NO WAY TO DETERMINE WHICH CASES HAD WHICH THERAPIES OR DEVICE TYPE.
