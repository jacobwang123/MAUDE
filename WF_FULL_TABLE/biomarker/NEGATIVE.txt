SHE BECAME EXTREMELY ILL IN (B)(6) 2012, SHE DID NOT GO TO THE HOSPITAL UNTIL (B)(6) 2013 BECAUSE SHE DID NOT HAVE ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE.

ON (B)(6) 2013 SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH METASTATIC BREAST CANCER TO BRAIN, LIVER, ESSENTIALLY THROUGHOUT HER ENTIRE BODY. SHE WAS TRANSFERRED TO INPATIENT REHAB ON (B)(6) 2013. FOLLOW UP VISIT WITH THE NEUROLOGIST SHOWED THAT ALTHOUGH SHE HAD MANY BRAIN LESIONS, THE SPINAL TAP WAS NEGATIVE FOR CANCER CELLS. A FULL BODY AND BRAIN PET SCAN WAS COMPLETED ON (B)(6) 2013. THIS SHOWED THAT SHE HAD LESIONS (TOO MANY TO COUNT) THROUGHOUT HER ENTIRE BODY. THE NEUROLOGIST WAS NOT CONVINCED THAT IT WAS METASTATIC BREAST CANCER IN THE BRAIN BECAUSE IT WAS ATYPICAL OF WHAT HE SAW WITH BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. HE THOUGHT POSSIBLE SARCOID OR LYMPHOMA. THE NEUROLOGIST STARTED HER ON LARGE DOSES OF STEROIDS AND OVER SEVERAL MONTHS AND REPEATED THE FULL BODY AND BRAIN PET SCAN ON (B)(6) 2013 WHICH THE RADIOLOGIST COMPARED TO THE PET SCAN OF (B)(6) 2013. THE RADIOLOGIST REPORTED THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE LESIONS FOUND ON THE (B)(6) 2013 EXAM HAD ESSENTIALLY ""MELTED"" AWAY AND THE HYPER METABOLIC BOWEL WAS COMPLETELY RESOLVED. HE ALSO WROTE ""BOTH OF THE ABOVE FINDINGS UNDOUBTEDLY REPRESENT SARCOID. AS THE NEUROLOGIST BEGAN TAPERING OFF THE STEROIDS, HE REPEATED SEVERAL MRI'S OF HER BRAIN, IN (B)(6) 2013, SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY AND BEGAN INCREASING THE STEROIDS TO SOME DEGREE. IN (B)(6) 2015, SHE BEGAN HAVING VISION PROBLEMS AND HEADACHES. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE LESIONS HAD RETURNED AND THIS TIME, THEY WERE ON HER RETINAS AS WELL THROUGHOUT HER ENTIRE BODY.

IN 1975 I HAD DOW CORNING BREAST IMPLANTS PLACED IN MY BODY FOR COSMETIC REASONS. I WAS A HEALTHY 33 YEAR OLD WOMAN. AFTER BEING TOLD IMPLANTS WERE PERFECTLY SAFE AND THAT THEY WOULD LAST A LIFE TIME I WILLINGLY SIGNED UP FOR SURGERY. WITHIN THREE MONTHS I DEVELOPED HARD CAPSULES BILATERALLY. MY SURGEON ASSURED ME ALL WAS WELL, HOWEVER HE WOULD NEED TO PERFORM A CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY IN ORDER TO SOFTEN BOTH BREASTS. I RECALL BEING FEARFUL OF THIS PROCEDURE AS A) MY SURGEON MADE ME PROMISE ""NOT TO YELL"" AND B) THERE WOULD BE NO ANESTHESIA. PROCEDURE WAS INDEED VERY PAINFUL AS HE MANUALLY APPLIED PRESSURE TO EACH BREAST AND ""CRACKED"" THEM. I FELT A TEARING SENSATION AROUND EACH BREAST. THIS WAS FIRST OF NINE CLOSED CAPSULOTOMIES, AND I SUSPECT MY LEFT IMPLANT WAS RUPTURED FROM VERY FIRST ONE. ONE YEAR AFTER IMPLANTATION I BEGAN TO HAVE PAIN IN JOINTS OF MY RIGHT HAND AND A STRANGE RASH APPEARED ON MY CHEST AND ARMS. THREE YEARS LATER I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH THYROID CANCER. WHEN I COLLECTED ALL MY MEDICAL RECORDS OVER LAST FEW YEARS I FOUND MY BIOPSY WHICH REFERRED NOT ONLY TO MY MALIGNANT TUMOR, BUT ALSO TO ""YELLOW GELATINOUS MATERIAL"" SURROUNDING MY THYROID GLAND. EVEN THOUGH MY MEDICAL RECORDS CLEARLY STATED I HAD HAD A BREAST AUGMENTATION, NO ONE AT TIME OF SURGERY MENTIONED PRESENCE OF A FOREIGN BODY MATERIAL FOUND IN MY GLAND. MY TUMOR WAS REMOVED YET AN OBVIOUSLY RUPTURED IMPLANT WAS ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN MY BODY FOR SEVERAL MORE YEARS. IT IS KNOWN THAT MOST OF MEDICAL COMMUNITY REFUSES TO ADMIT ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS AND DISEASE; HOWEVER, GIVEN THE PRESENCE OF SILICA THOUGHOUT MY THYROID GLAND AND LYMPH NODES THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND AS TO WHAT CAUSED MY CANCER. SIX YEARS AFTER IMPLANTATION MY RASH CONTINUED TO SPREAD, MY JOINTS ACHED AND MY LEFT BREAST BECAME PAINFUL AND ""HOT"" FEELING. MY LEFT NIPPLE ALSO TURNED A DARKER COLOR THAN OTHER ONE. I FELT FATIGUED, AND DISORIENTATED MOST OF TIME. I CONTINUED TO SEEK MEDICAL CARE AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS NO EXPLANATION FOR MY BODY RASH. MY PHYSICIANS COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR MY SLOW RECOVERY FROM THYROID CANCER AND ALL RELATED TREATMENTS I ENDURED. DUE TO PAIN AND CONTINUED HARDENING OF MY LEFT BREAST MY SURGEON DECIDED TO REPLACE THIS IMPLANT WITH ANOTHER DOW CORNING UNIT. AFTER SURGERY HE DID NOT TELL ME THAT EXPLANTED IMPLANT WAS RUPTURED (I LEARNED ABOUT RUPTURE WHEN COLLECTING ALL MY DATA THREE YEARS AGO). TWELVE YEARS AFTER IMPLANTATION I BEGAN TO HAVE TREMORS IN MY LEFT HAND, CHRONIC GASTRITIS, JOINT ACHE AND A ""PINS AND NEEDLES"" SENSATION IN MY LEGS AND ARMS. AT TIMES I IMAGINED SPIDERS WERE CRAWLING ON MY LEGS. FROM THIS POINT MY HEALTH WENT INTO A DOWNWARD SPIRAL AND I BECAME MORE DEPRESSED AS EACH DOCTOR'S APPT SUGGESTED SAME METHOD OF TREATMENT... SEEK MENTAL THERAPY. BY 1994, AFTER 19 YEARS OF IMPLANTS, MY HEALTH HIT ROCK BOTTOM. I WAS FATIGUED BEYOND POINT OF RECOVERY, NERVOUS, DEPRESSED AND, YES, SUICIDAL. MY BODY WOULD REACT TO SLIGHTEST STIMULANT AND I WAS HAVING SEVERE MEMORY LOSS, AND I BECAME DYSLEXIC. AT ONE POINT I WENT TO OUR LOCAL MARKET, LESS THAN A MILE FROM HOME, AND I COULDN'T REMEMBER HOW TO DRIVE HOME. I BEGAN TO LOSE MY BALANCE AND I HAD DISTORTED VISION. EVEN TODAY ONE OF MY PUPILS DOES NOT DILATE NORMALLY. I RETURNED MANY TIMES TO TRY TO FIND A CURE FOR MY RACING HEARTBEAT, MY RASH, STIFFNESS AND PAIN IN MY LIMBS, TREMOR IN MY HAND, EYE AND VAGINAL DRYNESS. AGAIN I WAS TOLD TO SEEK COUNSELING. OVER THIS PERIOD MY MARRIAGE FAILED AND I BEGAN TO THINK I WAS REALLY CRAZY. I CONSIDERED TAKING MY LIFE MANY TIMES. BY 1994 I WAS FALLING INTO A DEEP HOLE. AFTER A NEAR HEAD ON COLLISION BECAUSE I WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY DISCERNING LEFT FROM RIGHT I BEGAN TO FEAR DRIVING. MY LIFE WAS OUT OF CONTROL. AS A RESULT OF ALL MEDIA COVERAGE AROUND 1994 ON BREAST IMPLANTS I RETURNED TO MY PLASTIC SURGEON. HE TOLD ME THERE COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN MY ""IMAGINED SYMPTOMS"" AND BREAST IMPLANTS. HE DID, HOWEVER, CONCEDE THAT MY IMPLANTS ""LOOKED TERRIBLE"" DUE TO EVER PRESENT CAPSULES. HE RELUCTANTLY AGREED TO REMOVE MY IMPLANTS ON MAY 4, 1994. OF COURSE IT WAS SUGGESTED I REPLACE THEM WITH SALINE IMPLANTS WHICH I DECLINED. ONE MONTH AFTER EXPLANTATION I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BRAIN LESIONS WHICH EXPLAINS MY DIAGNOSES OF ATYPICAL MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. FOR SIX MONTHS MY SYMPTOMS SEEM TO INTENSIFY AND THEN I BEGAN TO SLOWLY IMPROVE. TODAY I LIVE WITH DISCOMFORT AND PAIN OF STIFF LEGS AND SENSATION OF SPIDERS ON MY SKIN IS STILL WITH ME. CLIMATE EXTREMES MAKES PAIN IN MY LEGS UNBEARABLE. MY MEMORY HAS IMPROVED AND I NO LONGER SUFFER, OR CAUSE OTHERS TO SUFFER, THOSE HORRIBLE AND UNPREDICTABLE MOOD SWINGS. MY CANCER IS IN REMISSION AND I AM ON MEDICATION FOR REST OF MY LIFE. MY RASH, IT APPEARS, IS WITH ME FOR LIFE. EVEN THOUGH I'VE HAD SOME IMPROVEMENT MY HEALTH HAS BEEN PERMANENTLY DAMAGED BY BREAST IMPLANTS. WHAT HAS ALL THIS MEANT TO ME? I AM ANGRY TO HAVE LOST 19 YEARS OF MY LIFE TO AVARICE AND DECEPTION OF DOW CORNING. I MOURN LOSS OF MY FIRST MARRIAGE AND I CAN'T HELP WONDERING WHAT LONG TERM HEALTH RISKS ARE FOR ME AND MY FELLOW SURVIVORS. WOULD I HAVE CONSENTED TO BREAST IMPLANTS HAD I BEEN TOLD OF CONSEQUENCES OR GIVEN CONSIDERATION OF READING MANY NEGATIVE TEST RESULTS DOW CORNING HAD AVAILABLE AS EARLY AS 1975? ABSOLUTELY NOT! I WILL DO ALL THAT IS POSSIBLE TO DISCOURAGE YOUNGER WOMEN FROM PURSUING IMPLANTS BE THEY SALINE, SOY, OR WHATEVER ELSE SOME MISGUIDED SCIENTIST DREAMS UP. I STRUGGLE EACH DAY TO COME TO TERMS WITH WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME. THER'S A PART OF ME THAT WANTS TO DENY DECEPTION AND LIES OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. IN OTHER WORDS I STILL WANT TO TRUST AND BELIEVE IN THE GOODNESS OF MAN. THIS I REALIZE IS A FALLACY.

TWELVE YEARS AFTER IMPLANTATION I BEGAN TO HAVE TREMORS IN MY LEFT HAND, CHRONIC GASTRITIS, JOINT ACHE AND A ""PINS AND NEEDLES"" SENSATION IN MY LEGS AND ARMS. AT TIMES I IMAGINED SPIDERS WERE CRAWLING ON MY LEGS. FROM THIS POINT MY HEALTH WENT INTO A DOWNWARD SPRIAL AND I BECAME MORE DEPRESSED AS EACH DR'S APPOINTMENT SUGGESTED SAME METHOD OF TREATMENT...SEEK MENTAL THERAPY. BY 1994, AFTER 19 YEARS OF IMPLANTS, MY HEALTH HIT ROCK BOTTOM. I WAS FATIGUED BEYOND THE POINT OF RECOVERY, NERVOUS, DEPRESSED AND, YES, SUICIDAL. MY BODY WOULD REACT TO SLIGHTEST STIMULANT AND I WAS HAVING SEVERE MEMORY LOSS, AND I BECAME DYSLEXIC. AT ONE POINT I WENT TO OUR LOCAL MARKET, LESS THAN A MILE FROM HOME, AND I COULDN'T REMEMBER HOW TO DRIVE HOME. I BEGAN TO LOSE MY BALANCE AND I HAD DISTORTED VISION. EVEN TODAY ONE OF MY PUPILS DOES NOT DILATE NORMALLY. I RETURNED MANY TIMES TO TRY TO FIND A CURE FOR MY RACING HEARTBEAT, MY RASH, STIFFNESS AND PAIN IN MY LIMBS, TREMOR IN MY HAND, EYE AND VAGINAL DRYNESS. AGAIN I WAS TOLD TO SEEK COUNSELING. OVER THIS PERIOD MY MARRIAGE FAILED AND I BEGAN TO THINK I WAS REALLY CRAZY. I CONSIDERED TAKING MY LIFE MANY TIMES. BY 1994 I WAS FALLING INTO A DEEP HOLE. AFTER A NEAR HEAD ON COLLISION BECAUSE I WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY DISCERNING LEFT FROM RIGHT I BEGAN TO FEAR DRIVING. MY LIFE WAS OUT OF CONTROL. AS A RESULT OF ALL THE MEDIA COVEREAGE AROUND 1994 ON BREAST IMPLANTS I RETURNED TO MY PLASTIC SURGEON. HE TOLD ME THERE COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN MY ""IMAGINED SYMPTOMS"" AND BREAST IMPLANTS. HE DID, HOWEVER, CONCEDE THAT MY IMPLANTS ""LOOKED TERRIBLE"" DUE TO EVER PRESENT CAPSULES. HE RELUCTANTLY AGREED TO REMOVE MY IMPLANTS ON 5/4/94. OF COURSE IT WAS SUGGESTED I REPLACE THEM WITH SALINE IMPLANTS WHICH I DECLINED. ONE MONTH AFTER EXPLANTATION I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BRAIN LESIONS WHICH EXPLAINS MY DIAGNOSES OF ATYPICAL MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. FOR SIX MONTHS MY SYMPTOMS SEEM TO INTENSIFY AND THEN I BEGAN TO SLOWLY IMPROVE. TODAY I LIVE WITH DISCOMFORT AND PAIN OF STIFF LEGS AND SENSATION OF SPIDERS ON MY SKIN IS STILL WITH ME. CLIMATE EXTREMES MAKES PAIN IN MY LEGS UNBEARABLE. MY MEMORY HAS IMPROVED AND I NO LONGER SUFFER, OR CAUSE OTHERS TO SUFFER, THOSE HORRIBLE AND UNPREDICTABLE MOOD SWINGS. MY CANCER IS IN REMISSION AND I AM ON MEDICATION FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. MY RASH, IT APPEARS, IS WITH ME FOR LIFE. EVEN THOUGH I'VE HAD SOME IMPROVEMENT MY HEALTH HAS BEEN PERMANENTLY DAMAGED BY BREAST IMPLANTS. WHAT HAS ALL THIS MEANT TO ME? I AM ANGRY TO HAVE LOST 19 YEARS OF MY LIFE TO THE AVARICE AND DECEPTION OF DOW CORNING. I MOURN THE LOSS OF MY FIRST MARRIAGE AND I CAN'T HELP WONDERING WHAT THE LONG TERM HEALTH RISKS ARE FOR ME AND MY FELLOW SURVIVORS. WOULD I HAVE CONSENTED TO BREAST IMPLANTS HAD I BEEN TOLD OF THE CONSEQUENCES OR GIVEN CONSIDERATION OF READING MANY NEGATIVE TEST RESULTS DOW CORNING HAD AVAILABLE AS EARLY AS 1975? ABSOLUTELY NOT! I WILL DO ALL THAT IS POSSIBLE TO DISCOURAGE YOUNGER WOMEN FROM PURSUING IMPLANTS BE THEY SALINE, SOY, OR WHATEVER ELSE SOME MISGUIDED SCIENTIST DREAMS UP. I STRUGGLE EACH DAY TO COME TO TERMS WITH WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME. THERE'S A PART OF ME THAT WANTS TO DENY THE DECEPTION AND LIES OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. IN OTHER WORDS I STILL WANT TO TRUST AND BELIEVE IN GOODNESS OF MAN. THIS I REALIZE IS A FALLACY. I STRONGLY URGE THAT ALL IMPLANTS BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET..."""|GEL-FILLED MAMMARY IMPLANT|350-7200|03/27/1995|Y|||Y||20620.0|*|FTR|1.0||BREAST IMPLANT|Y|229038|*||MIDLAND|US|DOW CORNING CORP.||MI|48686|0994|*|LEFT|True

2163607|2106125|D|1||"I'M WRITING MY STORY TO THE FDA. THIS IS ABOUT MY BREAST SILICONE IMPLANTS THAT HAVE BEEN BLEEDING OUT FOR 7 OR MORE YEARS. I STARTED TO CONTINUALLY TO BE SICK WITH SYMPTOMS LIKE: LOW GRADE FEVERS 99.6 TO 100.8 (ALL THE TIME), FATIGUE, SWOLLEN LYMPH NODES, FLU-LIKE SYMPTOMS, NIGHT SWEATS, INSOMNIA, BACKACHES, WEIGHT LOSS, WEIGHT GAIN, BONES HURTING, CANKER SORES IN MY MOUTH FOR 4 MONTHS AND ON AND OFF FOR 2 YEARS, LARGE SUB LINGUAL TONSILS, COUGHING, WEAKNESS, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, CHEST PAINS, PAIN DEEP IN THE BONES, MEMORY LOSS. UNTIL (B)(6) 2007, WHEN MY BLOOD PRESSURE WENT UP AND I STARTED GETTING CHEST PAINS, THEN I SAW MY CARDIOLOGIST. HE RAN ALL THE TESTS, ECHO, THALLIUM TREADMILL AND BP MONITOR WITH BLOOD TESTS. ALL THE TESTS CAME BACK NEGATIVE EXCEPT FOR MY CRP, IT WAS 20.6. THIS HAD MY CARDIOLOGIST CONCERNED. HE ASKED THAT I RETURNED IN 2 MONTHS FOR A REPEAT TEST TO SEE IF IT WAS STILL HIGH 20.1. IN (B)(6), THE TEST WAS REPEATED WITH THE SAME RESULT 20.1. SENT ME FOR A CHEST CT SCAN. CAME BACK ABNORMAL AGAIN. MY CT SHOWED MANY SPOTS WITH INFILTRATES IN BOTH LUNGS AND PATCHY SPOTS WITH ABNORMAL LYMPH NODES. HE REFERRED ME TO A PULMONOLOGIST; SHE SAID I NEED A LYMPH NODE BIOPSY IN MY AXILLARY'S NODES, WANTED TO R/O LYMPHOMA. SHE HAD MORE BLOOD TEST DONE AND MY CPR WAS UP TO 43 AND SED RATE WAS UP, WBC WAS UP, BLOOD WORK IS STARTING TO COME BACK ABNORMAL. SHE REFERRED ME TO A GENERAL SURGEON TO PERFORM THE BIOPSY AND THE BIOPSY CAME BACK SHOWING SILICONE IN THE LYMPH NODES AND ALSO IN MY MEDIA-STERNUM FROM THE LAST BIOPSY. THE DOCTORS ARE NOW SAYING THIS HAS BEEN LEAKING INTO SYSTEM SLOWLY SINCE BEFORE 2004 AND MY AUTOIMMUNE SYSTEM HAS BEEN FIGHTING, WHICH IS WHY I HAVE BEEN SO SICK. WELL, THE 1ST SURGERY WAS ON (B)(6) 2007. THE INCISIONS ARE ABOUT 3IN ON BOTH SIDE OF MY PELVIC AREA. THIS SURGERY WILL BE DIVIDING THE INFERIOR EPIGASTRIC BLOOD VESSELS, TRAINING THE TRAM TISSUES TO RELY ON THE SUPERIOR EPIGASTRIC SYSTEM. THIS STEP IS NOT REQUIRED FOR SUCCESSFUL PEDICLE TRAM RECONSTRUCTION BUT CAN IMPROVE BLOOD SUPPLY TO THE FLAP. SO-CALLED DELAY PROCEDURES MAY EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY OF PERFORMING MICROSURGERY (""SUPERCHARGING"") IF THE PEDICLE FLAP HAS ANY ARTERIAL OR VENOUS INSUFFICIENCY PROBLEMS, SINCE THE VESSELS DIVIDED IN THE ""DELAY"" CANNOT BE USED. IT IS INFECTING MY LUNGS AND IMMUNE SYSTEM AND OTHER MAJOR ORGANS. IN ALL I HAD A MINIMUM OF 13 MAJOR SURGERIES WHICH INCLUDE MORE RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY AND WOUND CARE, DEVELOP NECROSIS FROM THE SURGERY, ALL THE SILICONE COULD NOT BE REMOVED. I HAD DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH AND THERE IS VERY LITTLE ABOUT MY CONDITION AND SILICONE ILLNESS. BOTH THE SURGEON AND PLASTIC SURGEON HAVE SAID THIS IS A VERY RARE CONDITION. ON (B)(6) 2007, BILATERAL PEDICLES TRAM FLAP WITH THE REMOVAL OF SILICONE IMPLANTS. BOTH IMPLANTS WERE RUPTURED AND BLEEDING OUT, MORE ON THE LEFT THEN ON THE RIGHT SIDE. BUT THE PLASTIC SURGEON -PS- SAID THESE HAVE BEEN LEAKING FOR A LONG TIME. THE PS CLEANED ALL THE AREA WHILE NOT TO DISTURB THE BLOOD VESSEL FOR THE TRAM FLAPS. THE PS USED THE SKIN OF THE BREASTS FROM WHERE HE REMOVED THE IMPLANTS AND TRANSPLANTED THE FLAPS BILATERALLY TO KEEP ME THE SAME SIZE AND SYMMETRICALLY. THE ABDOMEN REPAIR ""TUMMY TUCK"". THERE HAS BEEN SOME BRUISING AROUND THE ""NEW PLACEMENT"" OF THE BELLY BUTTON AND ABDOMEN AROUND THERE. THE PS USED MESH FOR MY ABDOMEN INSTEAD OF ALLODERM, BECAUSE THE MESH WAS STRONGER. I CAN FEEL THAT MESH WHEN I WALK. I WAS IN SURGERY FOR 8 1/2 HOURS AND SUFFERED RESPIRATORY FAILURE WITH PULMONARY EDEMA WITHIN THE FIRST 24 HOURS. I WAS MOVED TO THE FLOOR AND DEVELOPED PNEUMONIA IN THE RIGHT LOWER LOBE. I SWEAR, I WAS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT BASED ON BREATHING. ANTIBIOTICS PUSH AND LASIX PUSH AND PLENTY OF RESPIRATORY THERAPY, WHEN I GOT HOME I HAD EXTRA EQUIPMENT OXYGEN, WALKER, AND HOSPITAL BED. I WAS ON A LOT OF ANTIBIOTICS AND PAIN PILLS. I WENT TO THE DOCTOR AND IT LOOKS LIKE I'M GOING TO BE ADMITTED BACK INTO THE HOSPITAL ON (B)(6) 2008 FOR MORE SURGERY FOR A WOUND THAT DEVELOPED IN THE ABDOMEN. THE SURGERY IS FOR DEBRIDEMENT OF THE WOUND THAT IS NOT HEALING AND PLACING A WOUND VAC ON IT. THE DOCTOR WILL HAVE TO REDO 8 INCHES OF THE INCISION. I WILL BE IN THE HOSPITAL FOR 2-3 DAYS; I WILL HAVE TO PRAY MORE. THE SURGERY IS SUPPOSED TO TAKE 1 TO 1 1/2 HOUR; WITH THE COMPLICATIONS OF MY LUNGS THAT TIME SHOULDN'T BE TOO BAD. I WAS AFRAID OF DEVELOPING INFECTION, (B)(6). THEN 6 WEEKS OF THE WOUND VAC ON MY ABDOMEN. I DID DEVELOP (B)(6) AND WAS HOSPITALIZE FOR 4 MONTHS IN 2008. I HAVE STARTED TO SEE THE TRANSPLANTATION TEAM TO HAVE A POSSIBLE LUNG REMOVED BEFORE I RUN OUT OF TIME. BOTH LUNGS ARE FILLED WITH SILICONE, AS WELL AS MY KIDNEYS, AND MY GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT. MY PULMONARY DOCTOR I HAVE HAS BEEN WITH ME FOR 4 YEARS, AND SHE HAS SEEN ME GET WORSE THROUGH ON-GOING TESTS AND YEARS. WITH THE LUNG BIOPSIES (B)(6) 2011, SHOWING SILICONE THROUGHOUT MY LUNGS, SHE THEN SAW MY LAST PFTS AND IT WAS WORSE BY 80% SINCE (B)(6) 2011, AND MY O2 LEVEL IS AT 7 LITERS NOW. IT HAS GONE UP BY 3 LITERS SINCE (B)(6) 2010. SO CURRENTLY, I AM GOING THROUGH THE PRE-TESTING FOR LUNG TRANSPLANTS TO SEE IF I QUALIFY FOR THE TRANSPLANTS. SO I HAVE TO GO THROUGH A LOT OF TESTING TO SEE IF MY BODY CAN HANDLE THE TRANSPLANTS. ONLY MY DOCTOR UNDERSTANDS EVERYTHING ABOUT WHAT IMPLANTS CAN DO TO YOU. SHE HAS SEEN ME GO THROUGH IT A LOT. WHEN MY IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED IN 2007, THE DOCTOR HAD TO LEAVE THE OUTER PART IN BECAUSE MY TISSUE WAS ALREADY TAKEN OVER. MY IMPLANTS HAD BEEN LEAKING UP TO 7 YEARS PER THE TIMELINE OF ALL THE ISSUE WITH MY HEALTH PER MY DOCTORS. I HOPE THE LUNG TRANSPLANTS WILL BE APPROVE TO PLACE ME ON THE ORGAN TRANSPLANT LIST. SILICONE IMPLANTS SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL MORE AND NEW UPDATED RESEARCH IS DONE. PLEASE, I BEG YOU TO LISTEN."|MENTOR||07/11/2011||12/04/2007||R|||0|FTR|1.0||BREAST IMPLANTS|||||||MENTOR|||||MENTOR||True

I LOVED THEM, EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE ROCK HARD, I WAS HAPPY. I COULD NEVER PROPERLY BREATHE, AND WHEN I LAY FLAT, MY HEART PALPITATES AND MY BREATHS BECAME SHORT. I WAS WILLING TO LIVE WITH THAT SINCE I JUST PAID (B)(6) FOR THEM. A FEW MONTHS LATER, AROUND (B)(6) I STARTED GETTING DEBILITATING FATIGUE THAT MADE ME FEEL DOWN. A GREY SHADE WOULD COME OVER MY EYESIGHT, ESPECIALLY WHEN I WAS UNDER SUNLIGHT. I TRIED NATURAL SUPPLEMENTS FROM HEALTH STORES. NOTHING WORKED.

ANALYSIS OF THE MICROBIOME IN BREAST IMPLANTÂ¿ASSOCIATED ALCL SPECIMENS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WITH SPECIES IDENTIFIED IN NONTUMOR CAPSULE SPECIMENS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER PROPORTION OF RALSTONIA SPP. PRESENT IN ALCL SPECIMENS COMPARED WITH NONTUMOR CAPSULE SPECIMENS (P < 0.05). IN CONTRAST, SIGNIFICANTLY MORE STAPHYLOCOCCUS SPP. WERE FOUND ASSOCIATED WITH NONTUMOR CAPSULE SPECIMENS COMPARED WITH BREAST IMPLANTÂ¿ASSOCIATED ALCL SPECIMENS (P < 0.001). BACTERIAL BIOFILM WAS VISUALIZED BOTH ON SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY AND FLUORESCENT IN SITU HYBRIDIZATION.Â¿ CYTOLOGICAL MARKERS ALK- AND CD30+ HAVE BEEN REPORTED. ACCORDING TO TABLE 1 Â¿CLINICAL SUMMARY OF BREAST IMPLANTÂ¿ASSOCIATED ALCL PATIENTS,Â¿ THERE WAS 1 CASE OF ALCL WHICH PRESENTED WITH BOTH EFFUSION AND TUMOR. THERE IS CURRENTLY NO WAY TO DETERMINE WHICH CASES HAD WHICH DEVICE TYPE OR TESTED NEGATIVE FOR BACTERIAL INFECTION. THIS REPORT WILL CAPTURE 1 CASE OF ALCL WHICH PRESENTED WITH BOTH EFFUSION AND TUMOR.|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|UNK MAMMARY IMPLANT|12/07/2016||||*|*||0HP|FWM|1.0||PROSTHESIS, BREAST, INFLATABLE, INTERNAL, SALINE||NI|||||UNKNOWN MANUFACTURER|||||||True
