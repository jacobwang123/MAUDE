SHE BECAME EXTREMELY ILL IN (B)(6) 2012, SHE DID NOT GO TO THE HOSPITAL UNTIL (B)(6) 2013 BECAUSE SHE DID NOT HAVE ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. SHE WAS ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL ON (B)(6) 2013 WITH UNCONTROLLED DIARRHEA. SHE WAS ADMITTED AGAIN ON (B)(6) 2013 WITH DEHYDRATION AND ON (B)(6) 2013 DEHYDRATION. ON (B)(6) 2013 SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH METASTATIC BREAST CANCER TO BRAIN, LIVER, ESSENTIALLY THROUGHOUT HER ENTIRE BODY. SHE WAS TRANSFERRED TO INPATIENT REHAB ON (B)(6) 2013. FOLLOW UP VISIT WITH THE NEUROLOGIST SHOWED THAT ALTHOUGH SHE HAD MANY BRAIN LESIONS, THE SPINAL TAP WAS NEGATIVE FOR CANCER CELLS. A FULL BODY AND BRAIN PET SCAN WAS COMPLETED ON (B)(6) 2013. THIS SHOWED THAT SHE HAD LESIONS (TOO MANY TO COUNT) THROUGHOUT HER ENTIRE BODY. THE NEUROLOGIST WAS NOT CONVINCED THAT IT WAS METASTATIC BREAST CANCER IN THE BRAIN BECAUSE IT WAS ATYPICAL OF WHAT HE SAW WITH BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. HE THOUGHT POSSIBLE SARCOID OR LYMPHOMA. THE NEUROLOGIST STARTED HER ON LARGE DOSES OF STEROIDS AND OVER SEVERAL MONTHS AND REPEATED THE FULL BODY AND BRAIN PET SCAN ON (B)(6) 2013 WHICH THE RADIOLOGIST COMPARED TO THE PET SCAN OF (B)(6) 2013. THE RADIOLOGIST REPORTED THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE LESIONS FOUND ON THE (B)(6) 2013 EXAM HAD ESSENTIALLY ""MELTED"" AWAY AND THE HYPER METABOLIC BOWEL WAS COMPLETELY RESOLVED. HE ALSO WROTE ""BOTH OF THE ABOVE FINDINGS UNDOUBTEDLY REPRESENT SARCOID. AS THE NEUROLOGIST BEGAN TAPERING OFF THE STEROIDS, HE REPEATED SEVERAL MRI'S OF HER BRAIN, IN (B)(6) 2013, SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY AND BEGAN INCREASING THE STEROIDS TO SOME DEGREE. IN (B)(6) 2015, SHE BEGAN HAVING VISION PROBLEMS AND HEADACHES. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE LESIONS HAD RETURNED AND THIS TIME, THEY WERE ON HER RETINAS AS WELL THROUGHOUT HER ENTIRE BODY. WE TOOK HER TO (B)(6) CLINIC FOR EVALUATION OF HER RETINAS. WE DISCUSSED OUR THEORY THAT THIS WAS POSSIBLY RELATED TO THE BREAST IMPLANT AND NOT BREAST METASTASES. THE PHYSICIANS AT (B)(6) REVIEWED ALL OF THE MEDICAL RECORDS THAT WE BROUGHT WITH US AND FELT THAT SARCOID WAS A POSSIBILITY BUT WOULD NEED TO BIOPSY HER RETINA TO DETERMINE FOR SURE. THE BIOPSY WAS DONE AT (B)(6) CLINIC AND WAS REPORTED TO BE BREAST METASTASES. AT THIS POINT, SHE CONTINUED WITH FOLLOW UP VISITS TO MULTIPLE DOCTORS. ON (B)(6) 2015 MET WITH ONCOLOGISTS AT (B)(6) AT FAMILY REQUEST - PATIENT AND FAMILY REQUESTED THAT THE IMPLANT BE REMOVED BUT THEY DID NOT WANT TO DO IT. SHE MET WITH (B)(6) ONCOLOGIST ON (B)(6) 2015 WHERE SHE AGAIN REQUESTED THAT THE IMPLANT BE REMOVED. THE ONCOLOGIST SCHEDULED A LIVER BIOPSY AND THAT WAS DONE ON (B)(6) 2015. REPEATED VISITS TO DIFFERENT ONCOLOGISTS REPORTED THAT SHE HAD BREAST METASTASES AND WOULD NEED CHEMOTHERAPY. SHE REFUSED TO UNDERGO CHEMOTHERAPY. SHE HAD A LIVER BIOPSY ON (B)(6) 2015 AT (B)(6) CANCER INSTITUTE AND AGAIN SHE RECEIVED THE DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST METASTASES. SHE PASSED AWAY ON (B)(6) 2015 AT THE AGE OF (B)(6) YEARS.

IN 1975 I HAD DOW CORNING BREAST IMPLANTS PLACED IN MY BODY FOR COSMETIC REASONS. I WAS A HEALTHY 33 YEAR OLD WOMAN. AFTER BEING TOLD IMPLANTS WERE PERFECTLY SAFE AND THAT THEY WOULD LAST A LIFE TIME I WILLINGLY SIGNED UP FOR SURGERY. WITHIN THREE MONTHS I DEVELOPED HARD CAPSULES BILATERALLY. MY SURGEON ASSURED ME ALL WAS WELL, HOWEVER HE WOULD NEED TO PERFORM A CLOSED CAPSULOTOMY IN ORDER TO SOFTEN BOTH BREASTS. I RECALL BEING FEARFUL OF THIS PROCEDURE AS A) MY SURGEON MADE ME PROMISE ""NOT TO YELL"" AND B) THERE WOULD BE NO ANESTHESIA. PROCEDURE WAS INDEED VERY PAINFUL AS HE MANUALLY APPLIED PRESSURE TO EACH BREAST AND ""CRACKED"" THEM. I FELT A TEARING SENSATION AROUND EACH BREAST. THIS WAS FIRST OF NINE CLOSED CAPSULOTOMIES, AND I SUSPECT MY LEFT IMPLANT WAS RUPTURED FROM VERY FIRST ONE. ONE YEAR AFTER IMPLANTATION I BEGAN TO HAVE PAIN IN JOINTS OF MY RIGHT HAND AND A STRANGE RASH APPEARED ON MY CHEST AND ARMS. THREE YEARS LATER I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH THYROID CANCER. WHEN I COLLECTED ALL MY MEDICAL RECORDS OVER LAST FEW YEARS I FOUND MY BIOPSY WHICH REFERRED NOT ONLY TO MY MALIGNANT TUMOR, BUT ALSO TO ""YELLOW GELATINOUS MATERIAL"" SURROUNDING MY THYROID GLAND. EVEN THOUGH MY MEDICAL RECORDS CLEARLY STATED I HAD HAD A BREAST AUGMENTATION, NO ONE AT TIME OF SURGERY MENTIONED PRESENCE OF A FOREIGN BODY MATERIAL FOUND IN MY GLAND. MY TUMOR WAS REMOVED YET AN OBVIOUSLY RUPTURED IMPLANT WAS ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN MY BODY FOR SEVERAL MORE YEARS. IT IS KNOWN THAT MOST OF MEDICAL COMMUNITY REFUSES TO ADMIT ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS AND DISEASE; HOWEVER, GIVEN THE PRESENCE OF SILICA THOUGHOUT MY THYROID GLAND AND LYMPH NODES THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND AS TO WHAT CAUSED MY CANCER. SIX YEARS AFTER IMPLANTATION MY RASH CONTINUED TO SPREAD, MY JOINTS ACHED AND MY LEFT BREAST BECAME PAINFUL AND ""HOT"" FEELING. MY LEFT NIPPLE ALSO TURNED A DARKER COLOR THAN OTHER ONE. I FELT FATIGUED, AND DISORIENTATED MOST OF TIME. I CONTINUED TO SEEK MEDICAL CARE AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS NO EXPLANATION FOR MY BODY RASH. MY PHYSICIANS COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR MY SLOW RECOVERY FROM THYROID CANCER AND ALL RELATED TREATMENTS I ENDURED. DUE TO PAIN AND CONTINUED HARDENING OF MY LEFT BREAST MY SURGEON DECIDED TO REPLACE THIS IMPLANT WITH ANOTHER DOW CORNING UNIT. AFTER SURGERY HE DID NOT TELL ME THAT EXPLANTED IMPLANT WAS RUPTURED (I LEARNED ABOUT RUPTURE WHEN COLLECTING ALL MY DATA THREE YEARS AGO). TWELVE YEARS AFTER IMPLANTATION I BEGAN TO HAVE TREMORS IN MY LEFT HAND, CHRONIC GASTRITIS, JOINT ACHE AND A ""PINS AND NEEDLES"" SENSATION IN MY LEGS AND ARMS. AT TIMES I IMAGINED SPIDERS WERE CRAWLING ON MY LEGS. FROM THIS POINT MY HEALTH WENT INTO A DOWNWARD SPIRAL AND I BECAME MORE DEPRESSED AS EACH DOCTOR'S APPT SUGGESTED SAME METHOD OF TREATMENT... SEEK MENTAL THERAPY. BY 1994, AFTER 19 YEARS OF IMPLANTS, MY HEALTH HIT ROCK BOTTOM. I WAS FATIGUED BEYOND POINT OF RECOVERY, NERVOUS, DEPRESSED AND, YES, SUICIDAL. MY BODY WOULD REACT TO SLIGHTEST STIMULANT AND I WAS HAVING SEVERE MEMORY LOSS, AND I BECAME DYSLEXIC. AT ONE POINT I WENT TO OUR LOCAL MARKET, LESS THAN A MILE FROM HOME, AND I COULDN'T REMEMBER HOW TO DRIVE HOME. I BEGAN TO LOSE MY BALANCE AND I HAD DISTORTED VISION. EVEN TODAY ONE OF MY PUPILS DOES NOT DILATE NORMALLY. I RETURNED MANY TIMES TO TRY TO FIND A CURE FOR MY RACING HEARTBEAT, MY RASH, STIFFNESS AND PAIN IN MY LIMBS, TREMOR IN MY HAND, EYE AND VAGINAL DRYNESS. AGAIN I WAS TOLD TO SEEK COUNSELING. OVER THIS PERIOD MY MARRIAGE FAILED AND I BEGAN TO THINK I WAS REALLY CRAZY. I CONSIDERED TAKING MY LIFE MANY TIMES. BY 1994 I WAS FALLING INTO A DEEP HOLE. AFTER A NEAR HEAD ON COLLISION BECAUSE I WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY DISCERNING LEFT FROM RIGHT I BEGAN TO FEAR DRIVING. MY LIFE WAS OUT OF CONTROL. AS A RESULT OF ALL MEDIA COVERAGE AROUND 1994 ON BREAST IMPLANTS I RETURNED TO MY PLASTIC SURGEON. HE TOLD ME THERE COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN MY ""IMAGINED SYMPTOMS"" AND BREAST IMPLANTS. HE DID, HOWEVER, CONCEDE THAT MY IMPLANTS ""LOOKED TERRIBLE"" DUE TO EVER PRESENT CAPSULES. HE RELUCTANTLY AGREED TO REMOVE MY IMPLANTS ON MAY 4, 1994. OF COURSE IT WAS SUGGESTED I REPLACE THEM WITH SALINE IMPLANTS WHICH I DECLINED. ONE MONTH AFTER EXPLANTATION I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BRAIN LESIONS WHICH EXPLAINS MY DIAGNOSES OF ATYPICAL MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. FOR SIX MONTHS MY SYMPTOMS SEEM TO INTENSIFY AND THEN I BEGAN TO SLOWLY IMPROVE. TODAY I LIVE WITH DISCOMFORT AND PAIN OF STIFF LEGS AND SENSATION OF SPIDERS ON MY SKIN IS STILL WITH ME. CLIMATE EXTREMES MAKES PAIN IN MY LEGS UNBEARABLE. MY MEMORY HAS IMPROVED AND I NO LONGER SUFFER, OR CAUSE OTHERS TO SUFFER, THOSE HORRIBLE AND UNPREDICTABLE MOOD SWINGS. MY CANCER IS IN REMISSION AND I AM ON MEDICATION FOR REST OF MY LIFE. MY RASH, IT APPEARS, IS WITH ME FOR LIFE. EVEN THOUGH I'VE HAD SOME IMPROVEMENT MY HEALTH HAS BEEN PERMANENTLY DAMAGED BY BREAST IMPLANTS. WHAT HAS ALL THIS MEANT TO ME? I AM ANGRY TO HAVE LOST 19 YEARS OF MY LIFE TO AVARICE AND DECEPTION OF DOW CORNING. I MOURN LOSS OF MY FIRST MARRIAGE AND I CAN'T HELP WONDERING WHAT LONG TERM HEALTH RISKS ARE FOR ME AND MY FELLOW SURVIVORS. WOULD I HAVE CONSENTED TO BREAST IMPLANTS HAD I BEEN TOLD OF CONSEQUENCES OR GIVEN CONSIDERATION OF READING MANY NEGATIVE TEST RESULTS DOW CORNING HAD AVAILABLE AS EARLY AS 1975? ABSOLUTELY NOT! I WILL DO ALL THAT IS POSSIBLE TO DISCOURAGE YOUNGER WOMEN FROM PURSUING IMPLANTS BE THEY SALINE, SOY, OR WHATEVER ELSE SOME MISGUIDED SCIENTIST DREAMS UP. I STRUGGLE EACH DAY TO COME TO TERMS WITH WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME. THER'S A PART OF ME THAT WANTS TO DENY DECEPTION AND LIES OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. IN OTHER WORDS I STILL WANT TO TRUST AND BELIEVE IN THE GOODNESS OF MAN. THIS I REALIZE IS A FALLACY.

AT ONE POINT I WENT TO OUR LOCAL MARKET, LESS THAN A MILE FROM HOME, AND I COULDN'T REMEMBER HOW TO DRIVE HOME. I BEGAN TO LOSE MY BALANCE AND I HAD DISTORTED VISION. EVEN TODAY ONE OF MY PUPILS DOES NOT DILATE NORMALLY. I RETURNED MANY TIMES TO TRY TO FIND A CURE FOR MY RACING HEARTBEAT, MY RASH, STIFFNESS AND PAIN IN MY LIMBS, TREMOR IN MY HAND, EYE AND VAGINAL DRYNESS. AGAIN I WAS TOLD TO SEEK COUNSELING. OVER THIS PERIOD MY MARRIAGE FAILED AND I BEGAN TO THINK I WAS REALLY CRAZY. I CONSIDERED TAKING MY LIFE MANY TIMES. BY 1994 I WAS FALLING INTO A DEEP HOLE. AFTER A NEAR HEAD ON COLLISION BECAUSE I WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY DISCERNING LEFT FROM RIGHT I BEGAN TO FEAR DRIVING. MY LIFE WAS OUT OF CONTROL. AS A RESULT OF ALL THE MEDIA COVEREAGE AROUND 1994 ON BREAST IMPLANTS I RETURNED TO MY PLASTIC SURGEON. HE TOLD ME THERE COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN MY ""IMAGINED SYMPTOMS"" AND BREAST IMPLANTS. HE DID, HOWEVER, CONCEDE THAT MY IMPLANTS ""LOOKED TERRIBLE"" DUE TO EVER PRESENT CAPSULES. HE RELUCTANTLY AGREED TO REMOVE MY IMPLANTS ON 5/4/94. OF COURSE IT WAS SUGGESTED I REPLACE THEM WITH SALINE IMPLANTS WHICH I DECLINED. ONE MONTH AFTER EXPLANTATION I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BRAIN LESIONS WHICH EXPLAINS MY DIAGNOSES OF ATYPICAL MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. FOR SIX MONTHS MY SYMPTOMS SEEM TO INTENSIFY AND THEN I BEGAN TO SLOWLY IMPROVE. TODAY I LIVE WITH DISCOMFORT AND PAIN OF STIFF LEGS AND SENSATION OF SPIDERS ON MY SKIN IS STILL WITH ME. CLIMATE EXTREMES MAKES PAIN IN MY LEGS UNBEARABLE. MY MEMORY HAS IMPROVED AND I NO LONGER SUFFER, OR CAUSE OTHERS TO SUFFER, THOSE HORRIBLE AND UNPREDICTABLE MOOD SWINGS. MY CANCER IS IN REMISSION AND I AM ON MEDICATION FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. MY RASH, IT APPEARS, IS WITH ME FOR LIFE. EVEN THOUGH I'VE HAD SOME IMPROVEMENT MY HEALTH HAS BEEN PERMANENTLY DAMAGED BY BREAST IMPLANTS. WHAT HAS ALL THIS MEANT TO ME? I AM ANGRY TO HAVE LOST 19 YEARS OF MY LIFE TO THE AVARICE AND DECEPTION OF DOW CORNING. I MOURN THE LOSS OF MY FIRST MARRIAGE AND I CAN'T HELP WONDERING WHAT THE LONG TERM HEALTH RISKS ARE FOR ME AND MY FELLOW SURVIVORS. WOULD I HAVE CONSENTED TO BREAST IMPLANTS HAD I BEEN TOLD OF THE CONSEQUENCES OR GIVEN CONSIDERATION OF READING MANY NEGATIVE TEST RESULTS DOW CORNING HAD AVAILABLE AS EARLY AS 1975? ABSOLUTELY NOT! I WILL DO ALL THAT IS POSSIBLE TO DISCOURAGE YOUNGER WOMEN FROM PURSUING IMPLANTS BE THEY SALINE, SOY, OR WHATEVER ELSE SOME MISGUIDED SCIENTIST DREAMS UP. I STRUGGLE EACH DAY TO COME TO TERMS WITH WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME. THERE'S A PART OF ME THAT WANTS TO DENY THE DECEPTION AND LIES OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. IN OTHER WORDS I STILL WANT TO TRUST AND BELIEVE IN GOODNESS OF MAN. THIS I REALIZE IS A FALLACY. I STRONGLY URGE THAT ALL IMPLANTS BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET..."""|GEL-FILLED MAMMARY IMPLANT|350-7200|03/27/1995|Y|||Y||20620.0|*|FTR|1.0||BREAST IMPLANT|Y|229038|*||MIDLAND|US|DOW CORNING CORP.||MI|48686|0994|*|LEFT|True

ON HER FIRST VISIT UPON EXAMINING HER BREASTS, HE TOLD HER AND HER HUSBAND THAT THEY WERE CONSTRICTED. AS HE LOOKED AT THE MAMMOGRAMS HE DISCOVERED BOTH WERE RUPTURED, ON THE FILMS. THEY WERE REMOVED AND REPLACED WITH SALINE IMPLANTS. BECAUSE THE FIRST IMPLANTS WERE HEAVY, THEY STRETCHED HER SKIN AND SHE WENT FROM A 34 B TO A 38 B-C BRA SIZE. SHE HAS SEEN SEVERAL RHEUMATOLOGISTS FOR CONTINUED PAIN, HAS GONE TO A PAIN CLINIC, AND TO MAYO CLINIC. THE PAIN NEVER LEAVES HER.

SHE NEVER FELT ANY BETTER. THEN IN EARLY 3/94, AFTER HER HUSBAND AND DR ENCOURAGED HER TO KEEP TRACK OF HER ACTIVITIES, SHE DISCOVERED THAT SEX WOULD SET OFF AN ATTACK. LIKEWISE, WEATHER CHANGES, ANY KIND OF STRESS (BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE), EXERCISE, GARDENING, VIGOROUS WALKING, ETC, CERTAIN FOODS, AND EVEN A MASSAGE APPEARED TO EXACERBATE THE SYMPTOMS. ACTING ON THIS DISCOVERY, SHE CONSULTED AN ENDOCRINOLOGIST WHO SPECIALIZES IN AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS AND 2 GYNECOLOGISTS ALL OF WHOM RECOMMENDED THAT RPTR SEES A PLASTIC SURGEON WHO IN TURN ORDERED AN ULTRASOUND OF THE BREASTS.

IN EARLY 1982 THE DOCTOR REMOVED THE IMPLANTS AND SHE BELIEVES HE SAID HE WOULD PLACE THE IMPLANTS UNDER THE BREAST MUSCLES TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM. THE SECOND OPERATION DID NOT CORRECT HER PAIN PROBLEM. SHE QUESTIONED THIS PAIN IN RELATION TO HER IMPLANTS WITH SEVERAL DOCTORS BUT THEY HAD NO ANSWER FOR THE PROBLEM.

314784|202369|D|1||"SINCE HAVING ""SOYA BEAN"" BREAST IMPLANTS, RPTR HAS BEEN HAVING PROBLEMS TWO YEARS AFTER THE IMPLANTS. CHRONIC TIREDNESS, DOUBLE VISION AND DIPLOPIA. RPTR HAS NOW BEEN UNDER SEVERAL NEUROLOGISTS WHO ARE TESTING THEM FOR AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES. ALL RESULTS CAME BACK NEGATIVE. DURING THESE TESTS BREAST IMPLANTS WERE RECALLED. RPTR HAD THEM REMOVED IN 1999. RPTR HAS FELT A SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT IN HEALTH IN THE SHORT 6 WEEKS THAT HAVE FOLLOWED. HOWEVER, RPTR HAS HAD THEM REPLACED WITH SILICONE COHESIVE GEL IMPLANTS. RPTR IS EXPECTING A RECOVERY TO TAKE PLACE FOR A FEW MONTHS. HOWEVER RPTR FEELS THEY MAY ALSO GET SYMPTOMS FROM THE NEW ONES DUE TO AN EVIDENCE THAT IT IS ACTUALLY THE SILICONE BAG WHICH DISINTEGRATES SLIGHTLY AND SENDS SILICA AROUND YOUR BODY. RPTR RECKONS THIS MAY TAKE UP TO 2 YEARS. AT THE FIRST SIGN OF CHRONIC TIREDNESS ETC - AS BAD AS RPTR WAS AT FIRST, BEFORE THE REMOVAL RPTR WILL HAVE THEM COMPLETELY REMOVED. RPTR IMAGINES A DEFORMED BREAST MUCH SMALLER, STRETCHED AND DISFIGURED WILL BE LEFT BEHIND. WHAT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF THIS WILL BE THEY DON'T KNOW. RPTR DOES KNOW IT CAN'T BE WORSE THAN WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH SINCE THE ONSET OF SYMPTOMS. IF IT WILL IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH HAVING THEM COMPLETELY REMOVED, RPTR WILL DO IT. RPTR SUGGESTS NEW STUDIES ARE CARRIED OUT TO STOP ALL IMPLANTS MADE WITH A SILICONE BAG, DESPITE WHAT THEY CONTAIN. RPTR THINKS THE ONLY TRUE WAY TO DO THIS IS STUDIES ON NEUROSURGEONS PTS. THESE ARE THE GUYS WHO GET TO SEE RPTR'S COMPLICATIONS FIRST. RPTR THINKS ALL PTS SEEING A NEUROLOGIST SHOULD BE ASKED IF THEY HAVE IMPLANTS. RPTR'S NEVER ASKED THEM. AT LAST VISIT RPTR TOLD HIM THEY HAD THEM REMOVED AND FELT A SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT. HE COMPLETELY IGNORED THIS FACT AND DIDN'T EVEN WRITE A NOTE ON IT. RPTR FEELS THIS IGNORANCE SHOULD BE STOPPED. ALL NEUROSURGEONS SHOULD BE LOOKING OUT FOR THE COMMON SYMPTOMS WHEN A PT IN HIS CARE HAS IMPLANTS. RPTR HAS KEPT THE IMPLANTS. THEY ARE WHAT THEY CAN ONLY DESCRIBE AS ""RANCID"". THE SILICONE ELASTOMER SHELL HAD DISINTEGRATED AND BITS ARE FLAYED ALL OVER IT. IT'S OBVIOUS THAT IT HAS BEEN BREAKING OFF INTO BODY CAUSING IMMUNE SYSTEM REACTIONS.

928432|17396559|D|1||WAS IMPLANTED IN 1987 WITH MENTOR SMOOTH SALINE IMPLANTS. I WAS TOLD, THEY WOULD LAST A LIFETIME AND THEY WERE COMPLETELY SAFE. OVER THE YEARS, I WAS BECOMING SICK WITH FATIGUE, PAIN, ARRHYTHMIA. I HAVE BEEN TO MANY, MANY DOCTORS. I HAVE EVERYTHING TESTED. ALL TESTS COME UP NEGATIVE. IN 2006, I STARTED TO FEEL VERY ILL. I FELT AS THOUGH MY BODY WAS SHUTTING DOWN. I WAS SPENDING MOST OF MY DAYS OFF FROM WORK IN BED. A NEW DR FOUND A VERY HIGH ANA. I WAS SENT TO A RHEUMATOLOGIST. BY THAT TIME I HAD COMPLETE NUMBNESS DOWN THE LEFT SIDE OF MY BODY. CHEST WALL PAIN AND BURNING, COMPLETE BODY PAIN AND STIFFNESS. I COULD NO LONGER STAND UP. EVERY POSSIBLE TEST CAME BACK NEGATIVE. I WAS TOLD MY IMPLANTS MIGHT BE THE PROBLEM. I DID RESEARCH. I FOUND ALL KINDS OF HEALTH CLAIMS, ALL SYMPTOMS MATCHED MINE. I SPOKE TO A DR WHO TOLD ME IF I DID NOT TAKE MY IMPLANTS OUT, I COULD DIE. LATE IN THE SAME YEAR, I WAS EXPLAINED. MY IMPLANTS CAME OUT COMPLETELY BLACK. I HAD THEM TESTED AND FUNGUS WAS FOUND IN THEM. I HAVE READ THAT MENTOR WAS AWARE OF THESE ISSUES WITH SALINE IMPLANTS. WHY WASN'T I EVER NOTIFIED!? WHEN THERE IS A DEFECT ON AN AUTOMOBILE, YOU GET A RECALL NOTICE. THIS IS MY HEALTH. IT IS NOW IN 2007, AND I AM STILL NOT WELL. I SPENT SEVEN MONTHS IN BED DEATHLY ILL. MANY SYMPTOMS HAVE ABATED BUT I AM STILL VERY SICK. I NO LONGER HAVE NUMBNESS, CHEST WALL BURNING, BREAST PAIN, BURNING SCALP, EXTREME NERVOUSNESS, OR RACING HEART. BUT, I AM STILL VERY WEAK, OVERALL FEELING OF BEING SICK, PAIN ALL OVER MY BODY, AND STIFFNESS. I HAVE NEVER BEEN SICK BEFORE IMPLANTS IN MY LIFE. I HAVE ALWAYS LED AN EXTREMELY ACTIVE AND HEALTHY LIFESTYLE. I KNOW THERE IS NO TEST TO PROVE THAT MY IMPLANTS MADE ME SICK. BUT, I KNOW THAT THEY DID! I AM BEGGING YOU, THE FDA, TO URGE THAT MORE TESTING BE DONE IN THESE IMPLANTS!!! I WORK IN A BUSINESS HERE SO MANY AT A YOUNG AGE ARE IMPLANTING THEMSELVES BELIEVING THAT THERE ARE NO HEALTH RISKS INVOLVED. WHEN WILL IT BE ILLEGAL FOR SURGEONS TO NOT DIVULGE PERTINENT INFO TO A PT, SO THEY CAN MAKE AN INFORMED CHOICE. WHERE DOES THE FDA'S RESPONSIBILITY LIE IN PROTECTING THE CONSUMER? HOW MANY HAVE TO BECOME SICK FOR THINGS TO CHANGE? I HAVE BEEN TO SURGEONS WHO DO ADMIT THAT MANY HAVE BECOME ILL FROM BREAST IMPLANTS. I AM REQUESTING A RESPONSE FROM YOU REGARDING THIS SERIOUS ISSUE. DATES OF USE: 1987 - 2006.

INITIAL CLINICAL PRESENTATION (B)(6) 2010. THIS IS (B)(6) FEMALE WITH A HISTORY OF DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU OF THE LEFT BREAST DIAGNOSED IN 1998. SHE SUBSEQUENTLY UNDERWENT A LEFT MASTECTOMY WHERE THE SPECIMEN WEIGHT WAS 596 GRAMS. SHE UNDERWENT IMMEDIATE RECONSTRUCTION WITH PLACEMENT OF SUBMUSCULAR TISSUE EXPANDER BY PLASTIC SURGEON #1. THE TISSUE EXPANDER WAS PLACED COMPLETELY SUBPECTORAL AND ALSO IN A SUBSERRATUS POCKET. THE EXPANDER WAS REMOVED IN 1999 AND REPLACED WITH A MCGHAN 440 ML DUAL-CHAMBER SILICONE AND SALINE-FILLED IMPLANT. SHE RECEIVED NO POSTOPERATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY OR RADIATION THERAPY. WITHIN A YEAR, SHE DEVELOPED SIGNIFICANT HARDENING AND DISTORTION OF THE LEFT RECONSTRUCTED BREAST WITH GRADUAL ELEVATION OF THE IMPLANT, TIGHTENING OF THE TISSUE AROUND THE IMPLANT, AND DISCOMFORT IN THE LEFT CHEST WALL. SHE WAS SEEN IN EVALUATION IN 2006 BY PLASTIC SURGEON #2, WHO RE-OPERATED ON HER LEFT BREAST AND REMOVED THE EXISTING IMPLANT, PERFORMED PERIPROSTHETIC CAPSULOTOMIES WHICH WERE NOT SPECIFIED IN THE OPERATIVE NOTE, SUBMITTED CAPSULAR TISSUE FOR HISTOLOGIC EXAMINATION (INTERPRETED AS NEGATIVE) AND REPLACED A SMALLER SALINE IMPLANT. THIS WAS AN ALLERGAN-STYLE 68MP SALINE IMPLANT, SIZE 390-420 ML. THIS RECONSTRUCTION WAS SOFT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, BUT WITHIN 1 YEAR, SHE HAD RECURRENCE OF THE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE WITH TIGHTENING OF THE TISSUE AROUND THE IMPLANT, GRADUAL ELEVATION OF THE IMPLANT LOCATION, AND DISCOMFORT IN THE LEFT CHEST WALL. SHE WAS SEEN IN EVALUATION IN 2009 BY PLASTIC SURGEON #4 WHO RECOMMENDED THAT SHE CONSIDER REVISION OF HER RECONSTRUCTION WITH THE ADDITION OF AN CELLULAR DERMAL MATRIX TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR RECURRENCE OF HER CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE AROUND THE DEVICE. PLASTIC SURGEON #4 ALSO RECOMMENDED AUTOLOGOUS ABDOMINAL FLAP RECONSTRUCTION PROCEDURES. THE PT WAS INTERESTED IN CONSIDERING A DIEP FLAP AND PLASTIC SURGEON #4 REFERRED HER TO ME ((B)(6) SURGEON #5) FOR EVALUATION AND CONSIDERATION OF A FREE FLAP BREAST RECONSTRUCTION PROCEDURE. THE PT'S PAST MEDICAL HISTORY WAS ADDITIONALLY SIGNIFICANT FOR A HISTORY OF HYPOTHYROIDISM AND BLADDER PROLAPSE. HER MEDICATIONS INCLUDED SYNTHROID 88 MCG DAILY, VITAMIN D, AND ADVIL. SHE IS A NONSMOKER AND DRINKS ALCOHOL RARELY. INITIAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION, (B)(6) 2010, SHOWED THE PT WAS 155 CM TALL, 70.3 KG. THE LEFT BREAST WAS ABSENT THROUGH A TRANSVERSE STEWART-TYPE MASTECTOMY INCISION. THERE WAS AN IMPLANT PRESENT IN THE SUBPECTORAL POSITION ON THE LEFT SIDE. THERE WAS A BAKER GRADE IV CAPSULE CONTRACTURE AROUND THIS DEVICE, WHICH WAS RIGIDLY AFFIXED TO HER CHEST WALL AND SOMEWHAT TENDER TO MANIPULATION. THE WOUNDS WERE WELL HEALED WITH NO EVIDENCE OF SCAR HYPERTROPHY. THE RIGHT BREAST WAS MORE PTOTIC WITH A DEGREE OF PSEUDOPTOSIS, LATERAL BOTTOMING OUT AND A WISE-PATTERN SCAR FROM PREVIOUS MASTOPEXY - RESULTING IN SUBSTANTIAL SHAPE AND VOLUME ASYMMETRY. ON THE LEFT SIDE, THE STERNAL NOTCH TO INFRAMAMMARY FOLD DISTANCE WAS 20 CM. ON THE RIGHT SIDE, THE STERNAL NOTCH TO INFRAMAMMARY FOLD DISTANCE WAS 23 CM. THE MID-CLAVICULAR POINT TO NIPPLE DISTANCE ON THE RIGHT WAS 21 CM. EXAMINATION OF THE ABDOMEN SHOWED A GENEROUS AMOUNT OF TISSUE IN THE LOWER 1/3 OF THE ABDOMEN FOR ABDOMINAL FLAP CONSIDERATION. INITIAL IMPRESSION, (B)(6) 2010. THIS WAS A (B)(6) FEMALE WITH RECURRENT CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE FOLLOWING 2 PREVIOUS IMPLANT-BASED RECONSTRUCTION SURGERIES ON THE LEFT SIDE. THE LEFT BREAST RECONSTRUCTION SHOWED ELEVATION OF THE INFRAMAMMARY FOLD AND A SEVERE CAPSULAR CONTRACTURE AROUND THE EXISTING IMPLANT. I RECOMMENDED REMOVAL OF THE EXISTING LEFT BREAST IMPLANT, RECONSTRUCTION OF THE ORIGINS OF THE LEFT PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE AND RECONSTRUCTION OF THE LEFT BREAST WITH A FREE ABDOMINAL FLAP. OPERATIVE FINDINGS ON (B)(6) 2011: THE LEFT BREAST IMPLANT CAPSULE WAS OPENED AND CONTAINED A CLOUDY YELLOW FLUID UNDER ENORMOUS PRESSURE, THE FLUID SQUIRTED OUT OF THE CAPSULAR INCISION AND TRAVELED AT LEAST 56 INCHES. THERE WAS A COLLECTION OF GELATINOUS MATERIAL WITHIN THE CAPSULE AS WELL AS AN INTACT SALINE BREAST IMPLANT. THE CAPSULE WAS THICKENED AND COVERED WITH PLAQUE-LIKE LESIONS INTERNALLY. A TOTAL CAPSULECTOMY WAS PERFORMED, THE PECTORALIS MAJOR MUSCLE WAS REATTACHED TO ITS 5TH RIB ORIGINS. THE PERIPROSTHETIC FLUID WAS CAPTURED, AND ALL MATERIAL WAS SENT FOR PATHOLOGIC AND CYTOLOGIC EVALUATION INCLUDING FROZEN SECTION WHICH WAS CONSISTENT WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF ALCL. THE REMAINING RECONSTRUCTION WAS ABANDONED PENDING FINAL PATHOLOGY EVALUATION SPECIMEN. DETAILED PATHOLOGY FINDINGS: LEFT BREAST PERI-PROSTHETIC MATERIAL. LARGE ATYPICAL CELLS PRESENT, MOST CONSISTENT WITH INVOLVEMENT BY ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA IMPLANT, LEFT BREAST IMPLANT CAPSULE, INVOLVEMENT BY ANAPLASTIC LARGE CELL LYMPHOMA.

I WENT BACK TO HER LATE (B)(6) AND SHE HAD GIVEN ME A STEROID SHOT WHICH HAD HELPED FOR AWHILE. THE FIRST WEEK OF (B)(6) 2010, I BEGAN TO HAVE SHORTNESS OF BREATH AND FELT IT WAS MORE THAN JUST MY ASTHMA. I ALSO HAD VERY BAD LOWER BACK AND STOMACH PAIN. I WENT TO SEE DR.

HE PUT ME ON ANTIBIOTICS, TOOK ME OFF OF WORK AND GAVE ME A FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENT. I REALLY NEVER FELT BETTER SO WENT BACK ABOUT 1 WEEK LATER AND HE NOTICED THE FLUID HAD GOTTEN WORSE. HE CONTACTED A PULMONARY SPECIALIST AT (B)(6) HOSPITAL IN (B)(6). DR (B)(6). I HAD THE FLUID REMOVED AND FELT MUCH BETTER FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS. MY WHITE BLOOD COUNTS WERE VERY HIGH 11,000 TO 22,000 DURING THIS TIME. THE FLUID CAME BACK IN EARLY (B)(6) AND I WAS SEEN AT (B)(6) EMERGENCY ROOM AGAIN TO HAVE THE FLUID REMOVED AND TO BE ADMITTED.

2163607|2106125|D|1||"I'M WRITING MY STORY TO THE FDA. THIS IS ABOUT MY BREAST SILICONE IMPLANTS THAT HAVE BEEN BLEEDING OUT FOR 7 OR MORE YEARS. I STARTED TO CONTINUALLY TO BE SICK WITH SYMPTOMS LIKE: LOW GRADE FEVERS 99.6 TO 100.8 (ALL THE TIME), FATIGUE, SWOLLEN LYMPH NODES, FLU-LIKE SYMPTOMS, NIGHT SWEATS, INSOMNIA, BACKACHES, WEIGHT LOSS, WEIGHT GAIN, BONES HURTING, CANKER SORES IN MY MOUTH FOR 4 MONTHS AND ON AND OFF FOR 2 YEARS, LARGE SUB LINGUAL TONSILS, COUGHING, WEAKNESS, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, CHEST PAINS, PAIN DEEP IN THE BONES, MEMORY LOSS. UNTIL (B)(6) 2007, WHEN MY BLOOD PRESSURE WENT UP AND I STARTED GETTING CHEST PAINS, THEN I SAW MY CARDIOLOGIST. HE RAN ALL THE TESTS, ECHO, THALLIUM TREADMILL AND BP MONITOR WITH BLOOD TESTS. ALL THE TESTS CAME BACK NEGATIVE EXCEPT FOR MY CRP, IT WAS 20.6. THIS HAD MY CARDIOLOGIST CONCERNED. HE ASKED THAT I RETURNED IN 2 MONTHS FOR A REPEAT TEST TO SEE IF IT WAS STILL HIGH 20.1. IN (B)(6), THE TEST WAS REPEATED WITH THE SAME RESULT 20.1. SENT ME FOR A CHEST CT SCAN. CAME BACK ABNORMAL AGAIN. MY CT SHOWED MANY SPOTS WITH INFILTRATES IN BOTH LUNGS AND PATCHY SPOTS WITH ABNORMAL LYMPH NODES. HE REFERRED ME TO A PULMONOLOGIST; SHE SAID I NEED A LYMPH NODE BIOPSY IN MY AXILLARY'S NODES, WANTED TO R/O LYMPHOMA. SHE HAD MORE BLOOD TEST DONE AND MY CPR WAS UP TO 43 AND SED RATE WAS UP, WBC WAS UP, BLOOD WORK IS STARTING TO COME BACK ABNORMAL. SHE REFERRED ME TO A GENERAL SURGEON TO PERFORM THE BIOPSY AND THE BIOPSY CAME BACK SHOWING SILICONE IN THE LYMPH NODES AND ALSO IN MY MEDIA-STERNUM FROM THE LAST BIOPSY. THE DOCTORS ARE NOW SAYING THIS HAS BEEN LEAKING INTO SYSTEM SLOWLY SINCE BEFORE 2004 AND MY AUTOIMMUNE SYSTEM HAS BEEN FIGHTING, WHICH IS WHY I HAVE BEEN SO SICK. WELL, THE 1ST SURGERY WAS ON (B)(6) 2007. THE INCISIONS ARE ABOUT 3IN ON BOTH SIDE OF MY PELVIC AREA. THIS SURGERY WILL BE DIVIDING THE INFERIOR EPIGASTRIC BLOOD VESSELS, TRAINING THE TRAM TISSUES TO RELY ON THE SUPERIOR EPIGASTRIC SYSTEM. THIS STEP IS NOT REQUIRED FOR SUCCESSFUL PEDICLE TRAM RECONSTRUCTION BUT CAN IMPROVE BLOOD SUPPLY TO THE FLAP. SO-CALLED DELAY PROCEDURES MAY EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY OF PERFORMING MICROSURGERY (""SUPERCHARGING"") IF THE PEDICLE FLAP HAS ANY ARTERIAL OR VENOUS INSUFFICIENCY PROBLEMS, SINCE THE VESSELS DIVIDED IN THE ""DELAY"" CANNOT BE USED. IT IS INFECTING MY LUNGS AND IMMUNE SYSTEM AND OTHER MAJOR ORGANS. IN ALL I HAD A MINIMUM OF 13 MAJOR SURGERIES WHICH INCLUDE MORE RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY AND WOUND CARE, DEVELOP NECROSIS FROM THE SURGERY, ALL THE SILICONE COULD NOT BE REMOVED. I HAD DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH AND THERE IS VERY LITTLE ABOUT MY CONDITION AND SILICONE ILLNESS. BOTH THE SURGEON AND PLASTIC SURGEON HAVE SAID THIS IS A VERY RARE CONDITION. ON (B)(6) 2007, BILATERAL PEDICLES TRAM FLAP WITH THE REMOVAL OF SILICONE IMPLANTS. BOTH IMPLANTS WERE RUPTURED AND BLEEDING OUT, MORE ON THE LEFT THEN ON THE RIGHT SIDE. BUT THE PLASTIC SURGEON -PS- SAID THESE HAVE BEEN LEAKING FOR A LONG TIME. THE PS CLEANED ALL THE AREA WHILE NOT TO DISTURB THE BLOOD VESSEL FOR THE TRAM FLAPS. THE PS USED THE SKIN OF THE BREASTS FROM WHERE HE REMOVED THE IMPLANTS AND TRANSPLANTED THE FLAPS BILATERALLY TO KEEP ME THE SAME SIZE AND SYMMETRICALLY. THE ABDOMEN REPAIR ""TUMMY TUCK"". THERE HAS BEEN SOME BRUISING AROUND THE ""NEW PLACEMENT"" OF THE BELLY BUTTON AND ABDOMEN AROUND THERE. THE PS USED MESH FOR MY ABDOMEN INSTEAD OF ALLODERM, BECAUSE THE MESH WAS STRONGER. I CAN FEEL THAT MESH WHEN I WALK. I WAS IN SURGERY FOR 8 1/2 HOURS AND SUFFERED RESPIRATORY FAILURE WITH PULMONARY EDEMA WITHIN THE FIRST 24 HOURS. I WAS MOVED TO THE FLOOR AND DEVELOPED PNEUMONIA IN THE RIGHT LOWER LOBE. I SWEAR, I WAS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT BASED ON BREATHING. ANTIBIOTICS PUSH AND LASIX PUSH AND PLENTY OF RESPIRATORY THERAPY, WHEN I GOT HOME I HAD EXTRA EQUIPMENT OXYGEN, WALKER, AND HOSPITAL BED. I WAS ON A LOT OF ANTIBIOTICS AND PAIN PILLS. I WENT TO THE DOCTOR AND IT LOOKS LIKE I'M GOING TO BE ADMITTED BACK INTO THE HOSPITAL ON (B)(6) 2008 FOR MORE SURGERY FOR A WOUND THAT DEVELOPED IN THE ABDOMEN. THE SURGERY IS FOR DEBRIDEMENT OF THE WOUND THAT IS NOT HEALING AND PLACING A WOUND VAC ON IT. THE DOCTOR WILL HAVE TO REDO 8 INCHES OF THE INCISION. I WILL BE IN THE HOSPITAL FOR 2-3 DAYS; I WILL HAVE TO PRAY MORE. THE SURGERY IS SUPPOSED TO TAKE 1 TO 1 1/2 HOUR; WITH THE COMPLICATIONS OF MY LUNGS THAT TIME SHOULDN'T BE TOO BAD. I WAS AFRAID OF DEVELOPING INFECTION, (B)(6). THEN 6 WEEKS OF THE WOUND VAC ON MY ABDOMEN. I DID DEVELOP (B)(6) AND WAS HOSPITALIZE FOR 4 MONTHS IN 2008. I HAVE STARTED TO SEE THE TRANSPLANTATION TEAM TO HAVE A POSSIBLE LUNG REMOVED BEFORE I RUN OUT OF TIME. BOTH LUNGS ARE FILLED WITH SILICONE, AS WELL AS MY KIDNEYS, AND MY GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT. MY PULMONARY DOCTOR I HAVE HAS BEEN WITH ME FOR 4 YEARS, AND SHE HAS SEEN ME GET WORSE THROUGH ON-GOING TESTS AND YEARS. WITH THE LUNG BIOPSIES (B)(6) 2011, SHOWING SILICONE THROUGHOUT MY LUNGS, SHE THEN SAW MY LAST PFTS AND IT WAS WORSE BY 80% SINCE (B)(6) 2011, AND MY O2 LEVEL IS AT 7 LITERS NOW. IT HAS GONE UP BY 3 LITERS SINCE (B)(6) 2010. SO CURRENTLY, I AM GOING THROUGH THE PRE-TESTING FOR LUNG TRANSPLANTS TO SEE IF I QUALIFY FOR THE TRANSPLANTS. SO I HAVE TO GO THROUGH A LOT OF TESTING TO SEE IF MY BODY CAN HANDLE THE TRANSPLANTS. ONLY MY DOCTOR UNDERSTANDS EVERYTHING ABOUT WHAT IMPLANTS CAN DO TO YOU. SHE HAS SEEN ME GO THROUGH IT A LOT. WHEN MY IMPLANTS WERE REMOVED IN 2007, THE DOCTOR HAD TO LEAVE THE OUTER PART IN BECAUSE MY TISSUE WAS ALREADY TAKEN OVER. MY IMPLANTS HAD BEEN LEAKING UP TO 7 YEARS PER THE TIMELINE OF ALL THE ISSUE WITH MY HEALTH PER MY DOCTORS. I HOPE THE LUNG TRANSPLANTS WILL BE APPROVE TO PLACE ME ON THE ORGAN TRANSPLANT LIST. SILICONE IMPLANTS SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL MORE AND NEW UPDATED RESEARCH IS DONE. PLEASE, I BEG YOU TO LISTEN."|MENTOR||07/11/2011||12/04/2007||R|||0|FTR|1.0||BREAST IMPLANTS|||||||MENTOR|||||MENTOR||True

2873439|3183259|D|1||"I HAD LEFT NIPPLE SPARING MASTECTOMY, SENTINEL LYMPH NODE BIOPSY AND LEFT IMMEDIATE BREAST RECONSTRUCTION DONE ON (B)(6) 2012. SURGERY WAS UNEVENTFUL, I HAD HUGE SWELLING UPPER LEFT BREAST AREA POST SURGERY. I WAS DISCHARGED THE NEXT DAY WITH 2 BREAST DRAINS AND INSTRUCTED TO FOLLOW-UP WITH SURGEON. I FOLLOWED UP WITH MY PLASTIC SURGEON AT LEAST TWICE A WEEK. BREAST SURGERY WAS VERY PAINFUL. ON THIRD WEEK POST-SURGERY, I HAD SEVERAL MEDICAL COMPLAINTS: HEADACHE, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, NUMBNESS OF FACE, AND EVENTUALLY MOTTLING, REDNESS AND SWELLING OF LEFT BREAST, SWELLING ON PORT BELOW INTRA-MAMMARY FOLD. I HAD SEVERAL VISITS TO URGENT CARE, EMERGENCY HOSPITAL, AND DOCTORS' OFFICES. I DEVELOPED FEVER AND CELLULITIS ON BREAST; WHICH FELT LIKE A BALLOON. I WENT TO URGENT CARE ON (B)(6) 2012; WAS GIVEN VANCOMYCIN IV. THE NEXT DAY, I FELT THAT THE LEFT BREAST DEFLATED AND AREA AROUND PORT (INTRA-MAMMARY FOLD) FILLED WITH MORE FLUID. I SAW MY SURGEON WHO ORDERED ADMISSION TO HOSPITAL FOR SURGICAL EXPLANTATION, IRRIGATION, AND DEBRIDEMENT. SURGERY WAS PERFORMED ON THE NEXT DAY, (B)(6) 2012. CLOUDY SEROMA AND GRANULATION TISSUE WAS EVACUATED AND SALINE BREAST EXPANDER AND PORT WAS REMOVED. SAMPLES OF FLUID AND TISSUE WERE SUBMITTED FOR CULTURE AND SENSITIVITY TESTING, BUT NO HISTOPATHOLOGICAL SAMPLES WERE TAKEN. SHE SAID THAT THE IMPLANT WILL BE SUBMITTED FOR EXAMINATION AND THEN RETURNED TO MFR. I WAS GIVEN CONTINUOUS VANCOMYCIN TREATMENT FOR 2 DAYS AND WAS PRESCRIBED CIPRO AND ORAL PAIN MEDS. I HAD FOLLOW-UP VISITS AT HER OFFICE AND 2 DRAIN TUBES WERE REMOVED AFTER SEVERAL DAYS. THE INITIAL CULTURE TEST RESULTS AT (B)(6) CAME OUT AS ACID-FAST BACILLI, A FAST GROWER. I SAW AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR FOR EMPIRICAL TREATMENT WHILE WAITING FOR SENSITIVITY TESTING RESULTS. I STARTED WITH A COMBINATION TREATMENT OF CLARITHROMYCIN AND DOXYCYCLINE. THE TREATMENT WAS CONCURRED BY MY CURRENT INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR AT (B)(6) HOSPITAL. THE SAMPLE WAS SENT TO (B)(6) FOR FURTHER IDENTIFICATION AND SENSITIVITY TESTING. RESULTS OF THE TEST IDENTIFIED AS M. FORTUITUM, SENSITIVE TO CLARITHROMYCIN, BUT RESISTANT TO DOXYCYCLINE. MY INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR, REPLACED THE DOXYCYCLINE TO CIPRO IN COMBINATION WITH CLARITHROMYCIN. I FINALLY CONSULTED WITH (B)(6); WELL KNOWN EXPERTS IN DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF MYCOBACTERIAL INFECTIONS. I WANTED TO GET A ""DEFINITE REGARDING CAUSE"" OF PERSISTENT FIBRINOUS NODULAR TISSUE ON MY LEFT BREAST AND AXILLA. I FINALLY SAW AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE DOCTOR, WHO THEN PRESENTED MY CASE FOR REVIEW AT THEIR DEPARTMENT STAFF MEETING. ASSESSMENT WAS POSSIBLE MYCOBACTERIUM FORTUITUM IATROGENIC HEALTH CARE ASSOCIATED INFECTION OF THE LEFT BREAST IMPLANT. BECAUSE OF ABSENCE OF PERI-OPERATIVE PATHOLOGY TO LOOK FOR GRANULOMAS, NOR ABILITY TO RE-CULTURE THE SITE, PLAN WAS TO GET MRI OF RESIDUAL BREAST TISSUE AND CONSULT WITH SURGEON WHO SPECIALIZED IN MYCOBACTERIAL INFECTIONS. MRI RESULTS: SOME ABNORMAL FINDINGS, BUT COULD NOT RULE OUT IF THIS IS DUE TO INFECTIOUS DISEASE OR POST-SURGICAL CHANGES. I SAW A SURGEON AT (B)(6). SHE CONCURRED WITH (B)(6) TREATMENT OF 6 MONTHS ANTIBIOTICS AND RETURN APPOINTMENT FOR REASSESSMENT IN 3 MONTHS. ANTIBIOTIC COMBINATION WERE PRESCRIBED, CHANGED FROM TIME TO TIME TO PREVENT BACTERIAL RESISTANCE AND SIDE EFFECTS. ON THE LAST FEW WEEKS OF TREATMENT, I WAS SWITCHED TO TAKING SULFISOXAZOLE/TRIMETHOPRIM ALONE BECAUSE I WAS NOT ABLE TO TOLERATE THE SIDE EFFECTS FROM AVELOX, CIPRO, ETC. ON (B)(6) 2012, I HAD A RETURN DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT AND MRI AND BLOOD TEST AT (B)(6). SURGEON'S ASSESSMENT WAS THAT I HAVE NO APPARENT LESION OF MYCOBACTERIAL DISEASE.

I HAVE BEEN ON DISABILITY FOR FIBROMYALGIA FOR SEVERAL YEARS. I AM SCHEDULED TO HAVE THESE TOXIC IMPLANTS REMOVED BUT IT WILL COST ME ALMOST(B)(6) WITH NO INSURANCE HELP. I ORIGINALLY MADE THE DECISION TO HAVE IMPLANTS BECAUSE FDA AND MY DOCTORS SAID THEY WERE TOTALLY SAFE. I HAVE NEVER SMOKED (NOT EVEN ONE PUFF). I EAT MY GARDEN RAISED WHOLE FOODS (I AM (B)(6)), AND I TAKE NO MEDS AND HAVE NEVER DONE ANY DRUGS. PEOPLE SMOKE AND OVER EAT KNOWING THEY RISK HEART DISEASE, DIABETES, CANCER, ETC., AND INSURANCE STILL PAYS FOR THEIR TREATMENT.

I HAVE ALWAYS STRONGLY SUPPORTED MY WONDERFUL GOVERNMENT AND MY HEART IS BROKEN THAT I HAVE BEEN WRONG. THE RESEARCH YOU AND OTHERS HAVE DONE ARE SO LIMITED AND FLAWED. YOU HAVE CONVINCED DOCTORS THAT IMPLANT RELATED HEALTH ISSUES ARE NOT A PROBLEM AND SO THEREFORE WHEN WOMEN LIKE ME TRY TO GET OUR DOCTORS TO INVESTIGATE THE POSSIBILITY, WE ARE DISMISSED AND TOLD OUR SYMPTOMS ARE EITHER ""IN OUR HEADS"" OR ARE CAUSED BY A VIRUS OR STRESS SO WE SHOULD JUST GO HOME AND RELAX. THE LOSS OF CONFIDENCE AND TRUST IN MY GOVERNMENT IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE WORST PROBLEM WITH THIS ISSUE. I AM SO SAD AND DEPRESSED. I DO UNDERSTAND WHY THERE IS SUCH A HIGH DEGREE OF SUICIDE BY WOMEN WITH IMPLANT PROBLEMS. MY QUALITY OF LIFE IS AT ROCK BOTTOM AFTER 30 YEARS OF TEACHING SECONDARY EDUCATION IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM AND LOOKING FORWARD TO MY RETIREMENT YEARS. ALL MY RESOURCES WILL NOW HAVE TO BE USED TO PAY DOCTORS AND I JUST PRAY THAT THEY DO NOT FIND ALCL. I JUST READ THAT INSURANCE WILL NOT PAY FOR THAT CANCER TREATMENT EITHER AND SO IF I HAVE IT, I WILL JUST NOT BE ABLE TO GET TREATMENT. THIS IS JUST WRONG THAT MY GOVERNMENT ALLOWS THIS TO HAPPEN TO WOMEN WHO HAD IMPLANTS DURING A TIME THAT WE WERE TOLD THEY WERE TOTALLY SAFE. IN 1990, I DID THE RESEARCH AND I BELIEVED YOU (FDA) THAT I WAS MAKING A SAFE DECISION. I JUST WANTED MY HUSBAND TO BE PROUD OF ME. SO SAD AND HEART BROKEN, WHAT IS THE TEST FOR THAT!!

I HAD A LEAK (CONTAINED WITHIN THE ENCAPSULATED AREA.) ABOUT 5 YEARS LATER. ON (B)(6), 2014, I HAD A MAMMOGRAM THAT SHOWS A PROGRESSIVE LEAK OUTSIDE THE ENCAPSULATION. I HAD THIS TEST BECAUSE OF RECENT UNEXPLAINED HEALTH ISSUES, PAIN AND WEIGHT LOSS. FOR 20 YEARS, I HAVE EXPERIENCED NUMEROUS AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS AND OTHER HEALTH ISSUES WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN (I ALWAYS ASK MY DOCTORS IF IT COULD BE CAUSED FROM MY SILICONE IMPLANTS AND THEY ALWAYS SAID IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE). I HAVE BEEN ON DISABILITY FOR FIBROMYALGIA FOR SEVERAL YEARS. I AM SCHEDULED TO HAVE THESE TOXIC IMPLANTS REMOVED BUT IT WILL COST ME ALMOST(B)(6) WITH NO INSURANCE HELP. I ORIGINALLY MADE THE DECISION TO HAVE IMPLANTS BECAUSE FDA AND MY DOCTORS SAID THEY WERE TOTALLY SAFE. I HAVE NEVER SMOKED (NOT EVEN ONE PUFF). I EAT MY GARDEN RAISED WHOLE FOODS (I AM (B)(6)), AND I TAKE NO MEDS AND HAVE NEVER DONE ANY DRUGS. PEOPLE SMOKE AND OVER EAT KNOWING THEY RISK HEART DISEASE, DIABETES, CANCER, ETC., AND INSURANCE STILL PAYS FOR THEIR TREATMENT. I AM NOW HAVING TO USE ALL THE MONEY I HAVE SAVED AND ARE SELLING FAMILY HEIRLOOMS TO PAY FOR THE TREATMENT I MUST HAVE, BECAUSE I TRUSTED THE FDA. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE FDA RECOMMENDS REMOVING LEAKING SILICONE IMPLANTS IF THERE IS NO HEALTH PROBLEMS FROM SILICONE IMPLANTS! I HAVE ALWAYS STRONGLY SUPPORTED MY WONDERFUL GOVERNMENT AND MY HEART IS BROKEN THAT I HAVE BEEN WRONG. THE RESEARCH YOU AND OTHERS HAVE DONE ARE SO LIMITED AND FLAWED. YOU HAVE CONVINCED DOCTORS THAT IMPLANT RELATED HEALTH ISSUES ARE NOT A PROBLEM AND SO THEREFORE WHEN WOMEN LIKE ME TRY TO GET OUR DOCTORS TO INVESTIGATE THE POSSIBILITY, WE ARE DISMISSED AND TOLD OUR SYMPTOMS ARE EITHER ""IN OUR HEADS"" OR ARE CAUSED BY A VIRUS OR STRESS SO WE SHOULD JUST GO HOME AND RELAX. THE LOSS OF CONFIDENCE AND TRUST IN MY GOVERNMENT IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE WORST PROBLEM WITH THIS ISSUE. I AM SO SAD AND DEPRESSED. I DO UNDERSTAND WHY THERE IS SUCH A HIGH DEGREE OF SUICIDE BY WOMEN WITH IMPLANT PROBLEMS. MY QUALITY OF LIFE IS AT ROCK BOTTOM AFTER 30 YEARS OF TEACHING SECONDARY EDUCATION IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM AND LOOKING FORWARD TO MY RETIREMENT YEARS. ALL MY RESOURCES WILL NOW HAVE TO BE USED TO PAY DOCTORS AND I JUST PRAY THAT THEY DO NOT FIND ALCL. I JUST READ THAT INSURANCE WILL NOT PAY FOR THAT CANCER TREATMENT EITHER AND SO IF I HAVE IT, I WILL JUST NOT BE ABLE TO GET TREATMENT. THIS IS JUST WRONG THAT MY GOVERNMENT ALLOWS THIS TO HAPPEN TO WOMEN WHO HAD IMPLANTS DURING A TIME THAT WE WERE TOLD THEY WERE TOTALLY SAFE. IN 1990, I DID THE RESEARCH AND I BELIEVED YOU (FDA) THAT I WAS MAKING A SAFE DECISION. I JUST WANTED MY HUSBAND TO BE PROUD OF ME. SO SAD AND HEART BROKEN, WHAT IS THE TEST FOR THAT!! EVEN THOUGH I PAY MONTHLY INSURANCE PREMIUMS, THEY WOULDN'T PAY FOR THAT EITHER."|REPLICON SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT||08/28/2014|||||||0|FTR|1.0||SILICONE BREAST IMPLANT|||||||SURGITEK|||||NOT KNOWN||True

AFTER 4 YEARS, I NOTICED STRANGE SYMPTOMS WHICH I INITIALLY DID NOT ATTRIBUTE TO MY IMPLANTS. THESE STARTED MILDLY AND GREW INCREASINGLY WORSE OVER TIME: INSOMNIA, HEART ARRHYTHMIA, DRY EYES, DRY MOUTH, DRY HAIR, HAIR LOSS, EAR RINGING, WEIGHT GAIN, SKIN ITCHING, JOINT PAIN, BRAIN FOG, COLD HANDS/FEET, AND CHEST (RIB CAGE) PAIN. WHEN THE SYMPTOMS BEGAN, I WAS LIVING OVERSEAS AND DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO GOOD HEALTH CARE. UPON MY RETURN AND RESETTLEMENT BACK TO THE US, I BEGAN INVESTIGATING THE SYMPTOMS BY STARTING WITH MY NEPHROLOGIST ( I HAVE ONE CONGENITALLY SMALL KIDNEY) IN (B)(6) WHO RAN A PANEL OF LABS. HE ALSO REFERRED ME TO A CARDIOLOGIST. ALL OF THESE TESTS CAME BACK NEGATIVE OR NORMAL. I SAW MY PCP WHO RAN A SECOND PANEL OF LABS, ALL CAME BACK NEGATIVE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HIGH LDL CHOLESTEROL AND LOW VITAMIN D. SHE REFERRED ME TO SEE AN ENDOCRINOLOGIST AND CHANGE JOBS TO SOMETHING LESS STRESSFUL. I DID CHANGE JOBS TO SOMETHING WITH NO TRAVEL AND ALSO DID SEE AN ENDOCRINOLOGIST. MY LABS CAME BACK NORMAL EXCEPT FOR THE HIGH LDL, CHOLESTEROL FOR WHICH SHE STARTED ME ON SIMVASTATIN. SHE REFERRED ME TO A DERMATOLOGIST FOR THE HAIR DRYNESS/LOSS, WHO I DID SEE BUT RESULTS WERE INCONCLUSIVE WITHOUT A SCALP BIOPSY (WHICH I DON'T WANT). ON MY OWN, I ALSO SAW A RHEUMATOLOGIST THINKING THERE WAS SOMETHING MORE SERIOUS GOING ON. BY THIS POINT, I WAS EXHAUSTED AND THE JOINT PAIN WAS BECOMING UNBEARABLE TO THE POINT THAT I WAS CUTTING BACK ON MY HOBBIES AND OTHER ACTIVITIES. BUT THOSE RHEUMATOLOGY LABS ALSO CAME BACK INCONCLUSIVE THOUGH THE MD DID DIAGNOSE ME WITH FIBROMYALGIA BASED ON SYMPTOMOLOGY ALONE. I BEGAN RESEARCHING MY SYMPTOMS ONLINE TRYING TO MAKE ANY CONNECTIONS I COULD TO BIRTH CONTROL, HERNIA REPAIRS (ANYTHING IN MY MEDICAL HISTORY WHICH MAY HAVE CAUSED THE ISSUE). I FOUND AN ARTICLE WHICH SAID THE SILICONE IN A MIRENA IUD CAN IGNITE AN INFLAMMATORY AUTOIMMUNE RESPONSE. I DIDN'T HAVE A MIRENA IUD BUT I CONNECTED THE SILICONE NOTE TO MY IMPLANTS. I BEGAN RESEARCHING ILLNESS ASSOCIATED WITH SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. I DID FIND A FEW ARTICLES BY MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL (MOSTLY IN EUROPE) THAT INDICATED THAT THERE COULD BE A CONNECTION, BUT MOSTLY IT SEEMED THAT PHYSICIANS AND THE US MEDICAL COMMUNITY AT LARGE DEEMED THE DEVICES SAFE (THOUGH THERE WERE NO LONG-TERM STUDIES (>5 YEARS) THAT SUPPORTED THE DEVICES TO BE SAFE OVER TIME). BECAUSE I COULD FIND NO TRULY SUPPORTIVE, LONG-TERM SAFETY DATA, AND BECAUSE OF THE MASSIVE AMOUNT OF WOMEN WHO WERE REPORTING MY SAME EXACT SYMPTOMS ONLINE IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR BREAST IMPLANTS. I BECAME CERTAIN THERE WAS ALSO A CONNECTION BETWEEN MY IMPLANTS AND MY DEGRADING HEALTH. I BEGAN TO PANIC AS MY SYMPTOMS WERE CLEARLY WORSENING OVER TIME, AND IT SEEMED NO MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL COULD HELP ME. WITHIN 8 WEEKS OF READING ABOUT AND RESEARCHING BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESS/BREAST IMPLANT STUDIES. I HAD MY OWN IMPLANTS REMOVED ON (B)(6) 2016. THEY WERE FOUND TO BE INTACT. THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME IN A BAG BY MY PS AFTER EXPLANT. MY MOTHER AND I TOUCHED THEM AND HANDLED THEM BRIEFLY AFTER THE SURGERY. I THEN PUT THEM AWAY AND ONLY RECENTLY PULLED THEM OUT TO SHOW MY HUSBAND. THEY ARE NOW OVERED IN A SLIMY RESIDUE WHICH WAS NOT PRESENT AT THE TIME THEY WERE PROVIDED TO ME BACK IN MAY. I AM CONCERNED THAT THE IMPLANTS WERE SILENTLY LEAKING (OR OOZING) WHILE IMPLANTED DUE TO A NATURAL DEGRADATION OF THE SHELL OVER THE 7 YEARS. I HAD THEM IN MY BODY. I AM CERTAIN MY BODY, SPECIFICALLY MY AUTOIMMUNE SYSTEM, WAS RESPONDING TO THIS SLOW LEAK AND AS A RESULT, BECAME EXHAUSTED, TRIGGERING THE CASCADE OF SYMPTOMS THAT WORSENED OVER TIME. I BEGAN REPORTING SYMPTOMS TO MY NEPHROLOGIST IN 2014 AND WENT TO VARIOUS MD'S OVER THE NEXT 2 YEARS TRYING TO SOLVE THE RIDDLE OF MY POOR HEALTH. BESIDES A MINOR VITAMIN D ISSUE AND HIGH LDL CHOLESTEROL. THERE WAS NOTHING TO INDICATE I HAD AN AUTOIMMUNE DISORDER.

WHEN THE SYMPTOMS BEGAN, I WAS LIVING OVERSEAS AND DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO GOOD HEALTH CARE. UPON MY RETURN AND RESETTLEMENT BACK TO THE US, I BEGAN INVESTIGATING THE SYMPTOMS BY STARTING WITH MY NEPHROLOGIST ( I HAVE ONE CONGENITALLY SMALL KIDNEY) IN (B)(6) WHO RAN A PANEL OF LABS. HE ALSO REFERRED ME TO A CARDIOLOGIST. ALL OF THESE TESTS CAME BACK NEGATIVE OR NORMAL. I SAW MY PCP WHO RAN A SECOND PANEL OF LABS, ALL CAME BACK NEGATIVE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HIGH LDL CHOLESTEROL AND LOW VITAMIN D. SHE REFERRED ME TO SEE AN ENDOCRINOLOGIST AND CHANGE JOBS TO SOMETHING LESS STRESSFUL. I DID CHANGE JOBS TO SOMETHING WITH NO TRAVEL AND ALSO DID SEE AN ENDOCRINOLOGIST. MY LABS CAME BACK NORMAL EXCEPT FOR THE HIGH LDL, CHOLESTEROL FOR WHICH SHE STARTED ME ON SIMVASTATIN. SHE REFERRED ME TO A DERMATOLOGIST FOR THE HAIR DRYNESS/LOSS, WHO I DID SEE BUT RESULTS WERE INCONCLUSIVE WITHOUT A SCALP BIOPSY (WHICH I DON'T WANT). ON MY OWN, I ALSO SAW A RHEUMATOLOGIST THINKING THERE WAS SOMETHING MORE SERIOUS GOING ON. BY THIS POINT, I WAS EXHAUSTED AND THE JOINT PAIN WAS BECOMING UNBEARABLE TO THE POINT THAT I WAS CUTTING BACK ON MY HOBBIES AND OTHER ACTIVITIES. BUT THOSE RHEUMATOLOGY LABS ALSO CAME BACK INCONCLUSIVE THOUGH THE MD DID DIAGNOSE ME WITH FIBROMYALGIA BASED ON SYMPTOMOLOGY ALONE. I BEGAN RESEARCHING MY SYMPTOMS ONLINE TRYING TO MAKE ANY CONNECTIONS I COULD TO BIRTH CONTROL, HERNIA REPAIRS (ANYTHING IN MY MEDICAL HISTORY WHICH MAY HAVE CAUSED THE ISSUE). I FOUND AN ARTICLE WHICH SAID THE SILICONE IN A MIRENA IUD CAN IGNITE AN INFLAMMATORY AUTOIMMUNE RESPONSE. I DIDN'T HAVE A MIRENA IUD BUT I CONNECTED THE SILICONE NOTE TO MY IMPLANTS. I BEGAN RESEARCHING ILLNESS ASSOCIATED WITH SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS. I DID FIND A FEW ARTICLES BY MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL (MOSTLY IN EUROPE) THAT INDICATED THAT THERE COULD BE A CONNECTION, BUT MOSTLY IT SEEMED THAT PHYSICIANS AND THE US MEDICAL COMMUNITY AT LARGE DEEMED THE DEVICES SAFE (THOUGH THERE WERE NO LONG-TERM STUDIES (>5 YEARS) THAT SUPPORTED THE DEVICES TO BE SAFE OVER TIME). BECAUSE I COULD FIND NO TRULY SUPPORTIVE, LONG-TERM SAFETY DATA, AND BECAUSE OF THE MASSIVE AMOUNT OF WOMEN WHO WERE REPORTING MY SAME EXACT SYMPTOMS ONLINE IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR BREAST IMPLANTS. I BECAME CERTAIN THERE WAS ALSO A CONNECTION BETWEEN MY IMPLANTS AND MY DEGRADING HEALTH. I BEGAN TO PANIC AS MY SYMPTOMS WERE CLEARLY WORSENING OVER TIME, AND IT SEEMED NO MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL COULD HELP ME. WITHIN 8 WEEKS OF READING ABOUT AND RESEARCHING BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESS/BREAST IMPLANT STUDIES. I HAD MY OWN IMPLANTS REMOVED ON (B)(6) 2016. THEY WERE FOUND TO BE INTACT. THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME IN A BAG BY MY PS AFTER EXPLANT. MY MOTHER AND I TOUCHED THEM AND HANDLED THEM BRIEFLY AFTER THE SURGERY. I THEN PUT THEM AWAY AND ONLY RECENTLY PULLED THEM OUT TO SHOW MY HUSBAND. THEY ARE NOW OVERED IN A SLIMY RESIDUE WHICH WAS NOT PRESENT AT THE TIME THEY WERE PROVIDED TO ME BACK IN MAY. I AM CONCERNED THAT THE IMPLANTS WERE SILENTLY LEAKING (OR OOZING) WHILE IMPLANTED DUE TO A NATURAL DEGRADATION OF THE SHELL OVER THE 7 YEARS. I HAD THEM IN MY BODY. I AM CERTAIN MY BODY, SPECIFICALLY MY AUTOIMMUNE SYSTEM, WAS RESPONDING TO THIS SLOW LEAK AND AS A RESULT, BECAME EXHAUSTED, TRIGGERING THE CASCADE OF SYMPTOMS THAT WORSENED OVER TIME. I BEGAN REPORTING SYMPTOMS TO MY NEPHROLOGIST IN 2014 AND WENT TO VARIOUS MD'S OVER THE NEXT 2 YEARS TRYING TO SOLVE THE RIDDLE OF MY POOR HEALTH. BESIDES A MINOR VITAMIN D ISSUE AND HIGH LDL CHOLESTEROL. THERE WAS NOTHING TO INDICATE I HAD AN AUTOIMMUNE DISORDER. HOWEVER, MY SYMPTOMS PERSISTED TO THE POINT THAT I WASN'T SLEEPING AT NIGHT AND ACHED ALL OVER. I'VE ALSO SINCE HAD AN ABNORMAL MAMMOGRAM AND ULTRASOUND IN (B)(6) 2016 AND AM PENDING THE BIOPSY RESULTS (SHOULD HAVE THIS ON (B)(6) 2016.)|MEMORY GEL SILICONE BREAST IMPLANTS||10/05/2016||||*|*||I|FTR|2.0||BREAST IMPLANTS||5972395|||||MENTOR|||||||True

I HAD AN APPENDECTOMY IN (B)(6) OF 2014 AND CONTINUED WITH CHRONIC STOMACH PAIN AND HEADACHES UNTIL I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CELIAC DISEASE VIA BIOPSY IN (B)(6) OF 2014. WHILE MY STOMACH SYMPTOMS SUBSIDED DUE TO DIET CHANGE I CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE CHRONIC DIARRHEA AND CONSTIPATION. TEST FOR CROHN'S AND ULCERATIVE COLITIS WAS NEGATIVE. I BEGAN EXPERIENCING CHRONIC FATIGUE. IN EARLY (B)(6) OF 2015 I BECAME VERY ILL: MY SYMPTOMS WERE AS FOLLOWS; EXTREME FATIGUE, EYE PAIN, EYE BURNING, PHOTOPHOBIA, HEADACHE, BODY ACHES, BACK PAIN (UPPER AND LOWER), NECK PAIN, NAUSEA, LOSS OF APPETITE, WEIGHT GAIN THAT LASTED UNTIL (B)(6) OF 2016. IN (B)(6) I HAD AN AUTOIMMUNE PANEL. MY ELISA ANA WAS POSITIVE AND SO WAS MY ANTI-CLQ IGG. HOWEVER, SLE, RHEUMATOID FACTOR, ENA, ANTI-PHOSPHOLIPID, AND ANTI-THYROID WERE ALL NEGATIVE. IN NOVEMBER 2015 I ALSO SAW AN OPHTHALMOLOGIST WHO DID NOT SEE ANY INFLAMMATION IN THE EYE BUT DID SUGGEST SICCA. IN JANUARY, WHILE MY SYMPTOMS HAD SUBSIDED SLIGHTLY BUT NOT COMPLETELY, I SAW A NEUROLOGIST FOR HEADACHES. A MRI WAS ORDERED AND RESULTS WERE NORMAL, BUT HE SUGGESTED MY SYMPTOMS WERE RHEUMATOLOGICAL. A RHEUMATOLOGIST ORDERED A MRI AND X-RAYS OF MY UPPER AND LOWER BACK. I WAS ALSO TESTED FOR HLA-B27 WHICH CAME BACK POSITIVE. THERE WERE NO RADIOGRAPHIC CHANGES, HOWEVER, BASED ON MY CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND POSITIVE TEST FOR HLA-B27 I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS. I WAS PRESCRIBED CELECOXIB WHICH IMPROVED MY BACK PAIN BUT DID NOT IMPROVE MY OTHER SYMPTOMS. I AM CURRENTLY BEING TESTED FOR LYME DISEASE AND RECHECKING MY THYROID LEVELS. I CURRENTLY HAVE OVER 20 SYMPTOMS WHICH ARE AS FOLLOWS: DRY EYE/HAIR/SKIN, HAIR LOSS, EAR RINGING, EYE PAIN, HEADACHE, HEART PALPITATIONS, INSOMNIA, ITCHING UNDER RIGHT IMPLANT, LOWER/UPPER BACK PAIN, NECK PAIN, MOUTH SORES, MUSCLE PAIN, MUSCLE TWITCHING, CHEST PAIN, COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION, CONSTIPATION, NIGHT SWEATS, PHOTOPHOBIA, SKIN RASH (ONCE ON FOREHEAD), JOINT PAIN, EKG WAS NORMAL.

5801905|49945687|D|1||OVER THE LAST 15 YEARS MY HEALTH HAS DECLINED. THE FIRST 10 OF THOSE YEARS I DEVELOPED FATIGUE, HORMONAL IMBALANCES, REOCCURRING YEAST INFECTIONS, ACNE AND RANDOM PAIN THROUGHOUT MY BODY ALONG WITH VARIOUS OTHER UNEXPLAINED AILMENTS. THESE SYMPTOMS CONTINUALLY GOT WORSE AND MORE SYMPTOMS STARTED OCCURRING. THE PAST 4 YEARS I BEGIN HAVING SO MUCH PAIN IN MY FEET AND LEGS THAT I COULD BARELY WALK. I WAS TESTED FOR PLANTARS FASCIITIS WHICH CAME BACK NEGATIVE, PHYSICAL THERAPY AND CHIROPRACTIC APPOINTMENTS BECAUSE WAS TOLD POSSIBLE NERVE PINCH IN LOWER BACK. THREE YEARS AGO THE PAIN CREPT UP INTO MY HANDS AND ARMS AND CONTINUING THROUGHOUT MY WHOLE BODY FEELING AS THOUGH SOMEONE HAD DUMPED CHEMICAL ACID ON MY BODY TO THE POINT ALL I COULD DO IS LAY IN BED AT NIGHT AND WISH I WOULD DIE. IN APPROX (B)(6) 2014, MY WHOLE BODY DECIDED TO REACT BY NOT BEING UNABLE TO REGULATE ITS BODY TEMPERATURE, EXTREME DIZZINESS TO THE POINT OF BLACKOUTS, EXTREME FATIGUE TO WHERE I BARELY COULD FUNCTION FOR A FEW HOURS THEN WOULD HAVE TO SLEEP, I FELT AS THOUGH I WAS SUFFOCATING ALL THE TIME, MY HANDS BEGAN SHAKING TO THE POINT I COULD NOT HOLD MY PHONE OR A GLASS. I COULD NOT THINK CLEARLY AND WAS HAVING EXTREME MEMORY LOSS, I WENT FROM HAVING 20/20 VISION TO NEEDING TRIFOCALS IN A MATTER OF LESS THAN A YEAR. THE PAIN IN MY BODY GOT WORSE AND NEVER LET UP. I HAVE TO KEEP MY HOME AT ABOUT 68 DEGREES BECAUSE HEAT MAKES THE CHEMICAL ACID BURNING INCREASE 10 FOLD, I HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME LEAVING MY HOME BECAUSE I LIVE IN THE DESERT AND THE SUN LITERALLY MAKES MY SKIN FEEL AS THOUGH IT IS BLISTERING. BETWEEN (B)(6) 2014 AND (B)(6) 2015 I LOST (B)(6) POUNDS UNEXPLAINABLY. ON (B)(6) 2015 MY PRIMARY PHYSICIAN WROTE ME OUT OF WORK FOR A WEEK THEN 2 WEEKS THEN FOR AN UNDETERMINED AMOUNT OF TIME AND SAID I NEEDED TO SEE A NEUROLOGIST. I FOLLOWED UP WITH A NEUROLOGIST WHO SAID HE BELIEVED I HAD PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY, BUT PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY DID NOT FIT ALL THE SYMPTOMS I WAS HAVING. AT THIS POINT I STARTED GOING TO THE (B)(6) CLINIC IN LATE (B)(6) 2015 WHO BY JUST MY SYMPTOMS FIGURED I HAD EITHER LUPUS, MS, HODGKIN'S DISEASE, LYME DISEASE OR SOME OTHER AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE. THEY PERFORMED MULTIPLE MRI'S, CAT SCANS, PET SCANS, BLOOD AND URINE TESTS, NERVE TESTS, HEART TESTS, LUNG TESTS AND MANY OTHER TESTS TO TRY AND DETERMINE WHY I WAS SICK. THEY DID DETERMINE THAT MY BLOOD PRESSURE WAS EXTREMELY LOW AND WOULD BOTTOM OUT IF I STOOD OR MOVE TOO QUICKLY CAUSING THE DIZZINESS AND BLACKOUTS. WHICH IS OPPOSITE OF WHAT I WAS 4 YEARS AGO TAKING MEDICINE FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. THEY DETERMINED I HAD EARLY STAGES OF EMPHYSEMA AND COPD. THE PET SCAN SHOWED NO TYPE OF CANCER, AND MY BLOOD WORK CAME BACK FINE OTHER THAN MY C-REACTIVE PROTEIN WAS AT 18. AT THIS POINT THEY DETERMINED I HAD AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE FOR UNK REASONS WITH SMALL FIBER NEUROPATHY. NONE OF THE MEDICATIONS OR THE INTERVENOUS STEROIDS RELIEVED MY SYMPTOMS. IN (B)(6) 2015, MY DAUGHTER DISCOVERED WHAT IS KNOWN AS BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESS. ALL THE SYMPTOMS LISTED FOR THIS WAS WHAT I WAS DEALING WITH. I HAD MY IMPLANTS REMOVED (B)(6) ENBLOCK STYLE WITH CAPSULES COMPLETELY REMOVED. SINCE THIS TIME I HAVE STEADILY FELT MY HEALTH RETURNING.

5999435|56587047|D|1||"MY NAME IS (B)(6). I HAVE MENTOR SILICONE COHESIVE GEL IMPLANTS. ONE HAS RUPTURED (VERIFIED VIA ULTRASOUND AND MRI IN (B)(6) 2016). I HAVE SILICONE IN MY LYMPH NODES AS A RESULT. IT CONTINUES TO SPREAD THROUGHOUT MY BODY UNTIL I CAN HAVE SURGERY TO HAVE MY IMPLANTS AND SILICONE REMOVED. EVEN AFTER SURGERY, I WILL LIKELY NEED OTHER MEDICAL ATTENTION TO RID THE SILICONE FROM MY BODY. SINCE HAVING IMPLANTS, I HAVE DEVELOPED SEVERE HYPOTHYROIDISM, THYROID MASSES, SEVERE BRAIN FOG TO THE POINT WHERE I CAN BARELY HANDLE DAY TO DAY SITUATIONS LET ALONE CONTINUE WORK. IT SEEMS TO GET WORSE BY THE DAY. I HAVE BEEN TIRED, WEAK, AND CONSTANTLY SICK. NO ONE TOLD ME WHEN I RECEIVED IMPLANTS THAT THERE WERE ANY NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS, LET ALONE RUPTURE. NO ONE TOLD ME MY HEALTH WOULD BE EXTREMELY DETERIORATED DUE TO IMPLANTS. NO ONE TOLD ME THAT SINCE I DON'T FORM SCAR TISSUE TO FORM A ""CAPSULE"" TO HOLD THE IMPLANT IN PLACE, THAT I WOULD NEED MORE SURGERIES AND THE IMPLANT WOULD NEED TO BE SEWED TO MY INSIDES. NO ONE TELLS YOU THESE THINGS WHEN YOU GET IMPLANTS. THE SURGEON TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE 100% SAFE AND THEY ARE NOT. THERE ARE THOUSANDS, PERHAPS MILLIONS, OF WOMEN STRUGGLING TO LIVE LIFE DUE TO COMPLICATIONS AND PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THEIR IMPLANTS. I DON'T THINK THIS IS RIGHT, AND I DON'T WANT ANYONE ELSE TO GO THROUGH WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH."|COHESIVE GEL IMPLANTS||10/02/2016||||*|*||I|FTR|2.0||COHESIVE GEL IMPLANTS|||||||MENTOR|||||||True
5935385|54346448|D|1||IN (B)(6) 2003, I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER IN MY LEFT BREAST. I HAD A LUMPECTOMY WITH MULTIPLE LYMPH NODE REMOVAL AND WAS SCHEDULED FOR 40 ROUNDS OF RADIATION. BECAUSE I HAVE A SKIN DISORDER CALLED SOLAR URTICARIA, I KNEW I COULD NOT DO RADIATION BUT DOCTORS IN MY TOWN DID NOT KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT IT TO SAY YES OR NO. I WENT TO (B)(6) CLINIC DOWN IN (B)(6) AND HAD A BILATERAL MASTECTOMY. IN (B)(6) 2004, I HAD MY SURGERY WITH TEMPORARY EXPANDERS. WHEN MY BREAST WERE READY WE EXCHANGED THEM FOR SILICONE IMPLANTS. IN (B)(6) OF THAT SAME YEAR 2004, I BECAME ILL WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND WAS PLACED ON TWO MEDICINES. IN 2009, I HAD TO HAVE MY IMPLANTS REPLACED BECAUSE OF A RUPTURE IN THE RIGHT IMPLANT. THEY WERE REPLACED WITH A SECOND PAIR OF SILICONE IMPLANTS. I BECAME SERIOUSLY ILL IN (B)(6) OF 2012 WITH COLLAGENOUS COLITIS, HOSPITALIZED AND BATTLED THAT THREE SEPARATE TIMES. I WAS PUT ON A GLUTEN FREE, LOW-FAT, LOW FIBER RESIDUAL DIET FROM A VERY RENOWNED LOCAL G. I. DOCTOR. I TRIED AND EXPERIENCED A 2 GALLON (B)(6) BAG OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT DID NOT WORK FOR ME DURING THIS ENTIRE JOURNEY. A DIET THAT I STILL PRACTICE TO THIS DAY. I CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE STOMACH PAIN AND EXTREME NAUSEA. I BEGAN TO HAVE SEVERE JOINT AND MUSCLE ACHES WORSE THEN MY RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS HAD EVER BEEN. I SAW YET ANOTHER G. I. DOCTOR FROM (B)(6) (ONE OF THE BEST) AND VISITED (B)(6) CLINIC BOTH G. I., DEPARTMENT AND RHEUMATOLOGY TWO TIMES IN TWO SEPARATE YEARS. I'VE HAD ENDLESS COLONOSCOPIES, ENDOSCOPIES, BRAIN SCANS, PANCREAS PROTOCOL, EXTENSIVE BLOODWORK, 2 GASTRIC EMPTYING TEST, WITH ONE TEST INDICATING POSITIVE AT (B)(6). HOWEVER, THE SECOND TEST AT (B)(6) CLINIC SHOWED NEGATIVE. EVERY ORGAN IN MY BODY WAS CHECKED AND RECHECKED. SO ONCE AGAIN MY ILLNESS WAS UNDETERMINED AND UNEXPLAINED! NOW I HAD BEEN 3 1/2 YEARS. THANK GOODNESS I RETIRED THE YEAR I GOT ILL OR I WOULD HAVE BEEN FORCED TO QUIT. I FINALLY WAS TOLD BY THE RHEUMATOLOGIST AT (B)(6) CLINIC THAT IT WAS FIBROMYALGIA. IN (B)(6) 2016, I FOUND A SPECIALIST DR. (B)(6) IN (B)(6). HE FOUND OUT THAT I ALSO HAD MANY FOOD ALLERGIES, FOUR ACTIVE DNA CHILDHOOD VIRUSES AND A DEFICIENCY IN VITAMIN D. ALTHOUGH ONCE HE FOUND OUT I HAD BREAST IMPLANTS SILICONE, HE SUGGESTED I GET THEM OUT IMMEDIATELY. I HAD SPOKEN WITH MY PLASTIC SURGEON A YEAR AND A HALF AGO ABOUT THIS VERY ISSUE OF MY IMPLANTS BECAUSE MY RIGHT IMPLANT HAD BEEN BOTHERING ME AGAIN AND I WAS IN FEAR OF ANOTHER RUPTURE. WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM ABOUT WHAT DR. (B)(6) HAD SUGGESTED HE ALSO AGREED. I HAD AN EXPLANT ON (B)(6) 2016. I'M WRITING THIS ON (B)(6) 2016. NOTE: WHEN I WOKE UP FROM ANESTHESIA AFTER EXPLANT I HAD 0 JOINT PAIN. WE ARE WAITING FOR THE OTHER SYMPTOMS TO EITHER DISAPPEAR OR DIMINISH. OUT OF THE 63 SYMPTOMS OF BREAST IMPLANT ILLNESS, I HAD 36! THEREFORE, IT WILL TAKE ME A LONG TIME FOR MY BODY TO RECOVER, IF EVER FULLY. THIS DECISION TO REMOVE MY BREASTS FOR THE 2ND TIME WAS A DIFFICULT ONE ESPECIALLY WITH THIS OUTCOME. I DO NOT HAVE BREASTS BECAUSE OF MY BILATERAL MASTECTOMY. MY PLASTIC SURGEON DID A WONDERFUL JOB USING FAT TRANSFER FROM MY ABDOMEN IN ORDER TO FILL IN THE HOLES IN MY CHEST. YOU SEE, I'M VERY THIN. WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN VERY ILL FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS. I DID NOT HAVE MUCH FAT AT ALL TO HELP WITH THIS PROCEDURE. TODAY, I SAW MY PLASTIC SURGEON AND HE HAD TO DRAIN FLUID FROM THIS RIGHT BREAST AGAIN. SO WE ARE STILL DEALING WITH THIS SITUATION. BUT I AM OPTIMISTIC THAT REMOVING THE IMPLANTS WERE MY LAST HOPE AND GETTING MY BODY HEALTHY AGAIN. I TRULY BELIEVE THAT MY IMPLANTS CAUSED MY ILLNESS AND THAT OTHER WOMEN HEAR MY STORY.|SILICONE IMPLANTS||09/02/2016||||*|*||I|FTR|2.0||SILICONE IMPLANTS|||||||MENTOR|||||||True
